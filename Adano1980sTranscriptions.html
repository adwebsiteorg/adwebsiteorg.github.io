<p>Adano83_07_26FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3 - Many of us may not know too much of the meaning of Darshan and even those who are initiated sometimes have vague understanding of the word itself, the mechanics, let alone what is involved in the experience. Before we meditate the brain, before it entered the house, it&rsquo;s in a state of excitement getting here, trying to decide for the traffic, it really can&rsquo;t dip deep into the core of its structure. So at a Satsang which means fellowship with truth, the individual who is the focal point who has been spending many years dipping into this potential of their nature, acts of a sort of a resonating device that lines up the alpha wave of the brain of the student so that the brain can then dip into a non-verbal state. So you feel like for a brief moment everything is suspended, there are no words coming up, you&rsquo;re in a state of expectancy but that state, that brief moment is known as Darshan, the whole sight, the devotion of heart, not of brain. There is no verbalization, the internal dialogue has temporarily suspended itself between left and right halves of the brain. Now it gives you the initiate and the word initiate simply means the individual who is going to work on their internal mechanism and has the privilege to work with it by being locked in to certain laws of nature and having prepared themselves by cleaning the body, making it less toxic, they can better resonate with their inner consciousness. In the olden days they would call that baptism and when Jesus went to John he said, &ldquo;You baptize me&rdquo; and John said, &ldquo;No you baptized me&rdquo; and picture two grown people arguing who should throw water on each other&rsquo;s head. But then he said &ldquo;Suffer it to be so for this is the way of righteousness&rdquo; which merely means relate to the inner laws by synchronicity with someone who has delved deep in to synchronize. That doesn&rsquo;t make the person superior to you or somebody pull you by the nose, it is like going to a battery charger and renovating the battery and bringing it back up to full charge so we do need these periodical encounters which is called Satsang. Now it can be in the presence of the person or in the absence of the person so we realize the form is not the connecting link, it&rsquo;s the attitude. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;suffer it to be so,&rdquo; it other words go in, suspend the internal dialogue so that the potential that you are begins to come up. Those who have never been initiated they&rsquo;ll also feel a charge that will stir them to want to know how to actually work in the detoxification and centering of themselves. It&rsquo;s a sort of an encouragement to the individual and those who have already been initiated, it&rsquo;s a reinforcement of what you call your annual carburetor tune-up, getting the machine to be more and more specific to its internal potential. So it has two advantages: one, it helps to suspend the internal dialogue that is so difficult to do being involved in living in this environment that is composed of sonics and you can&rsquo;t help talking, from the day you&rsquo;re born everybody&rsquo;s talking to you. Even when you go to bed, you&rsquo;re dreaming that someone&rsquo;s talking inside so you do need periods to suspend that dialog just to get centering. I know you may have lots of questions and answers that you&rsquo;re waiting for but before we take that as initiates, just to bring ourselves back to the important concept of our nature. One person asked &ldquo;what is the most important role as a human being?&rdquo; And this was the answer that came back from many many religious and spiritual leaders and even if you track it down historically in the writings, the importance is to realize you are an initiate of the highest consciousness, to realize that you have the tools to work with internally, scientifically to validate your true reality, and it has nothing to do with the individual or individuals who come and go, they are just the finished product. It&rsquo;s up to you to finish your job and go through the process and realize it. We pay respect to those who go ahead of us, yes, because they&rsquo;re the ones who innately sense their true potential either by sickness or some intense yearning from a previous life or because they have some function to perform while they&rsquo;re alive but whatever drives them to that research, from that moment on you&rsquo;re involved with a non-image, love for God. &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other graven image before Me.&rdquo; It is your contribution to the you in you to prove it once and for all that He became you and that&rsquo;s why they instituted initiation or baptism thousands of years ago and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what school or avenue we come from or use to get that, many roads lead to the door right here. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many roads it took to get here and I had to fly in an airplane to get here, yet I have to come through that one door, see what I mean? 0:10 The door is in the heart and that&rsquo;s how Yogananda would say &ldquo;Door of my heart open wide I keep for Thee. Wilt Thou come, wilt Thou come, just for once come to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even just once incarnation give me the living experience of my potential, restore my memory, restore my conviction of the reality that Creator has become his Creation. No longer lets me live in the conflicts or intra-polarity of the right brain and left brain. Let me center, let me have what they call peace that passes understanding.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a peace that the world gives, the world gives you six feet under the ground, it&rsquo;s called tranquility in the grave and may you rest in peace. The peace of the initiate or the Soul Potential is the strength of peace, the capacity to keep coping with daily challenges and going through them. This peace the world can&rsquo;t give us, only the Christ nature in you, the God nature in you gives you that from your self-confrontation but you need human beings to divert your attention to that point of reference. They may be called teachers or guides or Gurus, what is more important, not they, is that the student is not greater than the teacher and the teacher not greater than the student, they both got to go there. We both have to come to this door to greet each other tonight so our roles are not important, who is teacher and who is student, what is important we are initiates of the Spirit. We are initiated into the Spirit to find our own potential, we are baptized, we are brought into the inner contact devoid of outer trappings, devoid of outer images. We start off our early growth by relating to images and finally we mature into the one real temple because Creative Life lives in it. One of the hardest things in this process is to know another human being can hurt you after you&rsquo;ve done things for them, what would generate compassion from your heart for them? Yet a parent has to generate compassion for his child regardless if the child does all kinds of things. So you&rsquo;re given preparation in compassionate love from the time you become a parent, let alone humanity. That is the basis of the growth of your spirituality, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking for. It&rsquo;s a non-verbal relationship, more and more it&rsquo;s the internal joyousness to release it but even teachers get angry and tear down the money changers you know and drive them out of the church saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it a gambling place.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll spank us once in a while or pull our ears and let us know &ldquo;quit your nonsense&rdquo; once in a while, get on the ball and look in at yourself, that comes occasionally. So sometimes there are a lot of dry periods in your spiritual process when you feel that you&rsquo;re left out but you&rsquo;re not. As soon as the internal dialogue suspends itself, it&rsquo;s flashing up again, the realization goes up. And that&rsquo;s why the institution or the idea came of &ldquo;when two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; This is more intended scientifically for the initiate than for the regular person who is just interested in meeting in a meditation meeting because the real communication goes on with the initiate from that standpoint with his own Christ nature. He is pulling together his Christ nature and allowing it to release its potential through this mechanism. That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;when two or three are gathered in My name,&rdquo; not in me Jesus or me Adano, it&rsquo;s when we as initiates gather into the sense of remembrance at the time of initiation, that contact it pulls and nurtures and feeds and a Darshan, or whole sight, total sight, that is the capacity to see through, not see at. It&rsquo;s a feeling that you sense when it&rsquo;s occurring like a suspension, that is the whole name, &ldquo;in My name.&rdquo; The Creative Intelligence is Sonics and we can call Him God or Father, some people call Him all types of names. American Indians call Him Great Spirit but it&rsquo;s a vibrancy that is exchanged at the human level, that makes it more important as an experience than something that has happening and there are no human beings around. It is when you meet another human being and that human being is locking into the potential and can allow this vibrancy to emanate, then you in turn, it&rsquo;s like a magnet, you become magnetized, you can now release it yourself, it works through you also. My experience came from my teacher and I give the credit to him and he will always say his came from his teacher and we all go back and say &ldquo;Okay God, You did Your thing&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s fine and good, we respect that. The important thing is that you know it works and you know it exists and it&rsquo;s not a verbal experience, it&rsquo;s a non-verbal experience of presence. Meditation is the nurturing and trying to always retain the feeling of the Darshan or the effect or the sensation that occurred during initiation. Meditation is that particular nurturing attitude to recapture it or to re-enhance it and the more you meditate, the more you&rsquo;ll re-enhance it to the extent where it starts bubbling inside of you. Put it this way, my good friend the Pentecostal minister says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need no alcohol from the bottle, I got enough alcohol going inside of me, it bubbles into champagne&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s what this sensation of the whole Spirit the whole sight is all about is that same principle. 0:20 This sensitivity of knowing that it&rsquo;s waves that suspend the verbal dialogue and allow you to feel and reach out to the memory banks of various levels of yourself. Now I know when you take a little drink you always feel like like you&rsquo;re &ldquo;out there?&rdquo; Good. As my friend would say, &ldquo;this is a natural high,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to enhance. The main goal behind that or process behind that more than a goal is a cellular transformation is occurring in you though you may not realize it at the time. As an initiate as you become more conscious and meditate, that means enhancing and trying to re-enhance that feeling and having the verbal dialogue suspending itself more and more, an immunity begins to increase. You can cut yourself it heals very fast, you can seem to deprive yourself of many things you couldn&rsquo;t do before and a gradual strength and self-confidence, a strength of peace to cope with conditions of life becomes obvious, you&rsquo;re getting stronger in yourself. You realize that and you&rsquo;re no longer running to find the happiness in secluded areas, you&rsquo;re standing on your two feet and experiencing the happiness and the peace of mind right where you are. You start out searching and running to different areas for the peace, only to return back to find it&rsquo;s already bubbling up. That is to say in the early stages of your encounter with Spirit you&rsquo;re like the grape on the vine, then initiation is like somebody plucked you off the vine and they did this to you, (laughter) and your dry spells has got to do with all this stuff here. Periodically they&rsquo;ll put this in the jar and it starts the fermentation, it&rsquo;s gonna be very tricky job too because it can be wine or vinegar, but we can&rsquo;t stop at the wine because that would be a psychic level of our growth. It&rsquo;s good, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that is called gift of Spirit but it&rsquo;s not fruit of Spirit. It is the next stage, the enhancing where Satsang is. You meet the person or they&rsquo;re not even there, the Satsang doesn&rsquo;t stop, the Satsang is going on now at a cellular level inside with eyes open or eyes shut. The verbal dialogue can be suspended now at your command, this is shifting into the champagne level. Therefore they call that Samadhi or God-realization in the waking state, the moving state, that&rsquo;s the champagne state. Wine is the non-moving state where you sit down like this and you&rsquo;re drunk with it but the moment you get up, it&rsquo;s all gone, you rush back, that&rsquo;s the wine state. So you&rsquo;re afraid to get up and move around lest the verbalizations keep rushing back in and the peace seems to get weaker but don&rsquo;t quit, just go again. And it&rsquo;s being reinforced by those who love you as in the Eye of the Cyclone written by Dr. Lilly, you&rsquo;re not without others looking on who are deeply concerned with your well-being no matter what level you&rsquo;re at, that&rsquo;s nice to know. But no matter what level you think you&rsquo;re in, there&rsquo;s always somebody watching to pull you back up and that&rsquo;s good to know that we never really can fall short of the Creative Presence. So out of sight is not out of mind, you&rsquo;re always in tune with the individual and it pulls you up so you can move from the wine stage or the non-moving stage to the champagne stage, the ever-moving stage, that&rsquo;s the purpose behind it to get you there to be your own bottle of champagne and flip out your own cork (laughter). And Darshan or Satsang is that intent, that&rsquo;s the whole intent behind it, the whole mechanics behind it is to get you the initiated grape to move on into the champagne level of yourself. That&rsquo;s the students went to Jesus and he said &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t touch your feet, you&rsquo;re not in me.&rdquo; If I don&rsquo;t make contact with you or if you don&rsquo;t see or relate or get together, there is no enhancing of (inaudible). See that&rsquo;s how for centuries Man realized that a Satsang or a group sitting down was more important than books. Books are good but books don&rsquo;t give you the level of non-verbalization, you have to sit down in the presence with loved ones and activate the memory that triggered you in the first place to be interested in yourself and feel that vibrancy permeate you and suspend the verbalization and that allows you to extend that nonverbal quality longer and longer to the extent that you can get up and walk with it. Another quality of Satsang, which is fellowship or two or three gatherings in my Name, is the exposure to transfiguration. When the disciples were with their teacher Jesus in the Garden and he asked them to pray a while with him which means to sit down and suspend the verbalization, later on one said that they saw two other great Souls standing next to the teacher: Moses and Elijah and one brave soul said, Peter, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a tabernacle or a covenant,&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll make a commitment at this point in time in our own nature to really try to suspend the verbalization so that we can have more of this exposure to the transfiguration. Transfiguration is both visual and internal, biological. You may see facial changes on the person, interposing phases of the unity of the atom and the oneness of life at the visual level. That&rsquo;s just the skin of the banana, the real banana you want to eat now let alone get the oil, comes from inside. The real eternal transfiguration is the closing of the eyes and at the portal door where all of us merge, we come through embracing you from inside then you are transfigured. 0:30 And they have only one message for you, &ldquo;We who have crossed the threshold of silence yearn for you to cross that threshold and to merge in the unity of yourself and may you be transfigured into your eternal Now. Then a strange thing will happen, when you open the eyes to look out you may not see anything for a few seconds and you&rsquo;ll wonder where you are, don&rsquo;t get scared. Having crossed the threshold of silence, you&rsquo;ve crossed the threshold of Sonics which means the Father outside of the vibratory creation. The Father as a Son, He&rsquo;s His own Son, is the Creative Intelligence in the vibratory creation of sonics, &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father but I go unto the Father,&rdquo; that came later. The realized Man goes on to the next level, he has to go on to the next level but he must experience the first level of hearing the Sonics, having an outward exposure to the transfiguring experience of physical laws, things seem to go hazy, it&rsquo;s like looking down the road on a hot day. Don&rsquo;t get scared, it&rsquo;s just natural laws going on, you&rsquo;re not hallucinating and it&rsquo;s occurring naturally within you, it&rsquo;s allowing you to have total sight into the reality. Then you&rsquo;ll cross that threshold where there is no verbalization, there is no matching, there is no language in it. For that brief moment you have crossed through there, you are with the Father then you know for sure without doubt, He became (inaudible). Ego, individuality are all left behind in the Sonic level, in the verbalization level and a collective unity of oneness is very very pronounced in your mechanism. So I can appreciate your feeling when you said &ldquo;you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;re gonna (inaudible)&rdquo; that was because you were feeling it at a sonic level in the engulfment with the water because in a strange way you survived, that intimacy of compassion plucked you to the next level and from now on you can cross the threshold and go into your Divinity. Do not be afraid of your divinity and you may admit like Saint Catherine, &ldquo;Give me back my brother Jesus&rdquo; because she sees her own self, she prefers to have someone to respect, we all do that. I myself looks to Yogananda or living teachers because one cannot really worship a total non-image even though it became you. It would be a sense of non-appreciation for those who went before you who made you conscious but whatever time they triggered that consciousness in you to recognize it. So you are no longer afraid or feel threatened by paying respect or loving adoration to the person who triggered you. That&rsquo;s how they wrote the book later on &ldquo;At the Feet of the Master&rdquo; but you don&rsquo;t see his face, you just see the foot and many Gurus have the name &ldquo;foot of God.&rdquo; A lot of these highly realized Masters, when you translate their name it&rsquo;s called paw or foot of God or the toe of God and it&rsquo;s very interesting the names that they have. It&rsquo;s no discredit to any of us, it&rsquo;s so fantastically loving, you just love it. Everyone is. If you feel to close your eyes and merge do so, if you feel to keep your eyes open do so, let presence flow. Fill yourself with presence, let your potential come to the surface, you&rsquo;re aiming for champagne. (Gap in tape). Audience: I want to hear your exposition on the enlightenment of the unmarried person, the everyday person. Adano: We use the word enlightenment but sometimes we really don&rsquo;t connect the experience, what it represents in terms of the spiritual life. In the spiritual life the enlightenment is the ability to recognize moment to moment the intrinsic timing of events occurring around you. How you as an individual is at a certain location, a certain time, and your reaction to the conditions based upon your expectancy. In the olden days they would say every action is determined by God, His will be done, but we never really can cope with it or get any experience to say that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will and if we fail we do say it&rsquo;s His will and if we win we do say it&rsquo;s His will but we never really understand what is His will in the first place in terms of the practical exposure, practical day-to-day living. So we tend to search for enlightenment as if it is going to totally eradicate all the veils of the existence. The enlightenment in the daily life and for the human being more than the ordinary man or woman, the human being per say, in the true spiritualness is recognition of timing. Many of you drove a lot of vehicles to come here, right? Did you buy sixty five hundred dollars worth of parts or sixty five hundred dollars worth of timing? Yet in a simple rational practical existence, it&rsquo;s taken for granted until it&rsquo;s brought into focus what you really have and what you&rsquo;re really experiencing and what frees you now from guilt complex. Spirituality aims to free you from guilt in the experience and aims to let you have the enlightenment or the understanding to be correct that doesn&rsquo;t have a feedback of guilt because there is no good or bad. 0:40 Like Omar Khayyam would say &ldquo;I myself am heaven and hell&rdquo; but heaven in the sense of a haven or reservoir, hell in the sense of &ldquo;h-e-l-d,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m held back by my own inability to time myself. Nobody is holding me back, I am holding my one-self back and that is because I&rsquo;m out of time and if we look at production and production simply represents repetition, you can say &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; now, mechanical rosary, repeating over and over, Xeroxing, do you see? You&rsquo;re getting the understanding, you&rsquo;re getting the enlightenment then you&rsquo;re again recognizing that you&rsquo;re forced to synchronize with timing. That automatically liberates you from a guilt process of living that drains you off and then you feel left out and in actuality it&rsquo;s not true. The enlightenment or the freedom from, that&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;free men all, lord of yourself&rdquo; but s-e-l-f can be very misleading and can be very nebulous and very authoritative and very deistic whereas c-e-l-l, &ldquo;free men all, lord of the cell,&rdquo; lord of these cells. This is an intrinsic battery, each one of them, it&rsquo;s an intrinsic machinery, it&rsquo;s an intrinsic powerhouse, it&rsquo;s a conditioned atom. You as consciousness is in-resident in it and the interconnectedness of timing makes you more appreciative of it therefore freeing you of the guilt feedbacks as you become synchronized to its internal rhythms. The whole frontier of reality opens itself for you now in the unlimitedness of it that there is no limitation to God, it is called to the greater glory of God. To this end Jesus healed the blind man, not because of karma if he from a past life that he is born blind or the parents which is heredity but it&rsquo;s the challenge within each one of us to pull it together in the cellular structure and realize or feel and time yourself, lock into your intrinsic timing now recognized as the true will of God. Why would the Creator create to punish? He doesn&rsquo;t punish, He provides one basic law for the whole creation to function on, we know as Newton&rsquo;s first law, right? In the East we know it as karma and to the churchianistic thinking it is &ldquo;what you sow, you reap,&rdquo; and the cowboys are singing it now, (inaudible) but karma or whatever you want to call it is still centered on timing. If you look at it objectively and don&rsquo;t be swayed by its forcefulness on you, you will free the brain from the feedback of guilt and look at it as the opportunity to rise above your limitations and that is really the full enlightenment of the human being. &ldquo;To him that overcometh,&rdquo; I will do what? &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t send forth a second time.&rdquo; You see all these things are coming to have more valid meaning and possible experience. Before it would seem nebulous not when you look at it in terms of timing and when you have to live a day-to-day life of basic survival regardless of what you believe in and when the cost factor of existence tells you where it&rsquo;s at, put up or shut up, then you know timing is God&rsquo;s will in your life like it or not. It doesn&rsquo;t take away from the old traditional way of describing the sacredness of God to you, in fact it removes the weakness of it with your own self-fear of integrating with it and it imparts a strength which you never had before and that&rsquo;s the strength of peace. &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give,&rdquo; the peace that comes from within your own I AM-ness of understanding your structure. This is strength, you can live it and not feel threatened by it and to sum it up in a working behavior of enlightenment or understanding, it is acting what you say to yourself. Years ago when I came into this area and I happened to go on the reservation and I grew up hearing this statement many times when they said that the Indians accused the white man of speaking with a forked tongue and I always wanted to know what that really meant and I have a friend who I&rsquo;m going to see pretty soon and he said &ldquo;pale face speak with forked tongue.&rdquo; And I looked at my tongue in the mirror and I couldn&rsquo;t see where it was forked and then try to get their version, &ldquo;he lies, he doesn&rsquo;t convey what he means&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not really what it was. The Indian on the reservation today or in the frontier days realized that in their structural language, it was designed to act what they say. Whereas in english it&rsquo;s not so designed, one word has many different meanings and this creates a conflict when spoken to another person who is linearly conditioned to act out what he says and doesn&rsquo;t have flexibility. Then he will accuse you for being double talking and meaning different shades of the meaning and therefore you can get into all kind of wrong understandings in communication. Yet by the same token, rigid language, linear in itself can be a prison and a flexible language can be a treasure. You can restrict yourself in one word with one meaning and at the same time you can liberate yourself with that same word by having a different meaning especially if you&rsquo;re traumatized, I&rsquo;ll give you an example. For the actual layman, as you would say, looking for enlightenment moment to moment, d-o-g, now you must be thankful to english the only language you can do this with, d-o-g is man&rsquo;s best friend, agreed? You spell it backwards it&rsquo;s still the man&rsquo;s best friend. (Laughter). 0:50 Now you can&rsquo;t do that with any other language no matter how you try so we have a unique experience here by speaking english. Many nationalities can use for the first time a guilt-free communication to their internal self, it&rsquo;s very very interesting because you don&rsquo;t feel threatened no more as you begin to look at the simplicity and the naturalness of the language and the timing of the events. Years ago, I&rsquo;ll give you an example in my own life, I&rsquo;d an appointment to go to and I&rsquo;d always think I would be late so I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get there before and I&rsquo;d get worked up with the feeling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late, I don&rsquo;t want to get late.&rdquo; So you burn up so much energy worrying about being late by the time you get there, all the red lights are in your favor. (Laughter). So one day I said to myself, &ldquo;enough of this wanting to be late, why can&rsquo;t the other guy be late and I be early? Why should I think that I&rsquo;m going to be late, can he not be late?&rdquo; I reversed the mental attitude, not feeling guilt or wishing him any kind of a bad accident or anything and so for the first time when I saw it work, I laughed, I arrived at my destination all green lights and he&rsquo;s busy apologizing for the red lights. (Laughter). Audience: I understand the timing with regards to outside events but how can we become conscious of the timing of our own selves? Adano: Time is a word that will make a lot of us think it does not exist since it&rsquo;s being conscious of where you are and you have to use your cells by breathing to be self-conscious and therefore you could say to yourself you have all the time in the world because all time is really Now and there is really no yesterday and there is really no tomorrow. Whatever occurred yesterday occurred in the Now of yesterday. Whatever will occur tomorrow will be in the Now of tomorrow when it occurs. So we can go around in circles talking to ourselves from within but eventually you will find that you will verbally zero in on the internal atomic light of the cell and then you would have a true picture of timing in the cellular structure. The distance light crosses the width of an electron is a unit of time in the cell. You are an atom conditioned onto a cellular form, you carry a tremendous power within you, the capacity to monitor called consciousness. Yet the only way you can validate it is to look inward and that&rsquo;s the direction every teacher gives, &ldquo;When the eyes,&rdquo; not one, he said both, &ldquo;are single,&rdquo; now how could you make two eyes single? Try as you like, looking outside it could never be single, it would be distorting all around. The only way it could singularly focus or singularly refer itself to or center itself, you have to close then you have a single vision and then closed vision. &ldquo;When the eyes are single, the whole body,&rdquo; now this is more scientific now, it&rsquo;s getting more scientific, no reference to any object outside the whole body, the whole cellular mechanism, &ldquo;IS,&rdquo; not was, IS &ldquo;full,&rdquo; capacity, &ldquo;of light.&rdquo; Now imagine a cellular mechanism being monitored by its own cell capabilities, the maximum light potential locked up in it and to zero in on specific measurements, each cell, each unit would involve light. And therefore a unit of time, if you&rsquo;re going to say time means an emission of this, that&rsquo;s time spelled backward, &ldquo;e-m-i-t,&rdquo; because this is really an emission mechanism and what is an emission, it&rsquo;s an energy field. As we get more specific, more objective and intrinsic, it has to go across certain dimensions and so to put it in a unit measurement to make it repetitious to be practical to survive, we will eventually recognize that this timing is propelling itself from within the atomic structure and therefore the distance it will travel across the width of the electron would give you your unit of timing inside of you. &ldquo;The light is shining in the darkness,&rdquo; here you become trapped now for the first time because when you look inside you see darkness and yet if you remember when you were initiated you saw a light within you, right? &ldquo;And the light is shining in the darkness but the darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; the very cell that is circular, that contains light, sets of a force field of darkness to compress the light, keeping the light in a state of &ldquo;capsuled down.&rdquo; The more you verbalize, the more the light disappears because you&rsquo;re putting up a shield in front of it. The less you&rsquo;ve verbalize, which is called the internal dialogue, the less you want to match words or your programming from the environment, the more the light seems to expand. &ldquo;Let your light so shine,&rdquo; that means diminish the verbalization in order for the force field of light to fill out and take over and push away the darkness. Before who? &ldquo;Let your light so shine before who?&rdquo; It only says Man, your fellow Man. &ldquo;That they may see the good works and glorify the Father which is in you.&rdquo; Others will feel or sense or actually see by the eyes when it&rsquo;s open this glow of total vision and they will sense a synchronicity with you. 1:00 From that moment on, whatever you put in the brain as a program like a computer, it punches up. Now picture for one moment you&rsquo;re in the place of the mind of Jesus, as Paul says &ldquo;Give me that mind that was in Christ&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re sitting there and somebody says to you &ldquo;Lazarus is dead&rdquo; and if you don&rsquo;t have any comprehension of what you are intrinsically, you may not be able to say &ldquo;Lazarus come forth.&rdquo; Now imagine when you said &ldquo;Lazarus come forth,&rdquo; out of the grave says &ldquo;No boss, I ain&rsquo;t getting up for you.&rdquo; That blows away all your realization about yourself but if the mechanism of Lazarus gets up and comes out and then you the person who is applying the law would suddenly say &ldquo;Father, I didn&rsquo;t have to say it in a loud voice, only because of the people around.&rdquo; Light, sonics, timing, rhythm. Now this phenomenon is not restricted only to the man Jesus because he was the very first man to say &ldquo;The things I do, you will do also and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; That lays the groundwork for greater things for him to experience too but if he says &ldquo;Not greater than me&rdquo; and &ldquo;no further than this,&rdquo; then you know where you are and you know who he is. But the principle doesn&rsquo;t do that in the mechanism, the principle is giving you greater and greater possibilities of yourself which then makes you more conscious of the internal cellular timing to the demand and you can&rsquo;t express it before the demand is there. You couldn&rsquo;t command the force to move if there is no demand. Who would fill a full cup, you see what I mean? So you couldn&rsquo;t express any motion on your part if there is no demand for it, the timing is always evidence of the demand and your ability to synchronize to fit the demand. So again no-thing moves except by Divine Will, there is no object moving in proper synchronicity if it wants to perform efficiently. If it doesn&rsquo;t want to perform efficiently it would be out of what? Synchronicity. Everything to perform efficiently must be in its state of synchronicity, this is Divine Will, nothing moves except by Divine Will. It&rsquo;s another way of saying no physical function or cosmic function or intrinsic function is occurring without synchronicity. So don&rsquo;t feel that timing, though reduced to represent Divine Will, is a mundane thing, it&rsquo;s not a mundane thing, it&rsquo;s a very sacred thing so sacred that you don&rsquo;t violate or try to push it. You know what they say &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t break a law of nature, you break yourself against it&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s how we learn the hard way. It that clear enough? Audience: So guessing that timing that is proper is more or less anticipating the events that are going to happen? Adano: I&rsquo;ll have to quote Sri Yukteswar, &ldquo;God is un-anticipatory, ever-new joy&rdquo; and though we may foretell our future conditions, it doesn&rsquo;t compel us to experience it. Therefore the stars may foretell but they don&rsquo;t compel and by this we learn now the deeper impact of timing on our lives, we have a freedom in timing. We don&rsquo;t exercise it because we don&rsquo;t know how to exercise it and the only time we can exercise this freedom is in a necessity. That&rsquo;s why the scriptural writings that the Eastern teachers would say &ldquo;All your needs are fulfilled,&rdquo; they didn&rsquo;t say all your wants are fulfilled. So life as a functional process is a necessity motivated synchronous organism comprising your cellular structure as the ultimate form of experience, do you get it now? That&rsquo;s why God cannot be competed with, He&rsquo;s unique in the sense that he became you but He will permit you and I and everyone in this room to have more and more of the potential to bring to the surface, we&rsquo;ll never run out of our potential. Audience: Then why is it that everybody isn&rsquo;t just absolutely frantic to find out how to do this? Adano: (Laughter). Some of us are like chicken eggs, some of us are like turtle eggs, some of us are like dinosaur eggs. Chicken eggs take 21 days to hatch, turtle eggs may take 90 days to hatch, and dinosaur eggs take 1000 years to hatch. (Laughter). It&rsquo;s the degree of toxicity to which each one of us are being exposed to that delays the synchronicity or recognition of it. So cleanliness is next to Godliness was a statement made, I just twisted a little to say &ldquo;Cleanliness IS Godliness,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not next to, it is. Because the more you clean up your mechanism, the more you synchronize with the Creative Principle and the obvious experience is no longer miraculous, it&rsquo;s the end result of everything falling into place for the first time which you should have done in the first place before you ever got toxic, you see? And we were non-toxic when we came into existence but we went off and then we lost our synchronicity so we come back to this by opportunity to repeat it. Nature provides the laws for its creation to go through. Audience: How long does it take? Are you suggesting a diet to cleanse? Adano: That&rsquo;s only one of the means of detoxifying the body, that&rsquo;s only one of the means. Even if you follow diet, remember you have to think first to eat incorrectly let alone to think to eat correctly. So again attitude comes back in terms of the action and cleaning up again you&rsquo;re not only going to clean up the physical action, you&rsquo;re going to clean up the thinking process too then you&rsquo;re going to try and look at the objective results. So it&rsquo;s not just something you&rsquo;re going to allow yourself to be subjected to and can&rsquo;t do anything, you have a way now to change the mental attitude, change the input or the output, and gradually bring it back into alignment. 1:10 The same way like a car, if we put so much trust in a vehicle to take us down the road with our lives at stake, like I flew in a plane today and I&rsquo;m looking at the metal there and I&rsquo;m thinking of the many brains that went to put this whole piece of machinery together and the whole conversation was chronicity or timing for each of these gadget to stay stable for the thing to fly but that isn&rsquo;t obvious until you relate. What is so obvious is the rotating of the fan and the seats all these things are obvious, the most important thing that should be obvious you don&rsquo;t see it but if one of those pieces of equipment be off time, what do we got? A nosedive, you see. So this if in a physical way is obvious to us then attitudinally, program-wise to the way we speak to ourselves is far more important to the realization of ourselves. All great teachers will tell you the same thing in their own way but when you break it down into a practical application and that&rsquo;s what you want now. We don&rsquo;t want to remain like children in kindergarten and not apply the law of life in practical ways otherwise we&rsquo;d be hurting ourselves and condemning one another and becoming very fanatical and in the end we&rsquo;ve missed the boat. It&rsquo;s when we start working with it and getting to the practical level of it, we start to see the commonality then we can go on without feeling guilty or threatened by the environment. The environment is here before us to offer us the opportunity to synchronize for the highest good but we can interfere or block that synchronicity by the attitude. That&rsquo;s how come one great man wrote this book called &ldquo;Positive Thinking&rdquo; but the thinking is the attitude necessary for the action and you have to think that you act and if you think and have to act then what is the basis of it? It&rsquo;s the rhythm or the synchronicity. Now you&rsquo;re a musician? Good. If you have four people playing with you and everyone plays in their own way, are you gonna have any music coming out? See what I mean? The same thing applies, we use the word spirituality, it&rsquo;s just another way of saying the spiraling force field of the cells and how to synchronize with that which is your DNA and RNA. They&rsquo;re set up like a helix inside of you so more and more our research world and its results are making us conscious minus guilt as the reality of our true spiritual nature. Not churchianistic or overly religious, no, those terms can put you in the wrong frame of experience. The spiritual person, I don&rsquo;t know if you all saw the picture of Gandhi, you know what he said? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hindu, I&rsquo;m a Jew, I&rsquo;m a Christian, above all I&rsquo;m a human being.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s more important, the emphasis on being. He didn&rsquo;t aspire to have any great qualities, he just wanted to live what is factually now and work with the timing of the period and spirituality is that. It&rsquo;s showing up all around us in many ways through the movies, through the different art forms that we didn&rsquo;t recognize before, now we are starting to relate and recognize it. It is becoming more and more obvious that all of us are good, don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. Remember one thing, you&rsquo;re born a winner, it could be worse. (Laughter). Audience: Now we&rsquo;re all going around detoxifying and trying to get synchronized and I&rsquo;ve read certain people or their vibrational patterns you come in contact with them, you&rsquo;ll pick up their patterns and so some Masters would say don&rsquo;t shake hands with anybody, don&rsquo;t touch anybody because you&rsquo;ll pick up their vibrations. I don&rsquo;t understand, what should we do? Adano: Yes, no, maybe. You see when you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, don&rsquo;t touch. It&rsquo;s like a child, he don&rsquo;t know a hot cup will burn their hands so you tell them don&rsquo;t touch but they&rsquo;ll push to find out and then scald themselves. And when you know what you&rsquo;re doing, you pick up a rag and take the cup off the stove and you don&rsquo;t burn your hands and maybe if you&rsquo;re pouring a hot stuff into the cup that is cold then you don&rsquo;t burn your hands either. It&rsquo;s a matter of knowing. It would be highly impractical to say don&rsquo;t touch anyone. If a person is dying there and another person comes along and says &ldquo;Oh boy, you&rsquo;re not Jewish like me or you&rsquo;re not Chinese like me, I can&rsquo;t touch you. You&rsquo;re not rich like me, I can&rsquo;t touch you.&rdquo; And another person walks in the room and says &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;d better call an ambulance and do something&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the story of the good Samaritan. It&rsquo;s to make you realize that we can carry the idea out of scope in terms of what is practical and human and what is more important is not that the person may be bad or they may not be the same peer group or rich like you, is that it&rsquo;s a human being and don&rsquo;t judge them from karma and don&rsquo;t judge them from heredity. Always look at them at the higher potential of God in them because that may be God&rsquo;s way to test you if you believe in a higher potential in your own self and the more humanistic you can generate contact, the more compassionate this force field will shoot up like a champagne out of you. But it needs that kind of a confrontation to trigger that&hellip; (gap in tape). Would you say the man who has to handle a deceased corpse is going to worry? Put on a pair of gloves and pack it away and when you look at your loved one that has passed away, when he was up and walking around you hug him. When he&rsquo;s lying there in a coffin, flat on his back for a long time and you&rsquo;re not going to (inaudible). It&rsquo;s comical you know, you can get locked into a lot of things, the most important thing is the heart. You see in my work I have to work with all kinds of sick people and I heard that before I ever got into therapy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch this person, don&rsquo;t touch that person&rdquo; and when you get into therapy, you don&rsquo;t have time to think that because the person may be going from good to worse as far as their health is concerned and you know it doesn&rsquo;t take long for them to stop breathing. If you can&rsquo;t help them to hold on to that breath and get some sense of focus simply because you don&rsquo;t want to touch them, it&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s very frustrating that you find yourself in a helpless state like that when you feel that you couldn&rsquo;t reach out and touch, even to just console the person in some way. A gesture or kindness could be all they needed to pull them out of it and that&rsquo;s why they say the good Samaritan story is a very good way to solve the feeling of touch or don&rsquo;t touch. 1:20 Why I point out that is there&rsquo;s a a story that goes like this, it has to do with devotion and touching is a devotional concept. There was a man who traveled from the States to India after World War 2 was over and he read a book on the Eastern teachings and he wanted to go and meet some living person who could tell him about these spiritual laws that are written about. And he respected the author because author happened to be a neighborhood friend of his in the same town he was born in, went to the same school but they never saw each other in India and so the author mentions these people in the East. So this man goes all the way to the East and travels from place to place and finally he arrives at a place they call an ashram or community and he meets a living teacher there, someone who&rsquo;s living there and talking about spiritual subjects. There was no difference about him, he was just ordinary dressed and he stayed there for a while and got initiated into the art of meditation then he left and came back to America. When he got home, this is what he told his wife, he said &ldquo;Honey I&rsquo;m a different man now. I no longer eat the meat and I no longer drink alcohol and I need time off to be silent in myself and I don&rsquo;t smoke no more.&rdquo; She looked at them and she said &ldquo;Honey don&rsquo;t make me into you, I like my nip, I like my little meat, I like my little cigarette. I&rsquo;ll cook your food in a clean pot, plate, and everything, everything will be meticulous, and nothing will have anything to do with mine&rdquo; and that was the agreement &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me into you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;daisy don&rsquo;t convert me into a rose.&rdquo; All right, this went on for many years and they lived happily together and one day the teacher came for a visit to this country and he invites the teacher to their home and he told the teacher what a great wife he has, that she would cook food for him without any meat or anything. The teacher said all right and they went to the house and it was lunchtime and they got to the table and there was the wife, cooked the food and their food was separate food and the teacher looked at her straight like that and as he sat down he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll initiate you.&rdquo; Now that blew this man&rsquo;s whole entire mind, here he for years been&hellip; and when he went to India he had to clean up his act and clean up his body before he could get initiated, be a vegetarian to some extent, and here she&rsquo;s been eating and nipping, puffing, and she&rsquo;s gonna be initiated right away. Well he did like that and he said the teacher waved his hand in front of her face and (inaudible), she had a double shot of champagne and she&rsquo;s gone flying and she&rsquo;s seeing all kind of colors and feeling wonderful experiences of joy. That evening the teacher is ready to retire and so his friend said &ldquo;Sir, can I ask you one question before you retire?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;How come you initiated her just like that right away, never seeing her, and me all the time in India back and forth over the years?&rdquo; Then the teacher said to him, these are the words he said, &ldquo;Your devotion is a devotion of the brain. Her devotion is a devotion of the heart.&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t say a devotion to what, it left the man to figure out what the teacher meant. &ldquo;Your devotion is a devotion of the brain. Her devotion is a devotion of the heart&rdquo; and then he tells me later on what the teacher meant, &ldquo;A devotion of the brain is I&rsquo;m too busy worrying what I should and what I should not do to please my teacher in order to live a spiritual life. Whereas my wife simply cooked the food and you&rsquo;re my husband and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo; (Inaudible), she&rsquo;s not going to offend her husband, he wants to eat no meat and don&rsquo;t drink no alcohol and no smoke so she just did it and that was doing it from her heart as a wife. She wasn&rsquo;t arguing questions why she should or should not, her devotion was simply doing the thing as she was asked. And he said then he realized now why when the teacher arrived and saw the two of them, who was really having the internal growth. So don&rsquo;t make your devotion one of the brain, to touch or not to touch, make it from the heart. That&rsquo;s where you come back again, &ldquo;The pure in heart sees God&rdquo; not the pure in brain sees God. (Laughter). You see the ancient people were very specific in their anatomy and their feelings in the anatomy because your brain will constantly analyze left and right side, what and why. The heart doesn&rsquo;t have that to do, it just does but it has a compensation, the brain has a compensation too in the analysis, it&rsquo;s not easily fooled. Therefore when the heart takes over after it&rsquo;s been convinced there&rsquo;s no shenanigans going on in the brain then the heart takes over. Whereas the other way the heart can be fooled but even so the heart will override its being self-fooled. That&rsquo;s a wonderful part of the heart, it can override its own self fooling, the brain cannot do that, it needs the heart to do that because once you&rsquo;re being fooled with your brain, you don&rsquo;t trust it no more, it takes a long time to generate the compassion but if you&rsquo;re fooled from the heart, you still will push again to ride above it and come out. The heart is designed to do that, to rise above a self betrayal more than the brain. It&rsquo;s the reservoir of the compassion. Audience: Can you say a few words about attitude since that story seems to be in some way also about attitude but what attitude should we try to develop or which ones do we have to be afraid or be careful of? Adano: Over monitoring yourself too much, that&rsquo;s the attitude you have to avoid, making it too much of a brain issue of doing things that are functional and rational to be practical about your spiritual nature. Your spiritual nature isn&rsquo;t something that you&rsquo;re trying to put on a shelf as a polished object, spiritual nature is a process of living moment to moment as practical as possible. Therefore you don&rsquo;t sum up or assess a true spiritual person by their miraculous abilities or their possessions or their logistical communication, you judge them from their ability to be practical in any situation, that&rsquo;s how you judge it. Their sense of practicality under every circumstance or situation that comes up and how simple and practical they can be at the same time, that&rsquo;s the real attitude you should be focused on, to keep it as simple and practical. The reason is that every law in nature after you start analyzing it and working with it, you see how simple it is, you just couldn&rsquo;t realize how you missed it and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking at and you&rsquo;re trying to maintain that. As one teacher told his student &ldquo;I rather you read a hundred books, investigate all there is, talk with all the people in the world before you attempt to sit down for 10 minutes to meditate&rdquo; because what you would do in the 10 minutes is so simple, you&rsquo;re not going to believe that&rsquo;s what you have to do. So he says &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you take all your time, go all the truth, and then when you&rsquo;re satisfied that it&rsquo;s a non-verbal experience, then you&rsquo;ll sit down and watch inside.&rdquo; 1:30 That&rsquo;s how come they use the term Jehovah Witness consciousness is witnessing life in motion in the organism and doesn&rsquo;t interfere or try to monitor it or try to direct it, it merely learns to recognize its rhythms and in the recognition of its rhythms, it will begin to experience the timing or what you say Divine Will, it will get up to move with it. That is exactly why they say the dance of life because once you sit down and you watch internally, you hear the internal music and music is the food&hellip; sonics, cellular sonics, feeds consciousness which is the food of the Soul. Consciousness must talk, that&rsquo;s language, it must resonate in order to be respected and it&rsquo;s a hard thing to admit that your big fat mouth is important among people. To remain silent is not so often looked upon as&hellip; and yet it&rsquo;s powerful enough to make people respect you when you don&rsquo;t talk but this sonics goes on in you and your consciousness is watching this internal rhythm, this constriction, this dilation that&rsquo;s occurring in you from breathing as you watch it. Then eventually there is no more right brain/left brain arguments, it&rsquo;s a witnessing and it&rsquo;s a synchronicity but it doesn&rsquo;t remain there. That&rsquo;s just like the grape being picked and squashed, it has to move on to the next level of wine fermenting and then fermenting to a higher quality like champagne. So sitting there and looking is not the end of it, you may suddenly get glimpses and you think you&rsquo;re psychic. Well you&rsquo;re entitled to that because that&rsquo;s the next level up but don&rsquo;t be trapped in it because Paul will tell you those are only the gifts of the Spirit, that&rsquo;s not the actual fruit of the Spirit yet. That can leave you, a blow on the head and you lose all your psychic capability but you&rsquo;re still going to be a humble person with a blow on your head or be egotistical about being hit on the head. So keep on watching inside and then the watching begins to recognize outward synchronicity which is timing which is learning to fit, everything falls into place. You move into the final stage and that&rsquo;s what they call the wisdom or understanding is the fruit of the Spirit. You understand now that this mechanism is unique and designed to exonerate you from all your guilt and express total compassion by timing which is God-realization. Any other question? Audience: Why is sitting in a fairly static position so important, sitting meditation? Adano: Well if you disengage from the beta level of your brain by looking inside when you&rsquo;re standing up, you&rsquo;re liable to fall over and hit your head and if you&rsquo;re lying flat on your back and you disengage somebody may walk in and think you&rsquo;re dead but if you&rsquo;re sitting there, they may say &ldquo;Oh, he might be snoozing or he may be practicing his weird techniques&rdquo; so they don&rsquo;t touch you, they don&rsquo;t bother you. So the Eastern man realized many people were carted away my mistake for lying on their back practicing meditation and those that fell over hit their head, you know you could be unconscious when you hit the ground. It&rsquo;s a very tricky state of the brain to withdraw from the beta level of active eye movement to a slow down rate of the alpha to watch without distraction which is the first level of verbally behavior. So sitting or kneeling this way you know for sure you&rsquo;re not going nowhere because you can&rsquo;t go that way, you see what I mean? (Laughter). At least they know you&rsquo;re praying but it&rsquo;s the fact that the person can be assumed to be in a state of death if they&rsquo;re flat on their back and they&rsquo;re not breathing because when you get into lower states of the brain, the respiratory rate diminishes to a level that the eyes can&rsquo;t recognize it and you need equipment to vouch. Well Yogananda had a teacher who one night was lying flat on his back and he walked in the room and he said &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; his teacher must be dead so he goes to get a mirror and put it under his nose to see if he&rsquo;s breathing and he don&rsquo;t get no reading and by that time, he&rsquo;s ready to call the undertaker. So the teacher opened his eyes and says &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to sleep? Stop worrying, get rid of your mosquito consciousness.&rdquo; You see mosquitoes were sitting on the teacher&rsquo;s body and not stinging the teacher but he was busy hitting at the mosquitoes and he wanted to wake up the teacher but the teacher was already in that deep state. So it can be very very tricky in the initial state so that&rsquo;s the reason why the precaution was the sit down or possibly kneel. Western man who got it from Jesus who knelt in the Garden of Gethsemane and did most of his meditation in the kneeling posture. Eastern man sat down but yet kneeling or prostrating also was found in the East, you find that in Tibet, they prostrate because it&rsquo;s one of the first respect to the Creator as the Earth. &ldquo;Who are thou o&rsquo; man to stand before the Creative Principle when the earth thou standest on is holy?&rdquo; So if the Earth you stand on is holy, you question yourself &ldquo;how can it be holy?&rdquo; It contains all the minerals that your body contains, it just happens to be at a different speed, yours is a tissue and that is the actual mineral you&rsquo;re looking at. The sense of respect for the connective unity would make you bow down but if you want to make it a little more realistic, you can look at it this way. &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness, God created He them and breathed into Man breath of life and Man became a living soil.&rdquo; (Laughter). Come let us make a manifestation with a dualistic polarity of plus and minus and infuse it with vitacity or energization and all forms became vital soil. 1:40 You&rsquo;re not saying any different from the principle, you&rsquo;re enhancing the principle without guilt. We are living soil but we can soil ourselves by being what? Tearing it down so meditation is a way to get back to all these inner understandings of yourself to free you from the fears and sitting is good, kneeling was original in the first place to make you appreciate the soil is sacred and you are soil, you are 144 elements: 12 basic and the rest are all trace minerals, you can&rsquo;t do without them. So like it or not we are forced to respect it and yet within the same apparent soil that can be dirty to the eye with the inherent vitacity, it becomes flesh and yet within the same form of flesh it has a quality not yet released, the non-decomposing quality of it. Every other form of life that comes from the soil decomposes or are soiled by their behavior and yet there is one form of life that continues to go on, that comes from the soil, and that is a caterpillar. He eats this way from the products around that feeds off the soil and then it spins the cocoon, shuts itself down like a meditation, and emerges like a butterfly, a new entire species that flies for the first time, no longer limited to the crawling on the soil, totally elevated off of it. Yet there is nothing more beautiful that flies to compare the butterfly. Look at all the things that fly and looks like one little butterfly, it&rsquo;s fantastic. Yet at the same time as much as it flies, you will never find a rotten butterfly but you&rsquo;ll find a rotten caterpillar or a rotten bird and you find rotten people too. It&rsquo;s the real one that don&rsquo;t rot is a glory to the God that is locked up in it in the apparent soil that didn&rsquo;t soil itself, it cleaned up its act, do you get the picture now? So sitting down is good, kneeling down came first, lying down is not too ideal and standing up is not too ideal because there can be problems in situations like that. Yet at the same time, you have to graduate to the posture that Man was designed for, the only posture and that is this, standing on his two feet, walking with the God in him. He&rsquo;s gotta graduate from sitting down, he has to graduate from groveling in the dirt, lying on his back to this posture: wide eyed open, carrying his Goddess in him. Not closing his eyes and walking around but he has to graduate there because that&rsquo;s the measurement of his God-ness, the measurement of his spirituality in the Now synchronizing with the demand on his mechanism. One can say Superman is no longer fictitious, the qualities are all there too but we are moving into that direction like it or not, it&rsquo;s locked up in yourself. Yes, you had a question there. Audience: I just wanted to say thank you for this opportunity of allowing us to share this experience and (inaudible). One question in meditation, when that door opens what is the focus of concentration (inaudible)? Adano: You&rsquo;ve got what they call &ldquo;signal,&rdquo; the five words that were given to you at initiation, that&rsquo;s like the SOS. Drowning in the world of words, you&rsquo;re sending out the signal that will pull you out so that that intelligence that pulls sonics together and commands light will suction you out of the verbal dialogue into the non-verbal level. So you have to use your call signals and you know you wouldn&rsquo;t dial a phone and ask for Adano and hang up before I answer, right? You wait until I say &ldquo;hello.&rdquo; And you say, &ldquo;Is that Adano?&rdquo; And I say &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; and then you start your conversation. That&rsquo;s the same way with that call signal inside, it&rsquo;s a call signal to the five levels of creation: the sonics, the gaseous, the temperature, the liquid, and the crystalline because you have to pass through these five to get beyond the sonic range into the non-sonic range which is what we say the non-verbal levels but you need that call signal to get you through. In other words it&rsquo;s like your Visa card or Mastercharge to get credit from that direction. If you somebody vouches for you at the store for your credit, those sounds freeze their brain from reliance on the verbal levels and then it suctions you, it opens the door from inside. There&rsquo;s no door that is opened from the outside. You see, &ldquo;Door of my heart, open wide I keep for you,&rdquo; it has to be from the inside then we enter it but we&rsquo;re allow to come back out because we are vouched for already so our return is already guaranteed. It&rsquo;s like my plane ticket is already paid for to go back, you see what I mean? You go in, you have a call signal to go into the non-verbal level and then you have a right to come back to the verbal level and function. So when you look into the door of consciousness to the light, you have the signals to send in that you go through. Because what is going through is a label, something someone called you. What did they call you when you&rsquo;re born, when they christened you? They didn&rsquo;t call you &ldquo;yeeaaaahhh.&rdquo; (Laughter). Isn&rsquo;t that the first sound you made? I heard a joke you know they say in China when you&rsquo;re born and they want to give you names, they take all the pots and pans in the kitchen, tie it with a string, throw it up in the air and it falls down, &ldquo;cam a lang a long,&rdquo; and that your name (laughter). So my friend War Eagle would say you&rsquo;ve got to wait until you&rsquo;re 30 years of age to go prove yourself and get a name. So all these things come up to a labeling after the fact so if we keep relating to that, it&rsquo;s not valid enough for the internal awareness of ourself. We only have one name and it never changes, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;me.&rdquo; You never lost that name and it never changes, &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s the true you and &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; I and the me are one and the same because you have to use the verbal sonics to emphasize the &ldquo;I&rdquo; to synchronize with the reservoir of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; where the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is projected out as a communication sonics. &ldquo;Me&rdquo; gives &ldquo;I&rdquo; opportunity to resonate from the open mouth and it can only be respected by the &ldquo;you&rdquo; that is &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the other person talking back to you. It&rsquo;s a comedy but these are the three words: the &ldquo;I, you, me&rdquo; game. 1:50 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on first, who&rsquo;s the second, and I don&rsquo;t know is on third,&rdquo; you know that story? That&rsquo;s the same kind of thing you have in conscious being but we are living it but we have to understand it and work with it. That takes away all the guilt and all the condemnations that you may generate from programming or incorrect programming. (Gap in tape). As you work more with the process of signaling to the door of consciousness to the light and you clean up the mechanism by the respiratory technique and free it from the feedback, you&rsquo;ll find the mechanism becomes more and more aligned with the timing. But at the same time there are moments when we feel challenged or confronted, when logic generates frustration and indecision, and that&rsquo;s where we can either be vulnerable to the ego craving to be out of time and be vulnerable because it may act out the time. But if it doesn&rsquo;t do that and it stays within its own time as it is set up to do then it will not put you in a vulnerable position. I&rsquo;ll give you an example, &ldquo;Father remove this cup,&rdquo; a statement made by Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane while meditating and foreseeing the crucifixion on the cross and the painful end of his life in the human frame. His ego could get the best part of him if he goes out of synchronicity, seeing it all within already, but then he realizes that could not be valid though it would be an escape or delay of the time, what is valid that the time is coming due that he may have to face the greatest test and if the test is set already, there are already compensations for every test. The Creative Intelligence does not test Itself without compensating Itself, It&rsquo;s not one of those kinds of a function. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a science and an art at the same time, it&rsquo;s a rewarding principle. &ldquo;Not my will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay, I know this is coming up, all I need now is the strength to go through it, stick it out to the end.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s going to be rough, I&rsquo;m not going to say it&rsquo;s easy, and that&rsquo;s how you don&rsquo;t allow the ego now to throw you off the timing and you will synchronize to the end each function, though it may be painful, yet it&rsquo;s not destructive enough to revert into the egoistic level, you see what I mean? And that&rsquo;s what they say &ldquo;It could be worse.&rdquo; Every step of the way always see what you got and say &ldquo;it could be worse.&rdquo; So even death may seem like death and it could be worse yet again when you triumph over the death, there you know you didn&rsquo;t revert to the egoistic level, you still kept the consciousness and that that synchronicity pulled you through. Basically that&rsquo;s the highest test we&rsquo;ll ever have in the form, the cocoon state of the caterpillar, the death state of the mechanism to shirk from the egoistic desire to avoid or work with it so that the ego don&rsquo;t take over and change the rhythm. (Gap in tape). Audience: How do you know when you&rsquo;re supposed to face the dragon and when you sidestep the dragon? Adano: Now that&rsquo;s a good question. Well the person who is not ready will know from within themselves that they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to face the dragon because they have never faced anything before and worked their way through it. You can&rsquo;t give up what you never experienced and you cannot encounter and work through conditions that you have never had any opportunity to rise above. You must have had or will have to have conditions thrown in your path to help you to arise or raise yourself above them. So until you&rsquo;re ready to face the dragon, you&rsquo;re going to be given little lizards to jump around, see what I mean? You&rsquo;re going to have precautionary or preparatory exposures to develop the quality of facing it. So sidestepping really wouldn&rsquo;t be any sidestepping, that would be the time spent in preparing to face the dragon. So when you look back on the many things that you overcame in your life and it didn&rsquo;t destroy you, your persistence to continue is what gives you the strength now to face to dragon. But the dragon is only proportionate to the degree of the immunity because every time it tests you, it is only trying to extract a higher level of your immunity for you. It is trying to get you stronger within yourself, it&rsquo;s trying to allow the greater qualities of your potential that you&rsquo;re unaware of to come to the surface. It isn&rsquo;t intending to destroy you, that&rsquo;s not its intent, its intent is to bring out the best in you at every level. It&rsquo;s just when you may not realize that and the ego gets the best part, then you may lose your synchronicity but otherwise you will find that if you go with it, as they say &ldquo;go with the flow&rdquo; instead of bucking it, you will adapt to the challenge and you&rsquo;ll go through. Like some people who want to take their basic training, when they&rsquo;re told to crawl through the barbed wire, they forgot to listen to the sergeant and kept their buttocks up too high. (Laughter). See that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about so you have to listen to the instructions too and go through the barbed wire. You&rsquo;ll get that sense of knowing from previous experiences of overcoming obstacles and that will give you your cue or clue to how to cope with every condition. In the first place you can&rsquo;t have a challenge if it&rsquo;s not in your karmic confrontations, I&rsquo;ll give an example. There was a young couple who met a teacher and they said to the teacher we got married many years ago and we would like to have children but we don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get any. We&rsquo;ve tried for a long time, no results, could you as our teacher bless us with the opportunity of having children? 2:00 The teacher listened, he looked all over the room, they wondered what the hell is was doing. Then he says &ldquo;I think your karma is over, I don&rsquo;t see any Soul waiting to come in to work out karma with you.&rdquo; That kind of freaked them out for a while, he doesn&rsquo;t see any Soul waiting to come out and work karma with them and so he says &ldquo;Maybe your karma is over with having children, maybe a healthy relationship with two people working and serving and being part of the community, may be your role&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re young people. &ldquo;Oh teacher, we&rsquo;re so young, that don&rsquo;t make us feel good, there must be something we can do.&rdquo; After awhile he looked around. &ldquo;If you are persistent, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll evolve a tree into the level of a human being for you but don&rsquo;t expect it to be more than a woodhead when it&rsquo;s born.&rdquo; Since there&rsquo;s none there waiting to work out karma in your mechanism and we all evolved from the tree already and the resins leached off the tree and then down into the water and mingled with sodium chloride in salt water, amoeba was formed, you see? So he would speed up this process so fast that the sperm may take form and the ovum and they&rsquo;ll be having a healthy child that is born, looks pleasing but don&rsquo;t expect it to be more than a wood-head because there&rsquo;s no karma. It didn&rsquo;t generate any karma to have to pay, it don&rsquo;t have any memory banks other than what? Being a tree see? So that&rsquo;s one of the problems of asking a teacher for something you may not need, they didn&rsquo;t have any confrontations to go through. So we don&rsquo;t really get conditions to face unless we&rsquo;ve got it already assigned to us or we have merited it. Now the same is true of the blind man that was healed by the man Jesus and they asked &ldquo;Who sin that the man is born blind?&rdquo; Did the the man sin to be born blind? If he did then that&rsquo;s past life, that&rsquo;s why he has the karma. If his parents sinned that he be born blind, that&rsquo;s heredity. &ldquo;I visit the sins of the the parents on the third and fourth generation.&rdquo; But then the man Jesus says &ldquo;Neither.&rdquo; Well if that&rsquo;s neither, what do we got? He&rsquo;s looking around and says &ldquo;Oh no, not from the past life, not from your parents,&rdquo; what have we got here? &ldquo;To the greater glory of God,&rdquo; that means the Soul of this man and I (Jesus), the present being, in this present body, came to demonstrate greater potential within your own nature to rise above your limitations. Don&rsquo;t shut yourself out, don&rsquo;t limit yourself, and sight is looking at things that you don&rsquo;t want to look at or refusing to look at or (gap in tape)&hellip; confrontation but greater strength in that man but (inaudible), he was healed of his blindness. So, but at the same time when he healed the man he did a peculiar act, it wasn&rsquo;t recognized to mean anything but the person who recorded it made a great issue of recording it. In order to heal the man when he was confronted by the people who wanted to know why the man was born blind or if the man inherited his blindness from his parents and he said &ldquo;neither,&rdquo; the way he healed this man was very very significant of telling these people they don&rsquo;t know what the heck they were talking about. I mean the way he healed him was like this, (Adano makes a spitting sound), he spit on the ground as a rebuking way to say to the public &ldquo;You are so limited in your thinking, you are so narrow-minded, you don&rsquo;t seem to want to go beyond the mere saliva of somebody who has a cough and spit it out. You&rsquo;re too busy projecting your oddities or toxicity.&rdquo; So he spits on the ground and picks it up and rolls it in a ball and then puts it on the blind man&rsquo;s (inaudible) to heal him. It&rsquo;s his way of rebuking them in their limitations just as much as they say &ldquo;Father I didn&rsquo;t have to say it in a loud voice, only because of the people.&rdquo; Many times he made gestures or comments to indicate we are selling ourselves short in terms of our problems and our confrontations and that we have to dig into ourselves to tap the deeper potentials. So when the dragon comes up, think back how many times you&rsquo;ve battled the lizards and then you know if you&rsquo;re ready for the dragon. Audience: Thank you. Adano: And there&rsquo;s another statement that will validate that, &ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t give you more than you can bear,&rdquo; right? Is that what he said? So it means you can&rsquo;t have a greater confrontation than you&rsquo;re competent or capable or have already developed immunity to or carry the potential capable of handling it. You&rsquo;ve got it in you, you&rsquo;ve got the quality, you pull it to the surface. Audience: And yet a good many people crack under stress or pain which seems to contradict that statement that sometimes the pain is too great. Adano: Yes no maybe. Yes they may crack under the pain and the stress because their ego is still out of synchronicity due to their toxicity, they haven&rsquo;t gained sufficient insight to learning to synchronize with life. They&rsquo;re maybe still pushing or wanting their own way and it has to be changed to suit them and they may be saying &ldquo;why me and why not somebody else, why should I suffer this.&rdquo; These are all maybe subliminally going on in their mind and then they may crack because they didn&rsquo;t make enough internal preparation to work with the laws of testing us. Audience: If we accept, everything is relatively easy. Adano: Yes that&rsquo;s why a friend of mine wrote the book years ago who lived in Canada, he was a sick man who injured his body. He was a doctor and he tried every means to heal himself even with all his colleagues and finally he came back to one statement &ldquo;I have to let go of all my intellectual training, all my colleagues good wishes and their methods of healing me and get down to the basics like a baby.&rdquo; And the book he wrote is called &ldquo;Let Go, Let God,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a very small little book but he was healed of his illness and he went around performing tremendous work getting people to come back to their basic humility of letting go, let God. So we do have to go with it and not fight it and the more we can let go and go with it, we find that we do ride the storm. Well all right there are case histories where the mere fact that the man kept laughing at the fact that he had cancer, he was cured, right? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous that I should suffer like this!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not preposterous &ldquo;why me Lord?&rdquo; Do you see the difference in the preposterousness of the attitude? One would say &ldquo;Why me&rdquo; and then cry for having it and the other one &ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous a thing like this happening to me! That&rsquo;s great, me of all people, I&rsquo;m glad to have the opportunity!&rdquo; And that kind of attitude is a correction than the other attitude of what? Feeling he is being put upon. In other words this man was happy to accept that he was being used. 2:10 So again, it&rsquo;s where you are inside. Audience: That&rsquo;s the quality that many of the Saints of all the different religions have had, it&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s how they got through it. Adano: That&rsquo;s exactly it. Have you ever read about Bernadette of Lourdes? The disease she had and when the sister superior who was over her found out what kind of disease she had, it really blew her mind, of trying to put her to work doing all the menial tasks and feeling that she was not trying to cooperate and when the doctor was called in when she fainted and examined her, they were told what type of disease she had? That sister became her sole friend, lifted her and moved her around. The pain that she was enduring was cancer of the bone and never complained and when the sister realized all of that that she had done to her, it made her open her heart more to her. But with all that Bernadette was above the pain in reference of helping others to rise above their pain, that was her tiger or her dragon, you see what I mean? Going through it and working with it, building up her own immunity and when she left the frame, there was no trace of cancer in the bone, that&rsquo;s the compensation. Creative Intelligence has to use us in many ways to show the deeper potential of the principal locked up in us, the butterfly locked up in the caterpillar, the Divinity locked up in the flesh. Audience: Her body is incorrupt too. Adano: Yes but the pain is the requisite of generating immunity, the cells have this locked into them, they can&rsquo;t develop immunity, they can&rsquo;t rise to a higher level of healthiness or their true nature unless they are challenged. Now here&rsquo;s a good example, if you&rsquo;re a manufacturer or product or an inventor of a product, how would you know the product is good until you do what to it? Put it through stress, test it right? Then if it holds up, then you have a working evaluation and that&rsquo;s exactly what Creative Intelligence has done by conditioning Himself into the form of flesh. He has to test Himself within this flesh form, His own divinity and potential if He has accomplished what He intended. You and I don&rsquo;t exist, we are only like little flames in a gas jet. If you look how gas jet is designed, there&rsquo;s only one flame that is really there, that&rsquo;s the pilot light, all the rest is just gas going through holes and yet we all think we&rsquo;re little individual lights all to ourselves. &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m in the world, I&rsquo;m the light of the world,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the pilot light, the rest of us is a bunch of hot air, that&rsquo;s the big fat ego. You see, that&rsquo;s the ego in us, the little one light flickering all over the place but essentially we&rsquo;re the unified gas where we draw from the one pilot light or true Me that is in all of us, that&rsquo;s your pilot light. &ldquo;Thou shall have no other God&rdquo; or not other light within the light that is in you, embody it, work with it. The Eastern countries, you see before Christianity came westward, the science of the Soul was an established science which is spirituality and all the terminology are found in the sayings of Jesus and down through Buddha, Krishna, right on to Jesus and the lost years of Jesus was spent in the Eastern countries. There&rsquo;s even evidence now in the scrolls that they have found and his actual name was Issad and it&rsquo;s recorded that he did go to these places and studied and then finally returned back home and his mission of conveying the knowledge that these men kept to themselves in that part of the world is like everything else, after a certain level of growth, isolationism or seclusionism or rigidity starts setting in and then the layman who cannot afford is often left out in the search for truth and only those who can afford to sustain the religious teachers are the ones that have access to the truth. Therefore periodically men who realize themselves would break away from that conformity and go back to the layman and try to arouse him to his true potential and that&rsquo;s how come through the East we find that Jesus ended up preaching not to the rich or to the intellectual, it was mostly to the layman. They call them sinners and publicans so they&rsquo;re the ones that needed the awakening to their inner potential because they were already becoming traumatized and depressed with their position and the intellectual groups had already made it so rigid in context, it really lost its true importance. So over the years you&rsquo;ll find that each one of us comes into his own awakening and the advent of the mechanical equipment that allows us to see into the structure of matter is the actual quantum leap for Man to live his churchianity and move on to his true Divinity by spirituality. But churchianity is necessary like kindergarden for us as we grow up but we all can&rsquo;t live and remaining in kindergarten, we got to go on to high school or college or university, we got to keep on going. So the awakening process is becoming more and more obvious and the practicality is making itself felt in our daily living. Audience: I&rsquo;ve got to go to bed. Thank you. Adano: Good night.</p>
<h2 id="1983-july-27---flagstaff-questions-and-answers">1983 July 27 - Flagstaff Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_27FlagstaffQandAQ2NW3 - Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s not a school, it&rsquo;s a clinic where we do holistic therapy for people who have problems and have tried every other form of therapy and then they come to us. We don&rsquo;t go out to try to heal people. The questions come up, &ldquo;Have you tried the the regular medical profession first? Have you gone to all the required modalities?&rdquo; And if they have tried them and there is no correction, we offer an opportunity to see if we can make you look at it more objectively and if in doing that it is corrected, that&rsquo;s how we operate. Audience: Are you teaching? Adano: No. Well let&rsquo;s say for instance a person calls on the phone and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak to Adano.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have an ache in my back.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;How long have you had it? Have you been to regular professional doctors and checked it out?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes. They don&rsquo;t find anything wrong, all they say is there&rsquo;s nothing actually physically wrong there. Yet the pain is there, it keeps repeating itself, and I am unable to perform my work.&rdquo; Then I would say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything for you over the phone, if you wanna come I will check it out and if we can&rsquo;t do anything for you, we&rsquo;ll try and recommend who would be the proper or competent person to help you in it.&rdquo; So they show up then we check them out. Nine times out of ten, it is corrected but one out of ten, they have to be referred to other competent people to do it. But nine times out of 10, they do have a recession in the problem and they&rsquo;re able to cope with it and correct it and it phases out. And once a month, on the last Sunday of the month when I&rsquo;m there we have a workshop in nutrition, how to eat properly. See if you don&rsquo;t know how to eat properly, you can get sick and most of our illnesses begin from improper eating. You see that&rsquo;s one of the indications in your biblical writings when Man was made, what would he eat? And so he was told what to eat but never brought forward into a workable science and so many of the people that show up at the clinic usually have a lot of problems that are related to nutrition more so than injuries and then they have to be shown how to reassess their diet and then they get well. Audience: I want to find out if you&rsquo;re giving workshops or retreats? Adano: No, the retreat was for these folks here but usually I just have the clinic and we have the workshop on nutrition on the last Sunday of the month. It&rsquo;s mostly a preventative process. Audience: I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the inner library that you talked about, how to get to the inner library or understand? Adano: The Akashic records or the cohesive memory bank of the intercellular mechanism can be tapped when you slow the brain down to about 12 cycles a second. Normally anything above 25 is considered the beta level, when you lower it down below 25, you enter the alpha but you really can&rsquo;t tap the memory bank at that level, it&rsquo;s a little too fast. Memory precipitation begins anything from 12 down to four. Now very few people can drop the 12 and those who can drop the 12 begins to tap the memory bank. Now the breathing will drop down, that&rsquo;s why one of the handicaps of meditation is that you&rsquo;re busy arguing with yourself and wondering if you&rsquo;re not breathing fast or you&rsquo;re breathing too slow, this dialogue interferes. There&rsquo;s a very good reason why it&rsquo;s there, your toxicity ratio may be the impedance for you to lower and if you drop too fast, you may disturb some of the transport time of the minerals in your body to certain organs and therefore you may go into a spasm. Now it could be speeded up like at a Pentecostal movement, you go from 30 cycles down right to about seven cycles very fast and they push you over and you&rsquo;re, what do they say? Zapped by God, by the Holy Spirit, you fall right over and you&rsquo;re in that state but your whole memory bank comes crashing in on you and time stands still, verbalization stands still, and it&rsquo;s all photography. But you have a problem trying to pick up the pieces and yet it&rsquo;s an enlightenment and the concentrated fluids in the body that are so highly refrigerated and suppressed by the different images over the years of anguish come gurgitating out like a volcano. And you start crying, you can&rsquo;t hold back this and sometimes they have to haul you out and keep you in a corner and try to get you to get back. But that&rsquo;s very drastic in terms of the meditative life but it&rsquo;s valid in terms of that it does exist. Going into it objectively bit by bit under your own control, it takes a little time to get down to that level but when you get to that level, you will start opening up as you gain more control. It&rsquo;s a whole lot better to go down slower and gain control than to be thrown into it that fast and then you don&rsquo;t have control. It&rsquo;s like a person dropping into the water to swim and goes to certain depths. He&rsquo;ll go down but he can&rsquo;t come up fast. If he comes too fast up, he&rsquo;ll get the bends and that&rsquo;s reversed now in terms of what is in meditation. If you try to drop yourself down too fast, you get the psychological bends, you see what I mean? So you have to know what you&rsquo;re doing. So you don&rsquo;t wanna go down too fast, then as you gradually work your way down, then you will able to come back up progressively. And the important thing to remember that when you&rsquo;re slowing down, if you don&rsquo;t have any way to relate to any human being as a touch base, it&rsquo;s like we say an anchor to a boat, then have something in reference to what you wanna do after you finish your meditation. If you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna meditate for the next hour and try to go down to that level and after that hour, I&rsquo;m gonna go out and do some and such a work,&rdquo; that built in program is a safety factor to a locking in of yourself in a range that you may not be competent in and it will fire you back out. So this is your own safety factor, it&rsquo;s how you program back in yourself to come back on a conscious level. So always be certain that if you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna meditate, I&rsquo;m gonna get up and do this and that,&rdquo; but do it when you get up, don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fail to do it because then it&rsquo;ll trick you and knock you out and let you down. That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll learn sooner or later that you have to live your word. 0:10 So don&rsquo;t make statements about yourself, what you will do after meditation and don&rsquo;t do it. You can try your best to do it and finish it then the consciousness will take over and fulfill and will allow you to slip down into that level. Mr. Casey used to do that a lot, he would lie on a book and all of that data from the book would be in his brain. But then he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna use this to do my work&rdquo; because if he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d get locked into it. Audience: I find when I get to that point where you stop the inner dialogue, the problem becomes I immediately say to myself, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s stopped.&rdquo; (Laughter). Adano: Guilty! You got company. Audience: I thought maybe there would be some suggestion of how you might wedge yourself in there and keep yourself more quiet, quite longer. I know that that may be the process of a lifetime. What I find is that it&rsquo;s almost as though at this point in my life,I partly become afraid of that silence or this uncomfortableness and I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I could do to not talk to myself about how quiet I&rsquo;m being. Adano: Well, from my own experiences and all the other researchers including doctor Lilly in his latest book &ldquo;The Eye of the Cyclone,&rdquo; you must make the necessary verbal programs for what you expect to do after you proceed to experiment on the inner level. You must have something to refer back as an anchoring system. No captain will take to sea without an anchor on his boat and when he comes into the shoreline, that anchor has to be there to hold (inaudible). So there are certain terms or ideas that we have to anchor into and that is where desire to perform service is a natural and a rational anchoring for the brain after researching into the self. You must set up some desire to perform some type of service that is natural to your mechanism, then this will suspend that, &ldquo;I am silent now.&rdquo; Because that is what the brain was looking for in the first place, what would you do if you get all this silence and then where are you going to apply it? You see what I mean? So if you program that you will apply your attention to something constructive after you go in that state and the ideas to make whatever you go to apply yourself to will flow easier in the process of application, you will see there is a definite link now for the first time by setting up the programming. For instance, alright you just spent an hour or whatever the length of time to come to a suspension of the dialogue but before you started, you said to yourself, &ldquo;I am going to go into my consciousness to tap possible new ideas how to work on this piece of equipment or this particular problem in my daily life and I want to get in there to have access to that reservoir of information and it flows in rational, logical when I come out in the application.&rdquo; You have to do that so then you shut off and you go in and you sit and you wait for the internal dialogue to shut down then the creative nature will come up. Now if the experience for that particular need is to occur within that specific day or time, it will come up very fast. If the experience does not occur but let&rsquo;s say in a week from now, it will give you portions of it, pushing you into a whole week to finalize the experience, you follow what I&rsquo;m saying? The data will not come flowing through ahead of its time. You may get a preview of what is possible but it will not come up, you progressively will get portions of it coming up for you to come with what you&rsquo;re doing on the rational level. Therefore you have control now for the first time that you can actually relate back inside and say, &ldquo;I am now going to bring this forward out of my consciousness and apply it.&rdquo; But you must set up something to do otherwise you&rsquo;re tapping the reservoir without any purpose. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going to your savings account to use it and there is no bill to pay. Now if you have a check in account and there was a deficiency in the checking account because you pay out a check and the check is going to be short, you can draw from your savings to fulfill the deficiency of the checking account. But something has to be missing in order for the other one to be valid for it to be released and if you do that outwardly, the same is going to go on inwardly because our outward behavior is only a reflection of the internal mechanics and the two can&rsquo;t be in conflict. It makes you more aware of how you&rsquo;re set up. So if you&rsquo;re going to create a demand and place a locking in to the supply area, which is the internal portion of your mechanism, you have to set up a demand for it to be able to feed from that level to what you need to apply. But you can&rsquo;t just say I&rsquo;m gonna go in there and then when you get there there&rsquo;s nothing for it to do then naturally it&rsquo;s gonna confront you and say &ldquo;why you got me in here for?&rdquo; Audience: I wanted to ask you also, I have a isolation thing and I do use it for meditation and I was interest in your comments about it being an inappropriate way to begin meditation and wonder when it might become appropriate or if that&rsquo;s a different situation altogether? Adano: No, as long as you set up a demand of what you will do with the energy after you tap it and what is necessary to perform that demand, that is a valid way to program yourself. You must set up the demand. You see necessity or demand is the mother or origin or the required condition for inventiveness or creativeness. You couldn&rsquo;t draw from the source or reservoir if there is no demand, what would you do with it? It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t have any bills to pay, would you take out your money to do what? You&rsquo;re only gonna draw it out when there is something to pay, otherwise you leave it there to accrue and that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re doing with the mechanism. That&rsquo;s why a lot of doctors will tell you, you&rsquo;re only using a very small portion of your brain potential. We don&rsquo;t have demand levels sufficient enough to keep pulling upon the brain potential, we have to generate demand levels. So meditation is the opportunity to go in, assess the account, assess the reservoir, and at the same time recognize the demand level. Now I&rsquo;ll give you an example in the comment I made earlier about this hotel in reference to Yogananda and the Cadillac. He was in a brand new Cadillac, that year&rsquo;s model, and yet the man was saying in his mind, &ldquo;How come if he&rsquo;s such a spiritual person, why is he driving in Cadillac?&rdquo; And he turns around and addresses the man by saying, &ldquo;Mister Johnson, I didn&rsquo;t ask for the Cadillac, it was given to me.&rdquo; And then he makes the comment, &ldquo;In fact, it&rsquo;s a very poor expression of man&rsquo;s creativity, looking forward to a better model next year.&rdquo; By virtue of this, he laid the groundwork for what? Creativity to flow to whoever is on the intake or to lock in, to have a design or an idea flow up to that brain. 0:20 So the person who was instrumental in giving him the vehicle would also be the recipient of this energy flowing back to them as a way to let them be more inventive. This is true of Jesus when he said &ldquo;The things I do, you do also.&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t say, not greater than I, and not more or less. He&rsquo;s already saying, &ldquo;The things I do, you do also,&rdquo; but then he goes on &ldquo;and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; What is that laying the foundation for? That&rsquo;s laying the foundation for more demand on the creative nature in us. It&rsquo;s like an anchorage for outlet. You have to set it up, otherwise it would not work. You have access to this reservoir but if you don&rsquo;t set up what the demand is for, it&rsquo;s not gonna release it. Once you realize that, then it will come forward quicker but until you realize that, you always shut it off by the statement, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m no longer talking, what happens next?&rdquo; You see the expectancy hasn&rsquo;t been resolved, you have to set up something to resolve expectancy then it is automatically supplying you with data. Audience: What are your views on reincarnation? Adano: It&rsquo;s valid, it would be highly impossible to create a universe and not have opportunity to resolve your mistakes. Now, let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re endowed with the power to command anything you want to eat to appear and so you command a tomato to appear and you plant it in the ground because you would like to eat another one. But by the same token, instead of another tomato coming up, a squash came up. You would call your friend and you say &ldquo;This is a fantastic thing, this is the greatest miracle, I planted a tomato and I got a squash.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll all agree with you. Yet, if you eat the squash, there is no more squash to be had. If you plant the squash and corn came up, now you&rsquo;re in a quandary, you don&rsquo;t have any squash to eat and you can&rsquo;t vouch that you had a squash. Now you see, it will be impractical for Creative Intelligence to work through such a law of surprise element without recurrence. Recurrence would be a functional law that if you plant the tomato, you&rsquo;re gonna get a tomato but to plant the tomato and get a squash and then you can&rsquo;t eat the squash because there&rsquo;ll be no more squash to plant, it leaves you in a quandary. So reincarnation is only a natural law of nature from the atomic level right down to the cellular level for cleansing the process of organisms that may delay their internal accomplishments. Now for instance let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re born and you make a lot of mistakes and some mistakes you don&rsquo;t make, so in in total of your life, sixty or seventy years, you may have had 15 non-corrected mistakes. But life terminates for you for sixty five, you don&rsquo;t have a chance to correct or make up for those 15 or 16 mistakes. All the others have been corrected so far and here you pass on not correcting that mistake. The account can&rsquo;t be closed, if in a physical rational way, you wouldn&rsquo;t do that to somebody who owes the company money, they&rsquo;re gonna send what? A bill collector to their heirs, right? To collect the the bill. Since the heirs are your own Soul nature, you will have to come back in some physical form to compensate for that bill and Eastern people have karma, the farmer calls that the sowing or reaping and Newton would call it &ldquo;for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&rdquo; Now, it&rsquo;s valid in this sense that you do something and if you don&rsquo;t complete it, you have to complete it at some other time. Now, if any reference to such an idea doesn&rsquo;t exist in other parts of scriptural writings or in other belief systems and if you look at physics from its own structure and this phenomena of repetition and self correction is not inherent in repetition, then reincarnation is invalid. The word reincarnation means merely to do it over again and correct it. Now, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; Is this your first 100,000,000 time? I once met a great Swami that came from India and this is how he greeted me when he walked into the room. &ldquo;Hi, brother of a 150,000 incarnations.&rdquo; And everybody looked but he recognized me as a brother of his over a 150,000 incarnations. Now that kind of blew a lot of people&rsquo;s mind out of focus because here is a realized man who was able to look at me straight off and we&rsquo;re meeting for the first time and making the comment, you see? Alright, let&rsquo;s take the story of Cain and Abel. Adam and Eve had a child called Cain and another child called Abel and it is said that the one brother killed the other brother. Now let&rsquo;s picture for one moment that there are only four people living, where is the justice of the dead brother going to be resolved because the other brother killed him? Where is he going to get a chance to come back and face him and say &ldquo;Hey, why did you do that to me?&rdquo; Now it said in the writings &ldquo;No man lay a hand on Cain, justice is mine saith the Lord.&rdquo; In other words, Adam and Eve even if they hire somebody or got vindictive enough to clobber Cain on his head, they don&rsquo;t have a right to perform the justice to satisfy Abel who has been hurt. Where is Abel going to have a chance to resolve or be absolved from this injustice? And where is Cain going to have a chance to face his mislead unless there&rsquo;s extended time. And extended time may not be just one body because now Cain is dead, Abel is dead, they&rsquo;re not going to meet up. Abel died before Cain, where are they gonna meet up? There&rsquo;s no justice now, everybody went scot free. Cain gone off when he passed away. Abel died, nobody made any justification for his death, doesn&rsquo;t sound valid. Yet, Creative Intelligence shows that there is a validity by extending into life repetition of correction. Now let&rsquo;s take another example. Cain will have to come back and Abel will have to come back to resolve their conflict, that&rsquo;s the extension of life. We have another example where there was a blind man. They brought him and they who brought him were various wonderful smart people, very intellectually trained and they&rsquo;re going to trap this highly realized teacher by the name of Jesus. And they brought this blind man and says, &ldquo;Tell us, who sinned that this man be born blind? Did the man actually sinned that he be born blind? Or his parents sinned that he be born blind?&rdquo; Now if the man sinned that he was born blind, where the hell can he go and sin first and be born blind? Do you see? How can he sin before he&rsquo;s born blind? Where did he live to perform something that was bad that he has blindness as a result and now has to be born blind? It don&rsquo;t make sense. Or if his parents sinned that he&rsquo;s born blind, then there&rsquo;s no judgment for that, &ldquo;I will visit the sins of the parents on the third and fourth generation,&rdquo; heredity will take its toll. 0:30 Now, if they said the parents sinned that the man be born blind, that&rsquo;s a way out for the man and it&rsquo;s a way out for reincarnation too because that would be heredity. But if the man sinned that he&rsquo;s born blind, where did he sin? And how did he live before to be born blind? What kind of function is this in nature? Or where is it gonna be compensated? Then the realized man has to answer. If he really knows his laws of reality and he cannot break a law, he has to put everything in the proper context and the answer is very valid, very scientific, and very in-depth. Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; none of the two are responsible for this man being blind. He didn&rsquo;t say that his previous life did not exist. It doesn&rsquo;t say that the parents actions were not valid, he said neither of these two is the cause that the man is blind. &ldquo;But this is unto the glory of God.&rdquo; This blindness you see here is a challenge to that Soul nature inherent in that form, if it&rsquo;s going to sell itself short of its creativeness and divinity and merely subject itself to repetitious behavior or inherited characteristics and never attempt to discover its true potential. But how is this true potential gonna have a chance to come to the surface if no other person never recognize it in them? Or enunciate it in them or point it out, it&rsquo;s not gonna have a chance. And by this, the way he heals the man is indicative that he knew more of the reality and the higher potential of the man. And what he did was simply this, he spit on the ground as a sign to say how foolish you people are in your ignorance, still trying to pinpoint one aspect of God and leaving out other aspects. And that doesn&rsquo;t say one aspect is more important or less important, there&rsquo;s more in us that we don&rsquo;t realize we have to go deeper yet. And then he rolls the spittle in a ball and puts it on the blind man&rsquo;s eye and the blind man gets well. One can say he sanctify dirt to heal dirt. This is dirt you know, 144 minerals, living dirt, holy dirt. Love it (Adano kisses himself). And the ground you walk upon is what? Holy dirt. Remove your shoes too. Get a deeper understanding of your true nature now not to sell yourself short. Good. That made them realize there was more to themselves and that they can now not be hampered by harping on the idea of past life as they drag out for all the problems that are facing them or the heredity patterns of parents, that they owe it to themselves to encounter and bring to the surface their own true spiritual potential and the way in was meditation. That doesn&rsquo;t say that reincarnation is not valid, it simply says, don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the only way to solve all the problems or that it&rsquo;s a condemnation for us to pay for our problems, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s existing as a law of encounter and resolution to a certain level of thinking, just as much as heredity exists to a certain level of thinking. But to the higher potential of your true nature, the Clark Kent that becomes the Superman by going behind the telephone booth, is what you have to uncover in you. Do you follow what I&rsquo;m saying? You&rsquo;ve got to go inside and pull off this facade of a mechanism, this verbalization, this impregnated thinking about what you think you are or what they told you you&rsquo;re supposed to be and release your internal qualities.

<h2 id="1983-july-28-part-1---flagstaff-spiritual-life">1983 July 28 Part 1 - Flagstaff Spiritual Life</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_28_1FlagstaffSpiritualLifeQ2NW3 - Audience: I&rsquo;ll say the same thing I said last night, we are simply a few Flagstaff residents who are seriously interested in prayer and meditation and their application to our everyday lives. We are not cult members. We come from a variety of professions in education, business, finance, the arts, science and technology, different levels of federal state and county government are represented among us. We have no formal structure or affiliation. In whenever we decide to to this, we all just get together and do it. However, we have been meditating together for about 10 years now and periodically we like to call an expert on meditation. This helps us to review and renew our spiritual goals in a practical way. It is our earnest hope and desire that tonight&rsquo;s lecture will enrich the personal lives of everyone present. (Inaudible then another speaker). Welcome friends, our speaker this evening was born in British Guiana, his father was Mongolian Chinese and a Buddhist and his mother Carob Indian and Spanish and a Roman Catholic. Reverend Ley&rsquo;s heritage then is a blend of two respected religious traditions. When Reverend Ley first came to the United States, he went to New York where he made his living working for a corporation. Later he lived in Canada, while in Canada he became affiliated with the Self-Realization Fellowship and taught Yoga. For those of you who are not familiar with the term Yoga, I might give you the definition from Webster&rsquo;s dictionary which says &ldquo;it is a practice involving intense and complete concentration on something, especially the Deity, in order to establish the identity of consciousness with the object of concentration.&rdquo; Usually it involves some certain postures and breathing is very important. So Reverend Ley taught Yoga and meditation classes for several years under the guidance of Paramahansa Yogananda. In 1969, while attending an East/West conference at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Reverend Ley met Swami Anand Saraswati of New Delhi India who had been one of Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s close aides in the movement for India&rsquo;s independence. The Saraswati is an ancient Yogic order and its name indicates a spiritual path through knowledge and wisdom. Adano Ley was initiated into the Saraswati order and given the title of Swami Nityananda and again for those of you who are not too familiar with the term &ldquo;Swami&rdquo; is a Hindu title of respect for a religious teacher. In Western religion we just say Reverend. Reverend Ley had spent five years in solitary yogic retreat in California before receiving this honor and while continuing his work and teaching in Yoga and metaphysics, as well as lecturing around the country, Reverend Ley also acquired an ND degree and is a licensed Naturopathic physician. Reverend Ley now lives in Houston Texas where he directs his own clinic, a center for holistic preventative therapy and instruction in self-transformation techniques. Many of us yearn for a greater sense of peace in our lives but this is not an easy thing to achieve as we go about our daily task of earning a living and sometimes dealing with irate customers and disgruntled clients and things of that nature. The attainment of peace through the practice of meditation is one of the things that Reverend Ley teaches. I believe that Reverend Ley conveys the feeling of peace. The subject of tonight&rsquo;s teaching is &ldquo;Is the spiritual life a science or a philosophy?&rdquo; It is indeed a great pleasure to present Reverend Adano Ley. (Applause). Adano: Thank you. Good evening friends. I want to make one comment of this building because years ago when I came into this area and I had my first indoctrination into Native American healing techniques and religious concepts, it was a building shaped like this that we call a Kiva and now I&rsquo;m coming back and when I spoke to my blood brother this morning he says &ldquo;You&rsquo;re back home.&rdquo; So all these are very significant to me and I&rsquo;m glad to be able to convey tonight what spirituality is. The question is is it a science or a philosophy? Well a philosophy can leave you in nebulous regions of thinking but not necessarily get down to the nitty-gritty of practical everyday living and measuring it. So often we make statements in philosophy and then we regret it because we can demonstrate it. Now when you look at science, science is very specific, sometimes it get to be dogmatic too but science has a value in this respect, science always uses definite facts that can be applied any place, at any time, to produce a desired result. Any type of information that will conform to that formula, will be classified as science. A compilation of facts that can be applied any place, any time, and get the desired result, you have science. Now spirituality would have to conform to this formula, otherwise we can discard it and say &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t match, really it&rsquo;s a philosophy.&rdquo; So tonight we&rsquo;ll try and see if we can apply or focus on facts about spirituality and apply them in the place and the time to get the results. Number one, in spirituality you have to work with your body, think of that, this human body, it&rsquo;s yours. All right let&rsquo;s find out one fact about it that is valid, that we can label and say &ldquo;this can be measured every time.&rdquo; Fact number one, losers can&rsquo;t be born. The sperm that got to the ovum, was it a loser or a winner? It was the winner, otherwise somebody would be in your place so there we have fact number one. 0:10 Anytime, any place somebody gets pregnant you know a winner is going to be born but that doesn&rsquo;t say that the winner can&rsquo;t be a loser by the environmental programming. The winner can be programmed to think he&rsquo;s a loser and end up losing but he is the winner by the mere fact he&rsquo;s born. Now remember that, that doesn&rsquo;t turn off in you, you can turn it down but you can&rsquo;t turn it off. That&rsquo;s another fact about yourself, you can turn down the winning-ness in you but you can&rsquo;t turn it off in you because the power that gave you the opportunity to be the winner is the driving force of your existence, you call it the Creative Principle. It&rsquo;s inherent in you, you cannot turn it off but you can turn down. Your willpower and your ego can turn it down but they cannot turn it off. The reason why they can&rsquo;t turn it off is a fact based on the principle of hearing, you are a hearing mechanism, you&rsquo;re a mechanism that hears and the sense of hearing cannot be turned off even after you&rsquo;re dead. You may not like it but that is a fact, otherwise no medium will call you back. If you remember Saul when he went to see the Witch of Endor in disguise and when the witch called on Samuel the prophet, Samuel rebuked Saul for calling him out from the grave. He didn&rsquo;t come to see Saul, he came to call him out. So mediums know they really have to call beings out of the invisible realm in order to make contact but then they can be seen also after they called up. So hearing, fact number two is not turned off. Number three, the moment you&rsquo;re born you make a sound (Adano makes a crying sound), it doesn&rsquo;t care what sex you are or what nationality you are, we all say the same thing, a very common fact, a common expression, and if you look at the mouth of the baby or the child that is crying, it will only expand out. But it cannot expand out like that to cry if it doesn&rsquo;t take the oxygen in and have the cord severed so inhalation and then &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; is out. That very motion of crying is nature&rsquo;s first indication that the organism, like your car out there, is turned on and the carbon dioxide is being filtered out and oxygen is going in through the cellular carburetor now known as your nostrils and your mouth. See these are facts you, can&rsquo;t eradicate them, you have to work with them. Then the mother notices a strange thing, the child does like this (Adano makes a gesture), that is telling the mother it is hungry. Of all the functions in the body, it wants to eat right away and you know it eats by nursing from the mother but like this (Adano makes a gesture). It doesn&rsquo;t open its eyes to see what it is eating, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s in a state of ecstasy and the parent is very happy. Leave the child by itself and go off and do something and should it wake up, it may cry to tell you it&rsquo;s awake but it will satisfy itself by reaching for something to put back in its mouth. Parents then have to be very careful not to leave objects around or ends up in the baby&rsquo;s tummy and then you have more problems now. Here we see a very important behavior regardless of sex, a function that the organism is reaching out to do, learn by eating. Well according to my teacher he would say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good Adano, you need 30 years of that kind of living to muck it up so don&rsquo;t get excited or don&rsquo;t try to change it for nobody, let them muck up for 30 years.&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s how you know it&rsquo;s going to be a science now and not a philosophy because they have a cluttered up toxic mechanism to correctly, to clean up and until they have that to work with, they&rsquo;re not going to believe a single word about it being a science. They&rsquo;ll all think you&rsquo;re a weirdo or a philosopher try to convert them but let them muck it up, clog it up, then they&rsquo;ll want to change. Well I hate to say the truth applies to me too, (inaudible), I used to weigh 180 pounds. I used to eat a nice good old-fashioned New York diet but that is necessary to learn. Don&rsquo;t try to change people because you can&rsquo;t change them, you can only change yourself. When the body is toxic and it gets toxic first by putting something in but you notice your parents will tell you and they have a responsibility to you for 18 years according to the law and that&rsquo;s their responsibility to see that what you put in keeps you healthy according to the requirements of the school or the environment and that you don&rsquo;t muck it up too much because it&rsquo;s very expensive, especially when you&rsquo;ve got to go to the doctor for new teeth or different parts of your anatomy, it&rsquo;s a very very expensive type of a program. So they watch you for 18 years to see you organize your life but you may not like it and I don&rsquo;t blame you either but that&rsquo;s the period you have to learn to experience confirmation, restriction, and persistency. You may not use it right away, it may be imposed upon you to set up certain behavioral functions in your mechanism. It is when you clog it up and then have to clean it up, you&rsquo;re gonna find out those disciplines are gonna come in handy but you don&rsquo;t know that until you mess it up. Now this body is what you have to work with, you can be programmed with a whole spectrum of ideas about what it is or what it is not, what to do and what not to do. Well until you get sick, you really don&rsquo;t know what to do and you find yourself very helpless and you may reach out for the closest tranquilizer which is valid enough to be there because that&rsquo;s part of the programming, you got to make mistakes and learn too. You may put a lot of tranquilizing products into yourself but still not correct the problem. Then you&rsquo;re going to get bored and angry and you&rsquo;re going to look up at the sky and shake your fist, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your fault!&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s good too because you&rsquo;re getting ready now to look at yourself objectively, not to look at yourself from a religious context be it a Buddhist or a Christian or Islam but you&rsquo;re getting ready to look at yourself objectively, &ldquo;Is there any valid use for me cleaning up myself? Is there any real reason for me to get healthy? Is there any real reason for me to want to find out what makes me tick? I can be inspired by the lives of great men, I can be inspired by the corrections of the different illnesses by people who pray but yet I may pray and not get more results, am I left out? Am I singled out never to get cured? Maybe my time ain&rsquo;t come yet to be hatched out like eggs you know.&rdquo; 0:20 So cleaning up again is another fact of time. So timing now is one of the facts about the spiritual science. when is it the time to do it and when is it not the time to do it. The brain is exposed to a great deal of data, people teach you a lot of things to do to survive and to remember in order to get through to get an education and yet somehow it seems so shallow, so inefficient when there is a depression in the society, how do you fit in? How can you cope when the prosperity level has dropped down? Then you&rsquo;re threatened with the possessions that you have and the inability to pay for the coverage of it. All of us are happy now until you&rsquo;re told in the next 10 minutes that you can&rsquo;t go into your house and sleep tonight, then you&rsquo;re gonna see everybody quaking all over the place because you start to imagine the impossible and more impossible problems that will come up because we can&rsquo;t go in and get under shelter at night. See what a tremendous pressure that is on your brain, no place to go lie down at night? And this applies to the body, why should it apply to the body? Because we have to care for it so that overexposure to the elements don&rsquo;t injure it, that puts us in states of responsibility as far as the mind is concerned, the functioning responsibility of your mechanism. How responsible are you to this mechanism? You can&rsquo;t (inaudible) and therefore you will always be praying to that fellow up in the sky, though you may shake your fist if you don&rsquo;t get your way but you&rsquo;re still asking Him, &ldquo;Look I need to sleep under some place tonight, I&rsquo;d hate to get wet all night with the rain or constantly hiding under some bridge.&rdquo; That part of your factual self comes up now, your internal attitudes. Then comes a part of you that gets what we call dreams, pre-cognitions, you can&rsquo;t help having them, you do have them, sometimes a blow on the head will give it to you, you&rsquo;ll see the light. Bump your head and you saw the light and you wonder why it&rsquo;s there, that&rsquo;s the extra sensory part of you and that has to be awakened, that has to be validated, it has to fit into the framework of who you are. And if it gives you a glimpse of conditions that will help you to better improve your existence, tell where to go and sleep tonight or where to find the next job and what to eat to stay healthy, then you&rsquo;re going to rely on it. So that part of you is going to come up and that&rsquo;s factual too about your structure. Last but not least everyone is going to walk out of the scene either six feet under the ground or go through the wall, pick your choice. Last time I saw one, they went down six feet under the ground, I don&rsquo;t see too many walk through the wall yet. So there we have something to consider, that&rsquo;s very factual about our mechanism and it&rsquo;s going to challenge us over the world, time and place, what do we do when we reach this point in time. Are we prepared for the birthday into the invisible? Do we make preparation for the invisible pregnancy? Did we make any restitution for the shortcomings while living in this visible realm and not owe anything when we go into that other realm to live. Now don&rsquo;t think for one moment we&rsquo;re going to escape anything, the bill collector still follows you, it&rsquo;s called sonics. So if it follows you all the way, you got bills to pay for a long time then there must be something that we can do. What is that something we can do? For centuries men have been calling that something spiritual life, not religious life because religious life can lead to fanaticism, it can make you walk out and clobber your fellow man to make him believe in you, that has nothing to do with spirituality. Spirituality is like the oil in a nut that can only come out after a long series of getting rid of the flesh around the nut, squeezing the heck out of the nut, and get the oil but religious life can be brushing the flower up, brushing the fruit up, and make it look nice and beautiful in the vase and say &ldquo;Here, look at me, I don&rsquo;t rot, I smell good.&rdquo; Yet inside the worm is eating his way out so don&rsquo;t get trapped in religious thinking though we have to start someplace and let&rsquo;s see if they don&rsquo;t have something to add to the process. Spirituality is what we&rsquo;re looking for and how to arrive at it but we have to work with the facts of ourselves and it&rsquo;s not something that ends up in a nebulous region, it&rsquo;s something that works moment-to-moment in a very practical simple way all around you and if it doesn&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;s not spirituality, it&rsquo;s still wishful thinking. Number one, factually you&rsquo;re born a winner. Number two, factually you communicate with sound. You hear sound waves, you compute it back to make it meaningful to you so what you say to yourself is very important, that&rsquo;s the programming of the computer. Number three, you eat your way through life and if you look, when you&rsquo;re young you eat a lot and when you get to middle age you start tapering off and when you get to old age, you&rsquo;re phasing off, you don&rsquo;t feel to eat as much. But you eat nevertheless to the last day before they phase you out, you&rsquo;re still putting something in your mouth and we as therapists will try our best to keep you going like an old automobile, we&rsquo;ll see if the gas will keep you going with the octane but that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re looking at a factual part of ourselves, what we eat, nutrition is that part of you. Again we can clog up the system and we do that when we&rsquo;re not informed and we have to clean it up because illness is the result and illness forces us to seek correction. We can blame the heavens for the illness, we can blame a lot of things for the illness but nevertheless the fact is you&rsquo;re ill and are you gonna clean it up, are you gonna quit getting ill? Are you gonna be in charge of yourself so it doesn&rsquo;t come back and dominate you or weaken you that you don&rsquo;t have any control or leave yourself helpless to it, this is the cleaning up process. In scriptural language they say &ldquo;cleanliness is next to Godliness,&rdquo; I just happen to change it a little and say &ldquo;cleanliness IS Godliness&rdquo; because I have to work with it moment to moment in my mechanism and I have to be conscious of it and Godliness is not &ldquo;holier than thou,&rdquo; far from it. Godliness is practicalness, you will discover that for yourself, that&rsquo;s why this gathering today is not a religious gathering and the friends that have invited me here are friends. I love you but I am not in love with you because to be in love is to fall out love and then I&rsquo;ll blame myself for making the mistake. But &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; we I have a wonderful relationship, a wonderful communion, very unending, very rewarding, that&rsquo;s different. 0:30 God is not in love with His world but God loves his world. Cleaning up is practicalness. All right, as far as the body is concerned and that&rsquo;s where we start, we can go to the mind and we can go to this spiritual nature but they happen to be in a range that tends to be nebulous at the moment. Investigation and research are in that field and certain data have come down but in the present moment, it will still be nebulous for us, we have to work our way through it and then eradicate or eliminate what is nebulous about the mind and what is nebulous about the spirit and see what is functional and practical and then we have an evaluation. Physically we know we are a winner, we can make ourselves losers by talking to ourselves, sonics will do that to us. Physically we know we eat and make ourselves sick, nutritional guidance corrects it but this guidance didn&rsquo;t come merely by sickness alone, it was set up before we came. If you look back to all the writings, no one would build an instrument without setting up a book of instructions on how to use it, I don&rsquo;t think any manufacturer would attempt that, right? So a book of instructions on how to run this organism already pre-existed merely called the scripture writings or Veda, the eternal knowledge but we might as well call it book of instructions on how to operate this mechanism. Nutrition is given as one of the rules of the instructions of how to operate and says &ldquo;eat everything that moves on the face of the Earth, everything that bears seed for food and for medicine.&rdquo; Well you know that can be a very broad, nebulous statement &ldquo;eat everything that moves on the face of the earth&rdquo; because you have the right to eat one another if that&rsquo;s what it means. But the word &ldquo;move&rdquo; is used, it doesn&rsquo;t say eat everything that flies or everything that walks or everything that swims or anything of crawls, it says eat &ldquo;everything that moves and has seed and bear fruit or seed for food and for medicine.&rdquo; Now certainly these men who wrote the book (inaudible) would not use such a word like &ldquo;move&rdquo; if they wanted us to eat creatures that crawl, walk, fly, or swim, they made it specific right? But they are specific when they say &ldquo;move.&rdquo; This object will not get from there to here no matter how it tries, it will grow a longer and longer and longer but it will not get from there to here until I do this, take it from there and put it here, then in essence I moved it. Now if those who know Dr. Vasant and his little dog and he comes running through the room, he&rsquo;s walking and running all at the same time. Now if I clobber him and eat him, I&rsquo;m depriving him of his own self motion. I&rsquo;m not stopping him and lifting him up and putting him in place, he has the ability to move on his own so he runs or he walks. Yet if you look back through time, Man had to eat not only what was capable of moving but he also ate things like walked, flew, and swam for survival sake thus clogging up the system by not knowing when to put it in. If he had to eat to survive, it was rational for him to catch the fish, catch the bird, catch the four-legged creature also get the fruit or the vegetable that was in season wherever he found it because he&rsquo;s a migrant person walking through, he didn&rsquo;t cultivate anything as yet. He was living strictly to survive like a child reaching out to put it in the mouth and sometimes you don&rsquo;t like to leave a dirty diaper around. So again you see the mouth has no way of differentiating until it tastes. All right, so Man had to taste to try and finally discover the practical mistakes in order to correct it. What they noticed as Man eventually got sick from putting in things incorrectly, certain individuals emerged trying to correct it in every culture but where did these men get their ideas from if everyone started out equal? How could a group of people in every area suddenly produce one or two or three individuals capable of a super knowledge to resolve the problems and the mistakes that these people are making? In each group we hear of these individuals and they call them medicine men and the word is right, medicine man. He doesn&rsquo;t do anything more than give you some medicine to ease the ache or Shaman. We haven&rsquo;t come too far, AMA or the wise owl and the porcupine or acupuncturist, we haven&rsquo;t come too far, cleaning up is where we are, the body has to be cleaned up. Okay, yet over the centuries we see men stepping out of the norm of behavior and going to the full ultimate of a behavior by certain ways of cleaning their bodies. If you put in something and it makes you sick, what is the natural behavior you would do if you saw it the next time? You wouldn&rsquo;t put it in because you know it made you sick. So innately you would stay away from it or negate it or fast from it, that means you wouldn&rsquo;t eat it or touch it. But before you do that, the little dog that Vasant has would have done it to show you so that you will learn from him. He will eat something bad and then he goes out and eats some grass and vomit it up, clean out his stomach and lie down and don&rsquo;t touch things and then you say he&rsquo;s smarter than you. His mouth got him in trouble, now his mouth is getting him out of trouble. (Laughter). So you&rsquo;re cleaning up yourself. All right you have fact number one, any place, any time that you can start the process of cleaning up yourself, fasting. For centuries Man has applied it and they all arrive at the same result that is a functioning mechanism capable of performing practical action. It didn&rsquo;t make them more religious, it didn&rsquo;t make them any smarter intellectually, but it made them practical in terms of their environment to survive. The result is factual, we are seeing now they have peace of mind because they can sleep more peaceful now and not worry about the aches and pains of a clogged up stomach, they were feeling healthier. 0:40 Spirituality is that quality of life that flows through you like a perfect timed automobile, your organism is functioning on time, it&rsquo;s synchronized and it&rsquo;s flowing without any tension. It&rsquo;s called peace that passes all understanding, it&rsquo;s not something you buy in the store or find in a book, it&rsquo;s the cleaning up in your mechanism. Okay, from the mouth standpoint you can clean up the body but you still got to realize you tell yourself you&rsquo;re a failure. You make mistakes and you may have doubts, you may have all type of arguments what to do or not to do and that is from age 1 to age 18 and you bursting at the seams to rebel and you can do your own thing you know, mother I&rsquo;d rather do it by myself. &ldquo;Well okay honey, go ahead do it by yourself and see how far you get.&rdquo; Mother ain&rsquo;t so stupid because mother has to pay the price or the cost factor for you to go on to be 18 years. So if you want to continue on your own, you&rsquo;ll find out how soon the cost factor becomes evident. Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves, our parents are essential. We may not put up with it or like it but when we look at it in terms of what is involved in a spiritual understanding, their contribution on the cost factor for our survival to give us the discipline, we may not appreciate it until we get sick and have to pay the cost factor and then we look back at each other and say &ldquo;oh mother now I understand how you feel&rdquo; or daddy and by that time the compassionate part of both are opening up, that&rsquo;s the heart. That 18 years or 21 years of frustrated living and battling not to conform leaves a lot of traumatic conditions in us and they can be programmed into all types of belief systems and yet they are not bad. For the moment they are impractical at times when it comes to facing yourself because you have to look at yourself and act and that&rsquo;s one of the things about spirituality, it&rsquo;s a principle locked into us that forces us to act what we say, like it or not. We may not do it when we are kids and we may rebel and go off but to function in an adult world with the cost factor involved, you learn pretty fast you act what you say. Otherwise nobody is hiring you and there is no roof to crawl in under the night, you see? So there again we&rsquo;re becoming conscious now, we&rsquo;re not going to end up fooling ourselves, we may end up healing ourselves and a great brother once said &ldquo;Physician, heal yourself.&rdquo; Well they&rsquo;re all physicians in the true sense of the word, it&rsquo;s knowing what to do with what you are that brings out the wonderful qualities of you. This fact about talking or saying something and acting it is what one author would call &ldquo;positive thinking,&rdquo; familiar with the book? Good, but at the same time it&rsquo;s a book of instructions if you want to take commandments, there are a group of instructions, they are positive thinking. You go full circle in the end that you have to say things to yourself and to act them. The mind now becomes stressed out by too much programming, have you ever been in a situation where you&rsquo;re over programmed and feel stressed out? The &ldquo;clatter, clatter, clatter&rdquo; the whole day and you just want to go where? In some corner to have a little peace and quiet? Good, that&rsquo;s very very necessary to the mechanism. When you are clattering clattering talking all the time, you may end up getting angry and lose your sense of happiness and that&rsquo;s what feeds the mind now. What feeds the body is the food and the cleansing of it so that you don&rsquo;t put in the wrong things to make it more sick. When it comes to the mind, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying to yourself and the constant exposure of the repetitiousness of things that makes you (inaudible). How to clean up the mind and find that part of the mind that keeps you happy? You need to have a factual principle about it and let&rsquo;s see a good illustration, happiness is nowhere to be found but in a contented mind, who has a contented mind? Anybody in this room got a contented mind? It&rsquo;s not possible to accomplish or acquire a contented mind, it doesn&rsquo;t exist but think of it this way now. &ldquo;Happiness is nowhere to be found but in the contents of the mind,&rdquo; do you think it&rsquo;s possible that you can generate happiness out of yourself now? &ldquo;Happiness is nowhere to be found but in the contents of the mind,&rdquo; equality through the verbal situations of what you say to yourself to make you feel happy and what you say in words can make you unhappy and what you say with the same words can make you happy because those are the contents of your mind, numbers and letters. They make geometry or images, they make combinations or words that mean something to you, I&rsquo;ll give you an example of happiness being the contents of your mind and not a contented mind. D-O-G is man&rsquo;s best friend, spell it backward and it&rsquo;s still the man&rsquo;s best friend. We haven&rsquo;t changed anything but we look at it the Chinese way and the Western way, left to right and right to left. You see what you did with the power of your mind? You free yourself and work with the contents and by working with the contents of the mind, you are releasing happiness out of it. So no one possesses happiness, yet everyone is essentially happy from the very contents that are contained in mind. This is spirituality, this understanding is spirituality because you can apply this any place, any time and know the D-O-G is man&rsquo;s best friend and G-O-D is still a man&rsquo;s best friend and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re male female or whatever nationally you want to be or whatever belief system you want to be you know that the alphabetical content of your brain is releasing happiness for you. 0:50 You don&rsquo;t have to impress anyone in it or try to make them believe you, it&rsquo;s not necessary. You being happy will make them think what you got, they want to know what kind of natural high you&rsquo;re living on. This is what&rsquo;s so interesting about spirituality once you understand it, not some nebulous experience in some remote part of the world, it&rsquo;s in you, the very core of you. As far as the mind is concerned and the happiness that it can release, it&rsquo;s based on the contents. Now many of us here are walking around with approximately a half of a dictionary in your brain, you realize how many words are in a half of a dictionary, let alone a whole encyclopedia that you can relate to and still more to come? Don&rsquo;t sell yourselves short, the spirituality is unending especially if you speak two or three different languages, that puts you in a wider scope of happiness. As my brother John here was saying, &ldquo;Bonjour,&rdquo; right? Good day, buenos dias, they all mean a good day to be happy yet if you can relate to all three ways of saying it, look how much happiness you&rsquo;re releasing then you begin to appreciate your fellow Man. If he can&rsquo;t speak English and you can&rsquo;t speak French, you can still shake hands, hug each other, smile, happiness is going to be released, it&rsquo;s in the mind, the contents of the mind to know to reach out, to shake their hand. Even though we may not be able to talk the language, it will convey the intent and that is where the spirituality of your brain is a factual experience that can be applied any place anytime and get the result. Now there are many techniques to slow the brain down and they all border on the range of sleep. You&rsquo;re very familiar with sleep from the time you were in the womb to the time you came out you&rsquo;ve been sleeping. So to be honest with yourself, you were more psychic than you ever thought but you never realized it, you never applied it, you never knew what it was, and then like Saint Paul said, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; He was shutting down every day, every moment, and getting into a state of semi-sleep or semi-death and experiencing something within his organism that made him happy, so happy that he could reject external enticements to be happy. That&rsquo;s why he says, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; Well the Lord must be a super fantastic excitement and since we can&rsquo;t recognize it outside, then this excitement has to be someplace else. It&rsquo;s inside of us, it&rsquo;s stored up in us, and it&rsquo;s so exciting that outer behavior doesn&rsquo;t begin to give it credit, we don&rsquo;t have enough words to give the credit to that internal excitement, that internal synchronicity. We do have dreams, we do close our eyes, and we do reflect on memories and it&rsquo;s fantastic when you think for one moment that yesterday you met me at the airport in a large airplane that occupied let&rsquo;s say this size of this room and more and you carry that whole image in your little brain for a heck of a long time, isn&rsquo;t that fantastic? But if you want to recall that image without going over to the airport and looking at the airplane again or getting a picture from them, you can just close your eyes and call it back on the screen. Now this doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do if you&rsquo;re a male or female or what you believe in or what color you are, it simply is that you know you can close your eyes and everybody closes them in the womb until they come out and keep on closing them and we close them when we end up doing nothing. So closing the eyes must have a value and I said yesterday when I was telling you folks you can either keep it wide open, close it completely, or half open. Now you may be accused of being an Oriental squinting all the time but that&rsquo;s where you can actually turn back in on your own internal image or screen and recall what you have seen during the day with the eyes wide open, that half open/half closed state. Now normally the eyes permit everyone in this room to look at, looking at is valid because we can test you and say you have good eyesight because you can look at this thing waving in the air and identify it and call it a hand, that is looking at, A-T, &ldquo;at.&rdquo; If I had it behind a glass, you would be looking at what? You&rsquo;ll be looking through and the transparency of the glass allows you to see through to the hand behind the glass, good. Now if this is possible externally for us to see through then it is possible for the brain to release this phenomenon to see through that wall. That&rsquo;s not miraculous, that&rsquo;s not religious, that&rsquo;s the real spirituality, the real atomic principle in you, seeing through. If you look at my hand, in the optical language they call that concave vision because you have concave lenses over the retina but if you look through, then you are focusing convex-ly for the first time and it becomes like a microscope or a telescope so you can see into the invisible or see through the mass to another level of observation. A blow on the head will give enough conviction that you can see through or you can take some hallucinogenic chemicals to convince you that the capacity to see through does exist. But those are not practical means of acquiring it because they have a residual danger in it, a blow on the head can be permanent, you may never recover from it. A drug may be toxic and may do damage to you and you may never get over it yet nature could not have put us together and leave us out here in the wide open to survive if it was not intended that we release this quality inside, a kind of a superman x-ray vision, &ldquo;Mr. Clark Kent, come on.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok fella but I&rsquo;m blocked by lead, I can&rsquo;t see through.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s very valid, don&rsquo;t kid yourself, whoever is writing the comic books are writing some valid facts. 1:00 The rate of the eyes can be accelerated to see through but when you will come in contact with a lead object, it&rsquo;s reduced back to the &ldquo;at&rdquo; stage instead of the &ldquo;through&rdquo; stage, you can&rsquo;t see through then. So nature has some unusual qualities allowing you to accomplish things but at the same time it restricts you in certain areas to make you respect it. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be very very egotistical and you try to show off, that will hurt yourself more than you hurt others. So their &ldquo;see through&rdquo; is a part of our spirituality that can be validated, tested, and is you. The highest spiritual nature now comes in terms of your cellular mechanism, what good is it to eat and never get sick? What good is it you can be so subtle with words and never make the wrong statement, you&rsquo;ll be a kind of diplomat that don&rsquo;t know how to say wrong, you&rsquo;re always saying yes and you&rsquo;re never going to say never. But then you come to a level where you can see through things to the point where you may become egotistical and get carried away with the fact that you can perform all type of manipulations with it, that is not sufficient to be spiritual. Though they are valid and they are factual and they can be used to be practical, it&rsquo;s not sufficient to be spiritual. We must have some physical evidence surrounding us in our environment that would give us an unbiased view of the principle of spirituality and it has to do with the cellular structure. It has been stated that when the cellular structure throws off corruption or breakdown or decomposition, when this cellular mechanism quits breaking down and takes on non-corruption, non-breakdown, non-decomposition, it&rsquo;s a glory unto the Lord, the Creative Principle. Now this cannot be just mere here-say, it cannot be something that we must wish for because it wouldn&rsquo;t be valid, it must be something that is pre-existing before we came on the scene, dormant in the life principle, waiting to be released by us when we become conscious of it, not before then. If that be the case, then it&rsquo;s valid. We have evidence of such a function that will fit, a caterpillar is a worm, all it does is eat like you and I, and then it spins its cocoon, that means it gets ready to die, and out of the cocoon emerges an unusual creature, a creature that can fly. Not crawl over the ground like a caterpillar, here is this creature that can fly, it&rsquo;s called a butterfly yet if you compare everything that actually is assigned to fly, they are not as beautiful as a butterfly. You have the most beautiful intricate designs in the mechanism of a butterfly. Now I have seen rotten caterpillars but I&rsquo;ve never found a rotten butterfly to this day. If you find one, let me know. They will crumble into power but they will not rot. That principle is in-resident in creation of the creative power within you, we can last on the scene of evolution or creation and we are carrying it in us. We have to release that in order for spirituality to be a science, otherwise spirituality is not a science, it&rsquo;s a tale of philosophy but we have living people who have done it and passed on. We have records that their body did not decompose after death. They are canonized and called Saints of all belief systems, their body is not decomposing. Now they also leave us with an unusual mechanism and at the same time they make us conscious that they were very simple, practical people. Spirituality is practicalness and transformation of this mechanism to its ultimate highest good, non-decomposition, as living testimony of what you carry within you. That does not limit the Creative Intelligence to leave a set of non-decomposing organisms here. There are evidence that many individuals never left their bodies after they reached the transition period, they took it with them. For one example there was a man called Kabir who lived in the 16th century, his purpose was to unite Hindus with Muslims. He tried his best and the day he died, the Muslim says &ldquo;We must bury his body according to our tradition.&rdquo; The Hindu said &ldquo;We must cremate his body according to our tradition&rdquo; and they argued back and forth what to do with Kabir&rsquo;s body and by that time Kabit got up and stood up and looked at them and shook his head and disappeared in front of their eyes and left them two roses. The Hindu took their rose and cremated it and the Muslims took their rose and buried it. Now you see the difference in spirituality and religious conflicts? The living organism that is carrying the inherent quality is ignored, the humanness is ignored. Now that we know it&rsquo;s a science and it can be experienced and it can be accomplished, here is the rub. Spirituality is the only science that is an art. No other art is a science to itself, yet spirituality is a science that is an art to itself because it&rsquo;s the art of living that you are accomplishing through a scientific process built into the organism that is locked in you that you have to release. Not something you have to what? Construct around yourself, that&rsquo;s the difference. It is something you have to release, every one of us including myself, has to release from within his organism and that makes it the art and that&rsquo;s what is the glory to God. His creation is an art, cannot be duplicated, cannot be competed with, and His highest expression is Man, His total inflection and reflection. Again, I repeat spirituality is the only science that is an art, a principle that you must release from within yourself and it&rsquo;s not constructed by your intellect around you but the ways to make it come forth are laid down by the factual parts of you. 1:10 The fact that you&rsquo;re born a winner, that you have to talk, provide for the body, live in the world, and go through the internal release of the mechanism&rsquo;s highest potential but you have to release it, it is your greatest opportunity to get behind the wheel. Thank you. Audience: We&rsquo;ll have a 10 minute break. (Gap in tape). Audience: I&rsquo;m somewhat familiar with reflexology and somewhat familiar with colonics but I was not familiar with Solar Nutrition, would you discuss that please? Adano: Solar Nutrition is based on not what you eat, it&rsquo;s when you eat it. I eat everything but I know when to eat it. Also you must know your blood type, otherwise you&rsquo;ll get sick. If you want to stay healthy and function and realize your reality, you must know your blood type. Now it is not what you eat but when you eat it and that includes everything in this world. Because I&rsquo;m 144 minerals, to exclude one would be a violation of my creative structure. So people who come into the knowledge of this type of eating are taken back because it may go against their belief systems but the wise man knows when to eat, not what to eat that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s always ahead of the sick people who turn to him for health. A little of anything, not something, anything is medicine for your system, too much is toxic and death. But by the same token since a little of everything is medicine for the system, you must know when to put it in. Platinum chloride is a very toxic material, we use it to cure cancer, a special type of cancer. Given at the wrong time of day, you will die of pneumonia the next morning. Given at the right time of the day, you&rsquo;ll live and go home that&rsquo;s valid facts proven by medical research now. They are slowly coming around to understand that the intake or admission of any substance into the organism is synchronized to time. I said earlier tonight, you might have driven up here with an expensive piece of machinery costing $7,500, it&rsquo;s a car. Did you pay for $7,500 worth of parts or timing? You would surely give them back the car if it&rsquo;s not running when it&rsquo;s out of time, otherwise you have a beautiful expensive antique junk. And that&rsquo;s the same that is true of this mechanism so Solar Nutrition and the term &ldquo;solar&rdquo; includes the light principles of our existence and the sonic principles behind it and it involves knowing when to put it in. Now I&rsquo;ll ask you a simple question, what food do you eat twice a day? Audience: Water. Adano: You eat water twice a day, good. Where is water formed? I see clouds, I don&rsquo;t see water till it collapses then something occurs, then it comes down as rain. It&rsquo;s a gas, yes, but there had to be a temperature change in order for it to convert into water. Now this particular temperature change can occur in light and in darkness, therefore it makes it a unique material that can be used 24 hours a day without stopping. You can never drink enough water but water is not an essential food per se in terms of growth through an organism necessary for keeping the body functioning. It&rsquo;s like putting water in your radiator, it will not run the engine but it&rsquo;ll keep the engine cool when the engine is running. Water is necessary for flushing your system, it will keep you alive but it will not give you the functioning mechanism, the protein that is necessary for cells to grow or the distribution of carbohydrates or minerals in the mechanism but it&rsquo;s necessary there like a cooling system for the refrigerating or the radiator of the car. For your body to keep cool and for it to eliminate waste products, you need it. So you can use water 24 hours a day but I&rsquo;m asking the young lady now of a solid food that she would eat twice a day. Audience: Yogurt. Adano: Yogurt, good. Before it was ever introduced in this country, it would be good to eat it more than once a day but yogurt made in this country is made out of cow&rsquo;s milk, it&rsquo;s not made from goat&rsquo;s milk where it originally began. Goat&rsquo;s milk is alkaline, cow milk is acid, you will develop mucus. Be my guest. (Laughter). Audience: What food would you eat twice a day? Adano: I don&rsquo;t eat any food twice a day because it&rsquo;s not practical. Every food is assigned a growth cycle and should be eaten once a day, therefore you have a whole spectrum of food that has every mineral necessary for all parts of your anatomy and spirituality locked into it. Before you came on the scene, the universe was set up as a spiritual principle and it&rsquo;s locked into the food already, we don&rsquo;t realize that. On the trees we have fruits and nuts. On the ground up to about five or six feet, we have animal, bird, vegetable, seeds. Under the ground we have in darkness, marine life, egg, or vegetables that grow under the ground. They all correspond to your anatomy and they all have a time to going to go in to be absorbed. Now if you&rsquo;re sick by eating out of the time cycle, then you can correct it by eating in the time cycle and nine times out of ten, people who come to me that are sick evidence point that they&rsquo;re eating foods out of their time cycle and the obvious problems they have is mucus, nerve pain, gas, dizziness, weakness, tiredness, and inability to cope with their daily life and they find every type of excuse that somebody is doing it to them. (Laughter). 1:20 If they told you that I specialize in Solar Nutrition, it is because I had to heal myself of cancer and other diseases and a broken body and I&rsquo;ve tried every other method even to lose weight. They&rsquo;re all good methods, I don&rsquo;t discredit them, I respect them all from wherever they come from but it didn&rsquo;t correct my problem. And I worked with a wonderful person who was a devout Krishna-ite from the Krishna movement. He was their number one chef, studied all the Vedantic knowledge on cooking, couldn&rsquo;t heal himself of a simple illness after following all the Vedantic studies and finally ended up at my clinic and the first thing I look at him and says &ldquo;How come you and I born from the same country and you can&rsquo;t find out how to correct the problem after studying all these religious knowledge?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re eating certain foods at the wrong time.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Well that don&rsquo;t make sense, all the food I eat is healthy food, they&rsquo;re all vegetarian.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yes, but you don&rsquo;t know your blood type. If you knew, you would quit doing certain types of foods and put them in the right time cycle.&rdquo; He went away and I didn&rsquo;t see him for 28 days. Now he&rsquo;s still their number one chef in their brand new restaurant all geared to Solar Nutrition cooking. He has taken their Vedic knowledge and regulated it to time and feed them. Now the menu is Vedic eating, vegetarian eating, but synchronized the proper timing for the first time. It&rsquo;s not a secret, it&rsquo;s knowing when and that&rsquo;s what I specialize in. Audience: What do you when you wake up at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning and say &ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;d like ice cream?&rdquo; Adano: Ah! Now we call that lunar nutrition. (Laughter). I also indulge in lunar nutrition because you see the human body is not designed to be 100% solar, neither 100% lunar. You&rsquo;re not two ovums put together or two sperms put together, you are a sperm and an ovum put together. The sperm is the alkaline part of you and the ovum is the acid part of you and you&rsquo;re 80% alkaline and 20% percent acid, every 28 days the ovum is formed and released. Now a pregnant woman would eventually wake up at two in the morning and go look for a sour pickle and yogurt and ice cream and that&rsquo;s valid because the chemistry requires that and she only does it for a certain length of time in the 28 days of the pregnancy. It&rsquo;s knowing when to put it in and therefore in this country we don&rsquo;t suffer from malnutrition or lack of nutrition, we suffer from wrong timing it&rsquo;s called potluck eating. (Laughter). Years ago on the frontiers on a Sunday all the folks would get together at the church and bring what they had and after the ceremony they would always spread the cloth out and put it all there to be eaten. Well the women will get off to themselves because they are watching their figure so they will pick and then they will discuss the latest fashions of how to weave. The men will get off and discover what to do with Jake the horse because he&rsquo;s a miserable creature and want to find a mechanical horse now. So they are busy plotting how to make the mechanical horse and get rid of Jake the real horse. In the meantime you and I are kids, we will crawl all over the tablecloth and put food in our mouth and then we get all nice and chubby. It&rsquo;s called potluck eating but that&rsquo;s valid from age one to thirty-one and you&rsquo;re entitled to muck it up then clean it up after. If you pass 31, then you&rsquo;re in the cleanup process. If you&rsquo;re not there, keep on going. You see it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to you if you try to correct the body if you haven&rsquo;t saturated it with incorrect eating, this method would not make any sense to a person but if you trace back the origin of the two laws underlying it, you will see that the wise men that gave the laws did live and these laws are still today with us. A little of anything is medicine for the system, too much is toxic. The fellow that gave that was a guy named Corn-fucious, pretty corny, Confucius. And the other one waited many many years after to discover that something was lacking in it and he came up and said one day &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time and a place and a season for everything,&rdquo; his the name was Solomon. So look how long between Solomon and Confucius men were busy mucking it up and cleaning it up until they find out timing. But by that same process we have a lot of religious ideas coming down involving the relationship to get back to the source of our spiritual nature but we cannot separate spirituality from health. It&rsquo;s highly erroneous to say a spiritual person is an unhealthy person, not true. If you&rsquo;re spiritual, you will be healthy, you&rsquo;ve got something that puzzles everybody otherwise you&rsquo;re not spiritual, you&rsquo;re missing the boat. The spiritual person is functioning on a scientific process that produces results and doesn&rsquo;t have to go off in any location to do it. Right on his two feet there he is, he can do the process of starting to clean up and he doesn&rsquo;t have to wait to be told by any belief system what to do. His own body will become the obvious thing. So Solar Nutrition is geared to time, not &ldquo;what.&rdquo; Audience: Did you hear about Norman Cousins and how he healed the illness that was in the collagen? He was literally coming unglued at the seams and he healed his illness through laughter and other holistic means. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve heard anything about gearing the kind of food or the timing of it as related to healing his illness, that&rsquo;s an entirely new concept for me. Adano: There are three types of remedies for every illness: nutrition, psychological, and placebo. Nutrition can be chemical. Psychological can be programming. And placebo is we can fool ourselves into getting well. All three work, it depends on your toxicity at the time you have the problem and your attitude to yourself. Now you see why all work? The collagen in the body can be healed by laughter for some people. It may be healed by placebo to fool himself or herself or by chemical induction or nutrition. Sickness is not what we think it is, sickness is one&rsquo;s own karmic obligation to an unfulfilled pattern not resolved in a past life that must be paid off in this life. For example, let&rsquo;s say two lives ago you hurt 15 people and you were able to resolve their hurt by meeting 10 of them and became friends again and resolved it. Five of them could not be met because they passed on and you will have to go out of the body with the unresolved five. Then you&rsquo;ll come into your next life which will be the last life and you may run into three of those people in that life and you may resolve it, you still got two more to go. But in the meantime in that last life, you bumped into another 20, you see? And you resolve maybe seven or eight out of that 20, so then you can take the sum total of what is left over and then this life now you&rsquo;ve got to resolve and you&rsquo;re only resolving it in the form of a sickness. 1:30 You&rsquo;re going to find some ache or pain, it&rsquo;s going to show up, some person is going to cause it to occur in you and you&rsquo;ll finally have to face it and resolve it. So none of the things that are happening to people and may seem miraculous, they are working out an unfinished obligation. I&rsquo;ve been in the miraculous, I fell in the miraculous, and I&rsquo;ve broken my body up but I had to heal the body or go through the healing in a non-dramatic way. My body healed itself, all the functions came back to normal except the bone (inaudible). That was on the fourth day after my accident. Then dramatically would have meant that I walked immediately off the bed, broken bones and everything would have sealed up, that would have been dramatic yet I would be a living freak today because I&rsquo;m not able to explain to you who is suffering and you would want something so dramatic that you&rsquo;ll push yourself out of psychological balance just to get that dramatic, that is not valid. The psychic or miraculous healings are for people who have gone to the bottom and out of desperation have been pushed back to have a chance to reconcile. So a great deal of their unfinished patterns are like unpaid bills they are relieved by an inheritance that came to you but they still got some more to pay so that big lump sum can fall in their lap and relinquish the debt. We don&rsquo;t know how many people we&rsquo;ve hurt or have hurt us because we have to tap the memory banks. So that form of healing is valid for that person who discovered it. Solar Nutrition may be valid for me, it may not be valid for you, see what I mean? Lunar nutrition may be more valid for you than for me, see? Again each one of us has different things to work out. Audience: Could you mention a little bit about the blood types? Adano: There is Type A+ or A-, Type B+ or B-, the plus or minus are the Rh factors. And then there&rsquo;s AB+ or AB- and then there&rsquo;s O+ or O-. Now A and AB plus or minus can be a hundred percent non-meat eaten but they cannot be a hundred percent meat eater. They will develop acidosis if they try to be 100% meat eater but they can live 100% non-meat eater. Most people who go into the spiritual life and make any headway in it are usually a Type A or AB Type. I don&rsquo;t happen to be a Type A or AB, I happen to be an O. So B and O can be a 100% meat eater but cannot be 100% non-meat eater. We develop another type of disease called alkalinosis or pain or strictures, tensions. And also there&rsquo;s an outward rash where the skin is dry but it doesn&rsquo;t weep. Whereas the A and the AB will develop another type of rash where it could weep because they&rsquo;re trying to be 100% pure in any one of the other things, it&rsquo;s not possible, nature that did not allow us to come out that way. There are reasons why we&rsquo;re like that and we&rsquo;re placed in these types to work out the karmic obligation. If you&rsquo;re going to go back to the source of your nature immediately, you may be&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1983-july-28-part-2---flagstaff-memory">1983 July 28 Part 2 - Flagstaff Memory</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_28_2FlagstaffMemoryQ2NW3 - Thank you Dr. Vasant (Dr. Vasant Merchant) and all these wonderful folks here. Memory is a vast subject, in fact it includes everything. I look at memory in different ways that you may be aware of because I had to learn different ways of looking at the English language so I break down memory into ME-MOR and then Y. Now I&rsquo;m going to spell it my way, ME-MOR-Y. Now let&rsquo;s see what we&rsquo;ll get out of M-E-M-O-R-Y and ME-MOR-Y. You&rsquo;re going to find that M-E-M-O-R-Y is going to be limited after a while, it&rsquo;s a sense of limitation involved in it, it doesn&rsquo;t reach out where you want to go and it can be very frustrating and at the same time can be very depressive and it can act like a prison. Now how will you break out to find enlightenment? If the prison should have its own freedom, then the very word should carry its own liberation. Let&rsquo;s see now ME-MOR-Y, did you break out? ME is boundless and more of ME will always make you more boundless (inaudible). You can never encompass the total memory of you because it&rsquo;s the very first two letters structured into it that sets up the container propagator and the unending potential in it, ME. Now if you want to go back into the psychological aspect of that or religious aspect of ME, you&rsquo;ll find that very first commandment to Man as a manifestation from the Creative Intelligence and intelligence carries memory, &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other Gods before who?&rdquo; Audience: Me. Adano: Now is that the biggest memory existing? But we don&rsquo;t have enough of it yet, we have to dig more into it so that&rsquo;s the other part of the ME, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s thrown upon each one of us, the MOR. How to dig out more out of me but you don&rsquo;t realize this until years after you&rsquo;re born. When you came in at the time of birth, the ME of you is temporarily shut down and if you spoke like this when you broke the ear &ldquo;Ahhhh,&rdquo; everybody says you&rsquo;re crying but you may say &ldquo;Boy am I happy I got here&rdquo; but nobody knows that&rsquo;s what you mean. Then they have to program you to adjust to your environment and in programming you rule number one is repetition, sounds familiar? And mother and father make you do something over and over and over until it ingrains itself into your memory bank. In actuality you came with a bank full of the ME in you but you can&rsquo;t express it because nobody knows what the heck you&rsquo;ll be saying and you can&rsquo;t release it but externally they&rsquo;ve programmed you to adapt. Then the conflict begins with the &ldquo;you&rdquo; and the &ldquo;you,&rdquo; everyone is like this, &ldquo;Are you you, are you you?&rdquo; And then you start comparing and then to compare you have to rely on what you&rsquo;ve been programmed by or with, numerals and letters of the alphabet. How much, what is, how many, because you&rsquo;re going to count in the numbers and what is it in terms of letters of the alphabet. The strange thing is that you don&rsquo;t seem to get out of numbers and letters yet we will create the fantastic fabric of communication that will satisfy our intellect and generate a communication between the &ldquo;you, you, you&rdquo; and totally ignore the real ME that is locked up to you. Yet periodically when you go to sleep, a part of your mechanism begins to fire up in terms of images and you wake up the next morning and you say &ldquo;I had a strange or crazy dream.&rdquo; Now to tell someone you had that, they may think you&rsquo;re crazy, it&rsquo;s hard to convey what you&rsquo;ve experienced inside of yourself. Now this crazy dream or internal photography is occurring inside of you, it&rsquo;s occurring inside of your cells, and let&rsquo;s take a little example of you wake up from a sleep and you say to someone &ldquo;I just dreamt or saw an object that looked like a bird, had wings, but in a strange way it had no feathers and yet it didn&rsquo;t move like a bird but it was flying in the sky and the object was so far away from the Earth, it&rsquo;d be highly impossible for to stay up that long and it made a complete circle around the Earth. Then suddenly it decided to descend on an open plain and land but when it landed I got a close up view and it didn&rsquo;t have any wings like the usual planes that we are accustomed to see.&rdquo; Now someone listening to you they say that you might be hallucinating or crazy and they ask you &ldquo;how old are you fella?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh 15.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re telling me this dream now, when did this dream occur?&rdquo; &ldquo;It occurred when I was three years of age.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re 15 years now and you had this dream that you didn&rsquo;t want to tell nobody?&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; And if you backtrack to age three, such an object was not in existence yet now at age 15 such an object of this boy&rsquo;s dream is in existence. A fantastic quantum leap has occurred inside that boy&rsquo;s mechanism that is making all of us ponder that we really don&rsquo;t know what a tremendous reservoir we are carrying and the memory was the label for that experience. 0:10 For the average individual he will stay on the outer crust and never investigate or he may try to throw all kind of aspirations to such a phenomenon but as we approach more and more into the atomic reality of ourselves, we can&rsquo;t do that anymore. We&rsquo;re on the verge of making another quantum leap inside of our cellular mechanism back to the real me. Everyone is questioning himself who he is, what he is, and why he is? Why should he be victimized or feel out of position in his environment and only have just a meager existence, it&rsquo;s not enough. The span of life is too short to warrant leaving yourself in that state, you want to know more, you want to get more out of life and you deserve it but where do you start? For centuries men have often told us to go back to birth as a starting place. Physiologically, memory really is in the cells but before you can look at the cell and analyze it and test it for its memory content, the very environment in which we live in is a layout or a blueprint of the structure of the cell. We may call it evolution as a label for the layout and then we may argue between someone saying &ldquo;no you were created&rdquo; and the conflict will begin with evolutionists and creationists. Those who don&rsquo;t know may side with the creationists or may side with the evolutionists. Those who really understand what is going on, there is no argument existing as yet but what is actually existing is an argument between evolutionists and in-volutionists, not with creation. Creation is valid like a jigsaw puzzle, involution and evolution are the parts of the puzzle (inaudible) but you don&rsquo;t know what the end product will look like until you put all the pieces together then you&rsquo;ll see the actual picture of the jigsaw puzzle. So the argument would be always going on between evolutionists and creationists never getting to the core of the problem. Now it&rsquo;s not possible to tap your memory in its fullest context until you refocus between evolution and involution. Now for centuries wise men have come down giving us a clue or a way back to the involutionary makeup that would disclose to us the whole memory, the &ldquo;me&rdquo; and the more of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you. They outline it by saying &ldquo;Unless you be born again, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; Now the kingdom of heaven is a reservoir if you want to look at it that way and a reservoir would be the total memory bank and another name for the memory bank could be called the akashic records where things are stored. And we have very outstanding people who have tapped into the record bank and extracted data out of it but what is more important? Not their tapping in to the bank, it is you and I tapping in to the bank, knowing how your bank is set up in you, and knowing what is possible for you to tap into your bank and utilize what is necessary to be utilized from that bank in a practical manner moment to moment. That&rsquo;s why you need to know your structure, you need to know how you&rsquo;re put together then you can get behind the wheel and drive it. If you start off with what has been accepted, that this universe (inaudible) is a result of atomic waves and these waves originally are sonics then that would validate scriptural writing, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; Word is sonics, acoustics, vibrations. What are you experiencing between my mouth and your ears? (Inaudible), that you would call the mechanical memory now, that&rsquo;s the physiology of the part in which you want to store it and confront you with it. &ldquo;Adano, is this your voice?&rdquo; You would you be totally surprised if you hear it all these years talking but now when it&rsquo;s played back via a mechanical gadget, it sounds like but you&rsquo;re not too certain. Yet that is where we are at now, the evidence is sonics and if you come back to creation that is written by the wise men we will see this phenomenon. In the Genesis, that&rsquo;s the start, &ldquo;Let there be&rdquo; sound or light, which one? Audience: Light. Adano: Okay then if it&rsquo;s light, &ldquo;let there be light,&rdquo; is sound commanding light or is light commanding sound? Sound commanding light then if sound commands light then the very core of the physiology of memory is established now at the sonic level. You come out and I come out at birth and cry &ldquo;Waaaahh.&rdquo; We are what emphasizing or qualifying our origin, we are bringing our real me back, the real memory bank back but our parents may not be qualified or perceptible enough. There are a few like that that can be qualified to recognize what is being said at that level and in the East there&rsquo;s a story that goes when the Saint Vyas had written his Bhagavad Gita and dictated it to the wife when she was pregnant, the very first attempt of sleep learning&hellip; you see your memory banks aren&rsquo;t so so new you know, these ideas seem so strange now but men have been practicing a long time to get to the memory bank or store it to pass it on and then when a child is born and grows up, it confronts the father by repeating the whole complete information. That happened in distant time, it&rsquo;s not impossible in present time, in fact in this country today many of the young people are astonishing their elders with recall of the memory bank, physiologically locked in and ready to go. If we don&rsquo;t pay any attention to it and we don&rsquo;t make a conscious contribution to learn about ourselves from within the structure, we will be missing the boat again. Birth is the doorway to look in, also the ecology how it&rsquo;s set up and they must synchronize, they must cooperate, and they must validate each other otherwise it&rsquo;s just conversation. Sonics directs light, agreed? Light is perceived by optics so many people say they don&rsquo;t want to hear God, they&rsquo;d like to see Him but &ldquo;No Man sees God and lives&rdquo; (laughter). So again the memory back is telling us something that we need to know about ourselves. 0:20 Yet in a strange phenomenon when you&rsquo;re dying and I&rsquo;ve been there and all the organisms are shutting down, all the sensory functions are shutting down, the only function that doesn&rsquo;t shut off is the sense of hearing. That&rsquo;s one part of your mechanism that does not turn off. We may be very dead, six feet under the ground but you&rsquo;re still hearing, that&rsquo;s very freakish. It&rsquo;s because of that connectiveness, regression techniques have been evolved to take people back to past life experiences because that&rsquo;s the tape. Mechanically we have it now to vouch for but then we can also add optics to it too. You see a TV came after radio, optics came after sonic. In the progression and in the memory bank the same is true, &ldquo;As above,&rdquo; which means what is visible, &ldquo;so it is below&rdquo; meaning what is the invisible is also in the visible level of your existence. So the argument is not with evolution and creation, the argument is with evolution in pollution involution only represents unseen the invisible part of nature and evolution and involution. Involution only represents unseen, the invisible part of nature and evolution only represents the unreeling or rolling off so it&rsquo;s visible and measurable. Then you don&rsquo;t have your complexes no more, you don&rsquo;t feel left out, you&rsquo;ve got to find your place in this (inaudible) from the invisible to the visible, from the sonic level to the optic level. There&rsquo;s where your real memory bank begins now but it goes back into the birth and into the structure of our environment. We come down through sonics into light then gas, firmament, all around us is gas. As far as it can go into our space, we will find gas of various types and then the gas will shift in its temperature. The lower the gas comes to the surface the temperature varies, the more it goes higher the temperature varies and those who fly planes know that, how fast the temperature shifts in different air pressures. When you come down now to the next level of gas, you get liquid and the liquid will look like a cloud in the form of a gas and yet when two clouds hit each other, we see lightning and we hear thunder. Yet strange in our thinking and memory bank you will always say lightning came before the thunder, right or wrong? That&rsquo;s not valid, that&rsquo;s the illusion because light travels faster in the media of the air, the optics register on your photographic/hologrammic mechanism of the cell registering it as being fast. But in actuality the thunder was first before the lightning because the two things have to hit first. Like when you scratch a match, you hear the scratch and see the light but because it&rsquo;s so close into you, you will say that the scratching of the match against the matchbox came first before the light. In a larger experience, you hear the thunder last and see the lighting first because of the distance you have to relate to but the two clouds have to collide into each other, strike each other to trigger the ignition. And when we come to our mechanical world and try to duplicate this, the friction action then be lighting up occurs, it is always sound before light. Now this does not invalidate what the wise men have said for centuries, in fact this keeps validating that sonics commands light to occur, it releases the light in whatever form but it releases it. so we&rsquo;re getting a structure of our physiology and we&rsquo;re getting the memory where it really begins so that we start to program it, you&rsquo;ll get better use of it now, seeing how it&rsquo;s set up, it&rsquo;s set up from a sonic level. The liquid that separates from the cloud after the crash comes down as rain but that liquid if you were to measure it or catch it and analyze it, you&rsquo;ll find substances floating in it. Also when that liquid finally lands, it crystallizes in some form. If you dehydrate it out, you&rsquo;ll find a crystal. We are essentially then crystals, one can say we are essentially soil, S-O-I-L. Now if you want to read this a little different in your writings, &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image, male and female God created them and breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living soil,&rdquo; would that be invalid knowing how you put together now for the first time? And it&rsquo;s not a desecration of your nature, in fact it is the highest elevation of your true makeup, then you can agree that &ldquo;&ldquo;Remove your shoes for the ground thou standest on&hellip;&rdquo; is what? Sacred now, you see? The soil is sacred if you understand structure but if you don&rsquo;t then you don&rsquo;t have a true memory bank to work with, it&rsquo;ll delude you, you&rsquo;ll always end up making a mess of it but if you got the true understanding of the memory bank, the real me is you, and more of you coming out of it all the time, you&rsquo;ll start to see now where it will all connect as you work with it physiologically in equipment or in the tissues. The laws don&rsquo;t breakdown, we may break ourselves against them but they don&rsquo;t break down, they are always repeating themselves constantly as the underlying link. We are crystalline in structure but what is unique about us as human beings is that our crystalline structure is in a viable state whereas this crystalline structure is in a petrified state (Adano rings a bell). It&rsquo;s not viable but this came before us, that petrification came before this viable state. We are last in the act of creation but we are the first in the quality of creation. Remember they said &ldquo;first is last and last is first&rdquo; but we never knew to what memory bank it was really applying to, finally we found out it&rsquo;s applying to what is still yet to be released in ourselves, that inner higher quality from what is locked up in the memory bank of ourselves. 0:30 So when the wise man tells us to go back to birth as a starting point, he&rsquo;s giving us the clue of how to look at this physiological vibrant mechanism with all the minerals locked up in it and to understand its ability to record or store data. Now we are a year old in the womb before the cord is cut but we are not an individual, we are still an attachment to an organism that is providing the problems and the hosting of it. The sperm is in the father, maybe X amount of months or years, and the ovum is in the mother but when they bond then you have the pregnancy and the nine months of your mother carrying the pregnancy. But we are not two ovums, neither are we two sperms, we are a sperm and and ovum. These these are actual life forms that carry on a fantastic job of bonding to form a human mechanism like this. Now if you look at an ovum and a sperm under a microscope you couldn&rsquo;t give it credit for memory, not when you look at a human being standing next to it. You say to yourself &ldquo;that has memory?&rdquo; But then (inaudible) may look at you and say &ldquo;Yeah if you can see the mite that&rsquo;s next to it, you need a more powerful microscope&rdquo; then you may find something about memory, deep encoded laws working inside that cellular organism waiting to be released. Yet it forms this body, sets up this fantastic machinery in such a fantastic way that you&rsquo;re amazed at how a whole human body can command one molecule of hemoglobin to move through the skin and if you begin to think of all the different minerals and vitamins that have to move on command in your body to keep you going, that&rsquo;s a fantastic memory reservoir. Now equipment came late and was beneficial to modern Man. Early Man didn&rsquo;t have equipment to rely on, he had to go back to what you would call the crazy dream state of the youth who saw the shuttle before it was invented and that&rsquo;s where early Man went to, he went back inside with his internal mechanism to look in. Memory is in the cell, you can program it by repetition from after birth but here is a strange phenomenon of memory in yourselves. Those who heard me last night I made a remark by saying &ldquo;No one is born a loser, everyone is born a winner.&rdquo; That may sound philosophical, psychological, but now let&rsquo;s look at it physiological in terms of memory. The sperm that got to the ovum was a loser, right or wrong? Wrong, right? Now you can&rsquo;t argue with physiology because you wouldn&rsquo;t be here to be talking to me so the sperm that got to the ovum and the innermost core of the ovum that was essential for it to lock in and become a human being was the winner. But by the same token if you go all the way back into the structure of your makeup and you look at how sperms are working towards the ovum, you will see every behavioral pattern exercised by the teeming masses of sperm that you couldn&rsquo;t realize that outside in the outer world that&rsquo;s very very small of what we will call the brutality and the abuse of the outside world in comparison to what is going on in the inner world. Yet the law says &ldquo;As above so below,&rdquo; what&rsquo;s going on in the invisible must go on on the visible level. We have an unfinished tape of memory yet waited to be released out into the visible so if we are violent in there and we come out here and appear to be violent and we&rsquo;re trying to regulate the violence and claim wrong reasons for the violence, that wouldn&rsquo;t be valid. We have to go to the memory bank to see if the violence is a part of the process of evolving and that it&rsquo;s not a negative condition or a positive condition, it is a required process where organisms must interact to be evolved and your condition which you call fight or flight sensation, where did it originate? After birth or before birth? Yes, before birth but you don&rsquo;t know or remember that until it&rsquo;s activated in you and to go back to that level and that&rsquo;s why the wise men say &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;re born again you can&rsquo;t enter the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not some glorious nebulous place where the Lord is sitting in some antiseptic corner waiting for you, God is the envelopement of everything that He puts out. But passing back through those levels of the memory, it may be challenging to your logical thinking but as far as your sensory makeup is concerned, no, it withstood the pressure of the centuries of time to formulate into an organism to make you. That&rsquo;s why anytime we go inward to the source of the memory banks, we seem to perform a strange behavior from the outside world. The outside world sees us do this (Adano does something), when you go to people who have an ability to tap the memory bank, an adult especially may look at you like this. &ldquo;I see a green pasture.&rdquo; This behavior if not understood by some people, you may think it&rsquo;s some kind of illness or you&rsquo;re delirious. Yet this form of slipping in and out of the memory bank is part of the process, it&rsquo;s a form of duplicating sleep which is a mini-death and then our friend Brother Paul would say &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; What is he really doing? He&rsquo;s dipping into the memory bank of his real self, the Me of himself and getting more out of it so if you think you really enjoying yourself by the evolutive nature of yourself, wait until you get to discover the involuted nature of yourself then you&rsquo;re really enjoying it all. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trying to get us to recognize, living and dying daily meaning opening and shutting the eyes, slowing the brain down, bringing it back to the norm, and dipping in to study the cellular structure. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for, to study, it&rsquo;s an internal TV set. One can say today we spend our lives sitting behind a TV screen from morning until night trying to get programs, ancient Man might be looking at the cellular TV set from finding out the origin of programs. As you dip in to this memory bank then we will start to see strange phenomenas coming up that may challenge you in terms of the chemistry, the actual chemistry of your makeup becomes obvious now. They may not be accepted in the outer world but they are there and it constantly confronts you. You may make notation when you come out then you have to go prove it if you&rsquo;re lying to yourself or if these are hallucinations or if they are valid. 0:40 By the same token a quantum leap will occur at that physiological level that you may perceive a way to measure those substances inside, bring it out to the outer world, develop a type of mechanical gadget that will validate it and then it&rsquo;s called an invention. Then that&rsquo;s the first breakthrough from the logical level to the biological level. Now we can measure back. Each one of us has access here but we don&rsquo;t use it because we&rsquo;re not aware of it. The environment will force us more and more under necessity to get there, then we will realize that necessity is really the mother of the invention, is really the mothering agency that pushes us back into our memory. The more the need gets stronger, the more we&rsquo;re going to look for something to offset it for the solution but the solution is found in what we openly call creativity, yet when you get to creativity you&rsquo;re surprised that creativity is waiting for you as a memory. You see what kind of a problem we get into? We find ourselves returning to a memory bank, more of the Me in You already locked up, already stored up, ready to be released if you are prepared for it and if the necessity is strong enough to enhance it to leap forward. Then you can go into the measurements of the brain, the two halves of the brain, and see how they coordinate right down to the various movements of the body. In my type of work where I have to deal with people who are hurt and don&rsquo;t require any medical tension from the standard methods, the x-rays don&rsquo;t show any breakdown in the bone structure, various (inaudible) don&rsquo;t show any deterioration in the tissue, yet the patient complains about a pain that keeps recurring in that area of the injury. We do every kind of testing but then the patient still complains, is the pain of fantasy or is the pain a feedback from a memory bank? In a strange way we do identify the pain from a memory bank because we have ways to look at the pain communication. Now before we approach it in terms of mechanical gadgets to measure the memory bank of the pain, wise men of ancient time, we used to call them the Oracles or Seers, See-r is to see right through. Today we call them psychics or para-psychologists, you could go to one of them and they may look at you and they will see the outer electrical field of the body and they will say you will have a blue aura today, that was their way of diagnosing the memory bank and then they may ask if you had some disappointment lately? And he said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and then you may define the disappointment but they were able to pinpoint in you from looking at the electrical field, your predicament and it&rsquo;s storing itself in your memory bank and it&rsquo;s now aggravating the mechanism and the pain sensation keeps coming up in the location of the injury. That at one time was considered ritual or shamanism and medicine man and they use the term correctly among the American Indians, medicine man, and that&rsquo;s all he was, a man who either relied on herbs or the inward sight to look at the problem from the memory bank to solve the patient&rsquo;s problem. Today we&rsquo;re approaching it more in the mechanical validation and the Kirilian camera comes along now as a mechanical device to actually look at the electrical impulses being given off in certain areas. Now let&rsquo;s say this is a healthy tissue, the memory of this tissue is that one milligram of Vitamin A must travel across my wrist to my little finger every four hours by command of the brain and unless it goes there, this finger will not be performing efficiently. Every four hours one milligram must travel (gap in tape)&hellip; milligram every four hours. It&rsquo;s like this house, this house is not built by sheer wishing, a blueprint had to be drawn up then the parts are put together and the house functions but the blueprint doesn&rsquo;t tell you how the tenant will behave in the house. That&rsquo;s the thing you have to consider now, the blueprint only gives you how the house is structured out, you the occupant is the consciousness. You the occupant is the force field that came in when the cord was cut to make it enhance, dilate and constrict to a rhythm but the structure, the blueprint, is already set up and you can tap into it and get to that force field. Okay, agree that one milligram has to travel across a certain area to nurture that area to be on time, then externally something comes along and hit it and there&rsquo;s a sensation of pain, it registers on the brain. You go to the doctor, the pain is so terrific that you can&rsquo;t stand it, it swells up. You go to the doctor x-rays it and says &ldquo;no broken bone&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s swollen because of the impact and there&rsquo;s certain life forms in there that are going to be not performing on time. Now if he measures that vitamin distribution he says &ldquo;well it&rsquo;s not going there every four hours, it&rsquo;s going there every six hours and you&rsquo;ll need more Vitamin A to go through to compensate for the swelling.&rdquo; Your memory for that amount is demanding and the brain is triggering the sensation that it&rsquo;s not getting it so it&rsquo;s quivering, it&rsquo;s hurting, and so when you put it in then you find the alleviation be it a vitamin or a mineral or whatever it is that is required, it&rsquo;s off its timing. The reason I&rsquo;m trying to get timing to you at the physiological level of the memory, it will play an important part to understand memory at the psychological level and at the spiritual level but until you recognize timing at the physiological level or it&rsquo;s structured into you already, you will not appreciate your memory how it works via the psychological level, let alone how it works for you via a spiritual level. The Creator, like every manufacturer, made a beautiful piece of equipment but the last thing He did to it was timing. Now all of you who came here have driven in beautiful cars, you paid a lot of money for it, but did you buy $6,500 or $7,500 worth of parts or $6,500 or $7,500 worth of timing? Now that&rsquo;s locked into the memory bank so intricately that our outer world cannot operate without it. That timing is very physiologically locked in, psychological, and spiritually locked in, it has to be there because that&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re going to really be satisfied with. When the person hands you the key and you turn the engine over and it doesn&rsquo;t work properly, you&rsquo;re gonna hand it back to him. All right, knowing that timing is involved in your cellular structure and it has to do with the transportation of all the material through on time to make this organism behave as an organism, then when it is released at birth and the cord is cut and the air is taken in, if it doesn&rsquo;t breathe or retain that air, that timing is off we have to do either artificial respiration to get the timing but when the timing is off permanently, it&rsquo;s off, the mechanism would not work, it cannot contribute to its environment, the timing is off. 0:50 When the timing is synchronous to the organism, it&rsquo;s a human organism that is moving and having its freedom in the environment. Now what is locked into the psychological bank of that organism is what will come from how you program it. Now if the parents program data in before birth at the pregnancy level, that&rsquo;s a fantastic amount of data stored up in that psychological makeup so we see now the offspring will come out acting out these particular data. If we program after birth, the offspring will act the data entirely different because that&rsquo;s after birth not before birth. Then there&rsquo;s a connection between how parents react before pregnancy and after pregnancy and how the organism responds before pregnancy is over and after pregnancy or during pregnancy. We call the post natal and the pre natal levels: post natal is after, pre natal before. In the prenatal period if the man and the woman had a fight in the fifth month, invariably, and there are enough patients on record, they show up with problems that go right back to that fifth month and in sequence of five numerically, in the every fifth year or every fifth month of the year, some incident comes up and will zero in on a specific part of the anatomy. That psychological anguish registers into the physiology and it feeds back to the memory bank as a problem. Now the therapist has to work with many ways to diagnose it, we may use a Kirilian camera to ascertain the type of shock from the wave around the anatomy and why did the shortage, the appearance of the glow and the color spectrum and then we start zeroing and if the parent is alive, the child can call the parent and validate it. Many times the parents are amazed that their children will ask them what took place at such and such a time in the pregnancy and when the parents tells the child, because the child is already an adult now and it&rsquo;s not afraid to admit itself or look at itself, the child is able to convey to the therapist and then the therapist can match all the data and show why that is there. Now imagine that is only occurring in the present body form and illnesses that are of the prenatal level, there are illnesses that go to the pre-incarnation levels. Since we don&rsquo;t shut off the hearing and life is not lost, we can&rsquo;t lose life, energy is not created or destroyed, it&rsquo;s ever inherent, present, and carries all the memories of it, we can start picking up the connected awareness in the various forms that did not finish their commitment. That&rsquo;s how come the term karma, you pay off every bill, there&rsquo;s no something for nothing in this universe, you may not like it but that&rsquo;s the way it goes. We may live 60 years of our life, hurt many people, and then suddenly come to realize we must make restitution for it and we try our best to make restitution and yet we end up owing five people because those five people may have passed on or gone on to some place where we can&rsquo;t make any restitution to them. The time comes for us to leave out of the frame, there&rsquo;s no unfinished bill, &ldquo;what you sow, you reap.&rdquo; We are put back into the same law again to resolve it, it&rsquo;s not a bad law, it&rsquo;s not something negative, it&rsquo;s that you can&rsquo;t operate a universal force field without setting up certain natural laws for its continuity and the memory bank is locked into it as a reminder like a bill collector to come get it. Psychologically you come back again and now we have different behavior patterns at the psychological level of the memory. We tend to drift away in daydreaming, we tend to hear noises, we get certain fuzzy images while in the midst of looking at things, this is a psychological memory trying to inform you of something that is not complete in yourself. When we don&rsquo;t understand it, we may classify you as a sick person until it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense that you&rsquo;re not really sick, there is something that is not working the way we have been programmed to accept it to work only to find out it&rsquo;s doing its own laws and that we have to get back to understand that this person may be going through a self-healing on their own from their own self-programmed memory bank before they left the last life. They wanted to make restitution, isn&rsquo;t that what I said before? But the five people that are gonna make the restitution aren&rsquo;t there, the unfinished psychological pattern is now trying to come to the surface. So we may end up having all of a sudden a hologrammic view of the room or we may hear that somebody is experimenting with drugs, just for curiosity we may indulge and bang, the whole geometry and geography of the brain suddenly flashes open and we see various images going through us on the psychological level. But there is a danger, the Yogis of the East did not say that drug was not valid, they knew it was there, it would be erroneous to believe that we are so smart today and invent of better drug. Plant has always been here, minerals have always been here, combinations is Man&rsquo;s curiosity. So the drug experience is not a new experience but it&rsquo;s not an experience of looking at the internal memory bank in terms of healthiness simply because it has a residual toxic reaction to the mechanism and it can be out of time. We don&rsquo;t know enough chemistry, what we will call chromo or chrono biology, biology geared to time and the mechanics of how they&rsquo;re time formed, time-related, and how this cellular mechanism is time-related. So we may hurt ourselves more by the chemical induction to look at the memory banks. A few of us may escape it (inaudible), because their timing went off. Yet the wise men knew that the Creator could not put us together, leave us in this peculiar mannerism if It did not intended for us to move on to another level which is a spiritual memory bank, looking at the memory bank from the spiritual level now and tapping into it but must also provide natural means for the tapping in to the memory bank of the spiritual level. 1:00 What good would the Creative Intelligence just make us a biological object and turn us loose and then to conflict ourselves with psychological gains? That would not be a valid thing, the spirituality has to come out of it somewhere and that&rsquo;s what we eventually end up recognizing why the realized Man appears on the scene periodically extolling the spirituality of the memory bank. That&rsquo;s your Divine Nature, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you and the more of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you. They come plugging away at this and they become so adamant at times you think these people are very fanatical that they want you to look inside and get back to that memory bank. The more of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you they go to the extent of making their own personal lives a model of how they tapped in and yet they leave us with simple rules of tapping in so simple at times it makes the intellectual person disgusted by hearing it. It sounds so boring hearing such a simple idea, getting born again but if the intellectual person isn&rsquo;t carried away with this simplicity and looks at it more objectively from a standpoint of terminology and into the physiology of it, then you&rsquo;ll uncover the reality underlying it. Then he will also see that the method though simple is the most natural, for every invention that ever came out, the laws or the ideas underlying it are very simple things when we finally put it together, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that before? You ever heard that statement? And it&rsquo;s so simple, so obvious and yet you miss it. That is why we can&rsquo;t just shut it out, we have to look at it more objectively. Birth is the doorway to the physiological study, all the anatomy makeup is the physiological study, the psychological relationship is the feedback of the unfinished ideas. This is not our first and last time, if it was we don&rsquo;t have to live this way, we can push Mr. Reagan off his seat and sit at his place. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not the first and last time, see? If it&rsquo;s the first time, you can go and do what you want because there&rsquo;s nothing to account for. What is there to account for? If it&rsquo;s the last time, it&rsquo;s over, you might as well be as belligerent as you want to bem obnoxious as you want to be, there&rsquo;s no need to be holy anyplace, you follow? The logic is there but innately you sense it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, regardless of how much programming you have to behave as a rational person, it don&rsquo;t make sense that this is the first and last time because you wouldn&rsquo;t go up and hit the person right like that and push him over and take his place. Deep down inside something is recurring and making you think back, more of that &ldquo;me&rdquo; go in finding out what is hidden waiting to be released. So the psychological aspects of memory don&rsquo;t end with the mere hurts in the present time, they don&rsquo;t end with the prenatal level, they are carryovers from unfinished commitments in various forms that we were in, it&rsquo;s a tough thing to catch up with it. If we all look back at Cain and Abel and Adam and Eve as the first real matrix for this thought pattern of psychological feedback, Adam and Eve their first child was Cain. The second child was Abel, Cain kills Abel then the Creative Intelligence says &ldquo;Vengeance is mine saith the Lord, no man lay a hand on Cain.&rdquo; That mean Mom and Pop can&rsquo;t clobber the hell out of Cain for killing Abel, right? When is Abel going to get any restitution or being absolved for being hurt that way and when is Cain going to have a chance to absolve his mistake if it&rsquo;s the first and last time? The unfinished thought pattern in the life form has to have a form again to carry over to resolve. But you see the timing is thrown off and once timing has thrown off, the whole mechanism is going to be off time and yet the same timing that is thrown off will reconcile itself in a given time but when two people come together for the first time in this present form, there&rsquo;s a sudden recognition and they don&rsquo;t know why. You&rsquo;ve never felt that? Walk in a room and you&rsquo;re seeing someone and you feel you know them but where do you know them from? That psychological part of you is recalling. Now it&rsquo;s here we make the quantum leap into the spiritual, it&rsquo;s at that moment of meeting. We&rsquo;re going to deal with numbers now, a young person and an old person meeting for the first time and the alphabet of the language of saying &ldquo;Hi, hello.&rdquo; These are two people in the room meeting for the first time, A is 60 years of age and B is 30 years of age and A speaks to B and says &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; and B responds &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; Because of their age difference, zeroing on their past life performance we find that their contact in present time is an unfinished commitment to each other in some life form now being resolved. The older person speaking to the younger person is catching up with the unfinished thought patterns and resolutions. If the younger person speaks to the older person, that&rsquo;s B speaks to A and says &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s very hard to validate that it&rsquo;s a past life experience but it can be validated at another level of our mechanism much more closer to our present form. Remember I said losers can&rsquo;t be born, winners are born, but there are many runner-ups and you may have to push one of the runner-ups out of the way to be ahead of the game, &ldquo;Ah! See you next time. My trip not yours but I&rsquo;ll make up for it!&rdquo; &ldquo;You better.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;s swearing at Daddy for performing such an erroneous operation in that mechanism for releasing all these forms of life to battle for survival. And the one that&rsquo;s gone ahead will be older than the one that&rsquo;s left behind to phase out but nature will take care of every form and compensate every form and bring it to face itself on the spiritual level. The spiraling principle within, that&rsquo;s the spiritual life. The one that is left behind gets born again but not in that same form because they are no used ovums, the ovum are only used once so every ovum is a virgin. You see nature plays tricks on us but he plays more tricks on us by labelling it incorrectly. Every ovum is virginal, used once, then the sperms are phased off to go into the laws of recycling and they come back through other body forms and let&rsquo;s say A has gone ahead and left B and A was a caucasian. B was also with A at the time when the battle for survival but A managed to be the one that moved in to become born and went on to be number one. B is left to be cycled out into time and space again and B ends up in an oriental body, way across the continent of another country. 1:10 And 40 years after, A and B are meeting at the congress of international businessmen to discuss computers. In walks B and sees A sitting at the table and says &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; as if to say &ldquo;You remember me?&rdquo; You sense you know him but where do you know him, how do you know him, and suddenly he blasts you with a &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; And he looks so vibrant and you say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just another brash kid.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s that, it may seem as a casual exposure to life but there the spiritual memory bank is working now because if you track down their relationship, you see one younger than the other, and they may end up being so closely thinking of similar ideas that they &ldquo;hit it off&rdquo; as you say. But they can be tracked back to where they separated in time and one going ahead, one left behind to pick up again at the spiritual level to resolve their feelings. At the same time we have another problem at the spermal level. Every ovum is numerically numbered and can be accounted for but the sperms are not so easy to be accounted for in the man because ovum is released every 28 days from the time of menstruation to the time of pregnancy, right or wrong? If it doesn&rsquo;t ovulate in the 28 days, it&rsquo;s phased off for the next, agreed? Good. All right when the woman begins to menstruate at let&rsquo;s say 12 or 12 1/2 to her very first pregnancy and if she counts every month as one, she may end up having menstruated 120 times which will put her in a certain age level for 120 months and if that&rsquo;s her first child, that&rsquo;s 120 in her mechanism. Now picture for one moment this mechanism doesn&rsquo;t have helter skelter operation, everything is synchronized by laws of physics, spirituality, and psychology. &ldquo;Ovum 120 calling sperm 120, come in sperm 120.&rdquo; (Laughter). Then the husband and wife they&rsquo;re there one afternoon and they&rsquo;re looking at each other and they decide they&rsquo;d like to romance each other and lo and behold she&rsquo;s pregnant. Yet he may have released thousands of sperms and she has one ovum to be ovulated and it&rsquo;s ovum 120. Rest assured that sperm 120 got there, pushing all the rest out and he may be the lazy son of a gun, sleeping down on the bottom of everything in the pile heap but he pushed in there to get to the ovum because why? His number is up. (Laughter). Spiritual memory can be very very hilarious and exotic and at the same time very factual but he got there. But by the same token you have another problem there, ovum 121, ovum 119, they are going to be runner-ups with ovum 120, right? And they&rsquo;re gonna give 120 a run for the money. Sometimes the ovum can dilate and have two openings but it&rsquo;s originally a 120 ovum. It can be a 120 dilation being an A and a B part, 120 is destined to go in there but 119 is faster than 121. &ldquo;No greater love than he who would lay down his life for his fellow Man&rdquo; is a saying which we think only applies after we&rsquo;re born. Not valid, it applies before we&rsquo;re born because that&rsquo;s where we are going to find out real trust. 120 innately now it&rsquo;s going to slow down knowing that (inaudible) so a phenomena of twins are going to occur. 120 is supposed to go in first but then it sees 119 is so close and then 119 is recognized by 120. 120 says, &ldquo;Well okay, if the ovum is already opening up for us to come in, then we&rsquo;re going to share the ovum.&rdquo; 120 is going to slow down for 119 to catch up and they both have to merge and lock into the mechanism. It&rsquo;s like a docking device in space between a satellite and the mounting equipment. That docking is the test of 120 to 119 because 120 is giving up preferential position for a coordinate position. &ldquo;No greater love than he would lay down his life for his fellow Man.&rdquo; He knows he&rsquo;s the winner, he knows he&rsquo;s got to take a chance and let this other fellow come in. Now the other fellow may be coming correctly on time to match 120&rsquo;s slowing down and they both merge at the same speed and out comes the twins. At the point of delivery, 120 is going to go out first and 119 is gonna follow in sequence but not always this particular slowing down occurs. &ldquo;No greater love than he who would lay down his life for his fellow Man&rdquo; has its quirks. It&rsquo;s in the timing, 119 may forget his accelerator and flick past 120 a split second too soon. Though it would slow down for him to come in, he didn&rsquo;t regulate his momentum to merge in the ovum. There is where Creative Intelligence plays justice, they lock off, offspring is siamese twins and you will always see one portion of the head a trifle higher than the other and you know who is the culprit. (Laughter). Spiritual law is validated now, spiritual memory bank becomes obvious to you now. What this is all telling us is that our outer life has to be reorganized to resolve these conditions of the memory bank and the memory bank is only the bill to be paid and it&rsquo;s paid on the outer life where you sweat it out. So if you owe a bill and you have to pay it, the physical body is where you work off the bill. Thank you. Audience: Maybe we should have some questions and answers. Does anyone have any questions of Dr. Ley? (Gap in tape). Adano: &hellip;programming, also there is the tape deck replay when you&rsquo;re asleep for increasing the memory. The thing is this, the memory banks of the brain are all over your cells, every cell is a memory bank. There&rsquo;s no way you can escape it but they are assigned specific operations in various parts of the anatomy. Your eye is assigned to see here but that doesn&rsquo;t say this cell here doesn&rsquo;t have the same capacity to perform that function. It does but it&rsquo;s not assigned to do it right now until called upon. We are a reflection, that&rsquo;s how reflexology came into existence as a way of touching different reflexes and getting the same response. We are a reflection of this whole cosmic makeup and we are a walk-in memory bank, more of it is what you want to release but it&rsquo;s knowing where to tap in so you can get the use of it. Since the brain nutritionally is set to release memory, nutrition is already organized to nurture it and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so important about nutrition and the type of minerals that are necessary for the brain to function efficiently. 1:20 They say an elephant has a memory that he never forgets, right? If you follow an elephant and see what it feeds on and the type of minerals that are in the plant that it eats, the food is mostly Gota Kola. It&rsquo;s the plant that they eat a lot and the minerals are very high in germanium which is a very small crystal that is found in the lobes of the brain that has to do with communication, you use them a lot in your computer work. But we don&rsquo;t get enough of that in our normal diet, they&rsquo;re trace minerals, we have to reinforce it so we reinforce it in our regular eating by taking the Gota Kola or we can take the Ginseng, another root and we take Inositol, that&rsquo;s an extract and it enhances the memory bank. Now certain foods are assigned by nature for the brain, high in phosphorus which the brain needs, you find that in marine life. Now it&rsquo;s strange that in a marine life there&rsquo;s a high concentration of phosphorus in their mechanism yet when you look at yourself we may pride ourselves as being mammals at this stage of the evolutionary law but were we not marine life before we started off? We made the transition from marine to mammal but we are slowly phasing it down in place of preference. Now you want to store data, you want to accumulate more data, that&rsquo;s a preferential condition at the demand point but what is already stored, you&rsquo;re ignoring. To get more in is to make associations, you can remember data faster by associating it. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. All right there are nine numerals, zero is the exceptional numeral that can be cut and put into shape to make all nine, you follow me so far? If you take the zero, it can make one, it can make two, it can make three, four, in any shape. Here&rsquo;s a zero, cut it in half and you got one. You twist it this way you have two. You twist it this way you have three. You twist it this way you have four. You twist it this way you have five. You twist it this way you have six. You twist it this way you have seven. You twist it this way you have eight. And you twist it this way and you have nine. The same zero did that. Alright, we don&rsquo;t seem to have any more numerals to work with, right? We are confined to these 10 numbers. In the english language we are confined to 26 letters yet the same zero can make all 26 letters. From the way I showed you how to start from one to nine, you can go through the same mechanics of taking the zero and making the 26 letters. To store only that in the brain and command a vocabulary to communicate is fantastic when you realize what a computer you have but it&rsquo;s the association patterns that make it unique, how you associate with it. If you take one to nine and you put a letter under each of it, the first nine letters will what? One is A, B is 2, C is 3, D is 4, right? E is 5, F is 6, G is 7, H is 8, and I is nine. Now remember the first and last letters are A and I, one and nine. When you look at your hand you&rsquo;ve got the computer all set up already. Now if you take the next nine letters, J will be under A and under 1, and R will be under I which is under nine, count it up. JKLMNOPQR. See how fast you got it? 2 times 9 that&rsquo;s 18 already, there only 26, you need eight more. So S will fall under J so AJS is 1. Z will fall under 8, it will not fall under nine so you have I-R as the last two letters, A-J as the first two letter, and the bottom line is S-Z, then every one is only three of each and if you had that put out in front of you now, you have a framework of a computer module working in your brain now and then the interplay of numbers and letters sets up the communication and sets up the coordinates and associations. And if you&rsquo;re going to read any subject, you&rsquo;re going to deal with the letters of the alphabet. Let&rsquo;s say take the word cat C-A-T cat. Taking from your framework C is the third letter right? A is the first so on a computer that would be 3-1 and where will T be? Two, exactly. That&rsquo;s very good because you see you&rsquo;ve already got the framework of reference that you can now plot out memory retention for data and surprise the teacher because if you start reading data, you&rsquo;re going to be reading words because they&rsquo;re only a combination of letters to represent ideas but they&rsquo;re also going to be numbers in their context so since we&rsquo;re always thinking numbers and letters, it&rsquo;s faster to pull it together as a computer now and utilize our germanium mineral chip that we have here that everybody&rsquo;s trying to copy and utilize it quicker. So you can start zeroing in on more data faster by the association. All right let&rsquo;s say now you saw the word &ldquo;caterpillar&rdquo; and if you want to make the association then you have &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and &ldquo;pillar.&rdquo; A pillar is a post and the cat is an animal and the cat is supposed to be able to scratch and a pillar is a very heavy thing standing upright and if you get a caterpillar, it can be either the worm you&rsquo;re inferring or the machinery that is digging up the ground, you&rsquo;re making your own association from the word. So we started off using the word memory, m-e-m-o-r-y or ME-MOR-Y. Various associations open doors for you and the more you can associate, the more you retain the data and the more use you have for the data. That would be your best approach in speeding up and retaining by association plus the nutrition where you can enhance the memory bank. 1:30 Now I&rsquo;m going to ask you a crazy question. You study and memorize, what time of the day you find it very easy to memorize? Now we&rsquo;re talking timing now. Morning, good. Do you know why, what time in the morning, from when to when? Audience: I don&rsquo;t know exactly when, it just feels better in the morning. After six and before 11. Adano: You&rsquo;re dealing with your spleen which is very close to your adrenals and memory is always related to adrenal action and in the acupuncture principles, we have to know the timing of every organ, it&rsquo;s high tide and it&rsquo;s low tide. That means its constriction/dilation behavior and the lungs operate between three and five AM for maximum operation of oxygen. People who have lung diseases usually die in lung time from congestion of the lungs but the problem is always observed to have occurred years ago in the bladder, the direct organ opposite to the lungs. Now people who have a problem with memory since that is a spleen time close to the adrenals, usually have problems with their pericardium. Any constriction in the throat as a child would shut down the memory bank therefore the tendency to remember gets slower because of the constriction in the thyroid. Now if you now the tonsils and thyroid operate exactly between seven and nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening which is exactly opposite to the spleen which is between nine to eleven. So nine to eleven in the morning is the spleen and nine to eleven in the evening would be the thyroid and tonsils combination. In the evening time between 9 and 11, how do you feel? Audience: Usually the best I would say. It varies but I&rsquo;ve always been kind of a late person. Adano: But you feel high, more high, more alert? Audience: Right. Adano: But towards morning you don&rsquo;t feel as much. Good, that&rsquo;s because the organ being removed has shifted the frequencies now forcing the memory banks to compensate so you would do best in retaining all your data by studying between that time in the evening instead of trying to force it in the morning on the organ that is not going to be able to compensate for it. See because that area is removed in that part of the anatomy, then when you want to sit down and study data that that would be the time because then you&rsquo;ll take a full advantage of that condition and therefore you retain your information and you&rsquo;re ready for next morning. But if you try to sit down in the morning to catch up with it, you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;re not recalling as fast and you&rsquo;re slowing down too quick, that would be the problem but you have a way now to validate and help yourself to retain because the brain will synchronize. See the lung works between three and five AM and the brain is not functional without the lungs but the tonsils were removed, they are above the lungs. Now 9 to 11 PM is the tonsils time. 11 to 1 is the gallbladder time and 1 to 3 is the liver time and 3 to 5 is the lung time so you see tonsil is ahead of lung time. 5 to 7 is the large intestine time. 7 to 9 is the stomach time and 9 to 11, again opposite, is the spleen time which is closely related to where the adrenals are. So your memory will not pick up in the morning for the deficiency of the missing area in the throat. To compensate for that, you go into that very area that has been removed and work in that time zone, that&rsquo;s how the cosmic engineer figured out a long time ago to make compensation and then give it dreams to fellows like psychics and seers so we call it now cosmic healing or spiritual healing. Audience: How have these times been regulated and how have they been discovered? Adano: By sick people. (Laughter). Let me show you. There is a medicine now being recognized as very very potent for cancer and it&rsquo;s called platinum chloride. It was discovered by Dr. Horesky who has done the research in the last four years and applied it to his patients of cancer. When platinum chloride is administered before 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, every patient recovered and went home. When it was administered after 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, everyone died the next day from pneumonia. The records are on file now because this is what started the concept of chrono biology research because chrono is the time and the biological reaction to time and the chemical they were using was platinum chloride. When administered at the wrong time, this the organs did different things. When administered at a certain time, they did a different thing and they&rsquo;re finding that more and more now that when they go back to the medical records when people die versus when they live in relation to a certain disease, what organs were in relationship. And the lungs would collapse and fill up and they don&rsquo;t function properly and just get congested more and more and they die. One cannot say they died from cancer because the death recordings, they die from pneumonia in the lungs and this is on record now, they&rsquo;re doing a lot of testing on it so they have already established the record or the time lapse for each organ, the twelve major organs of the body and the periods in which these organs operate to their relationships to each other in terms of communication and feedback. So it&rsquo;s established already, lung time is from 3 am to 5 am but by the same token apart from this research, Man gets his dreams or his inspirations between that time. You read of any invention that has been discovered, they always seem to get it in the early morning like a dream flashing through their mind in the early morning between three and five and then when you check out the anatomy for the actual rhythms of the blood, the organ that is absorbing minerals in transport between three and five are minerals that are going to feed the (inaudible) of the lungs. Therefore the Yogis in the East now usually get up at nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening to meditate, right or wrong? Wrong, they get up between three and five in the morning before the sun comes up and sit in meditation, communion. This has often been known in the Yogic science as the God time, the lung time, the time when the mechanism is synchronized to function in rhythm with its health. In the turning on of this internal mechanism, we can check now various diseases of what we call hypo or hyper. Diseases that are hyper are going too fast in the organism. Diseases that are hypo are going too slow and they can be tracked right back to the breathing which regulates the respiratory flow and the distribution of the blood to the heart. Once the breathing is off and it&rsquo;s going too fast, you have a hyper condition. If it&rsquo;s going too slow, you have a hypo condition. Now high blood pressure is associated with fast breathing, it&rsquo;s not associated with slow breathing and low blood pressure is associated with slow breathing, see? So the pressure and the breathing are interrelated and it can be checked out over and over so patients that have a high pressure, what we try to do with them now is to reorganize their breathing, bringing them back and clocking them and then they clock back to the exact time, they normalize then whatever toxicity you have that is rationally taken off by nutrition and exercise. 1:40 Audience: Is there a way to develop your abilities to perceive what is wrong (inaudible) by your aura or vibe? Adano: Yes there is ways by concentration but the Kirilian camera is your validation, you can work with both. You need both in today&rsquo;s understanding that you can take a picture of the person&rsquo;s outline of the body and get the actual corona of the energy field. A healthy tissue where the minerals are being delivered by the blood on time to the organ, (inaudible). If the organ is starving you&rsquo;re going to feel a funny sensation in it and you may think you&rsquo;ve got all kinds of weird sensations and it&rsquo;s simply deficiency of transportation. So let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a deficiency towards this part of the anatomy, in the corona of the energy field it will diminish and the overload will show up. So one part of the whole corona will be wide and one will be flattened in and the rest will be uniform. Years ago we never knew how to read it, those who were able to read it began to understand it better but those who didn&rsquo;t know how to read it made a lot of mistakes and often gave the wrong information. But by the same token, if you don&rsquo;t have a camera to see, the hand is a sensor and you can pass the hands over the entire body and follow the corona and you&rsquo;ll feel where it bulges and where it dips. Also you will feel the shift in the temperature because you are a module of this whole universal principle from sonics right down to crystalline and you have a temperature ratio and a delivery time through this entire fluid system. So that when you pass your hand, the different areas of the body will have different heat or temperature so you&rsquo;ll often hear &ldquo;cold feet warm heart, cold heart hot feet.&rdquo; Yet we didn&rsquo;t realize what we were saying now, it&rsquo;s measurable and in terms of psychological behavior from a memory bank it&rsquo;s happening, the memory that will trigger that condition right there. But first again in order to pass your hand or check it, you the therapist has to learn how to breathe because if you don&rsquo;t breathe correctly, you&rsquo;ll be reading incorrectly. So the first person to work on is on yourself regulating your respiratory rate. It&rsquo;s like a car, the battery is run down, you turn it and turn it, it don&rsquo;t start up. You get a car that comes over and you flag him down and say &ldquo;hi, you want to give me a jump?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah I gotta jumper cable.&rdquo; Now if he makes the mistake of not turning on his engine to let it run and then give you a jump from his battery to your battery, you drain him off, familiar experience? Good, okay, same law applies, no different, ou see? First put yourself in order then you can relate otherwise you&rsquo;ll get drained off, that&rsquo;s no fault of the other person. Audience: If you can sense it by feeling, how do you then develop the ability to perceive in another way to change it from the feeling of it to be being it or perceiving it? I understand that there are people who can look at someone&hellip; Adano: Yes, put it this way. There are those who can see but cannot feel. They are those who can feel and cannot see. There are those who can hear and cannot see nor feel. It depends on what level of evolution you&rsquo;re in the playback of your growth you&rsquo;re in. &ldquo;Blessed is he you can see, feel, touch, and hear&rdquo; and let alone smell, that&rsquo;s what we call total memory now. Each one of those abilities have a name: psychometry, clairvoyance, and everything, they all have different labels for their abilities but the realized person has the total spectrum working for the first time in him, he has the total memory. So he not only sees but he feels and hears and smells and can taste, that&rsquo;s why you first got to put yourself in order. It&rsquo;s like a doctor, he can&rsquo;t be a doctor if you don&rsquo;t go take his training first. So equally a psychotherapist or a parapsychological therapist should first train himself in the parapsychological laws then he can go and function. To merely have the ability and try to work with it is not enough, you need to improve upon it, you need to know more about it and then you will competent with it and so you evolve through the different levels of it. Again at certain age level, the full spectrum opens up. Full spectrum awareness occurs between 30 to 35 in the first phase of a person&rsquo;s evolution. Now if he doesn&rsquo;t accomplish it within 30 to 35, the second phase of full spectrum of consciousness is 45 to 65. Now if he doesn&rsquo;t accomplish between that second phase then he&rsquo;s got one more opportunity, 80 to 100 on. That&rsquo;s why some records show individuals to have a late illumination in that awareness and others have an early illumination and the majority falls in the middle. Now depending on how old you are now and trying to shift over, it&rsquo;s like trying to say to yourself &ldquo;I just got pregnant today, I want the baby tomorrow.&rdquo; (Laughter). You personally have to go through certain psycho physiological changing and cleansing routines on your own mechanism to evaluate and let it occur. So it&rsquo;s not something that you can push, it&rsquo;s something you have to let mature within but you will get it. It&rsquo;s there for you, you know you may not know at which one of the three levels you&rsquo;re in for it to mature out so don&rsquo;t let that bother you, all you have to do is go on in and it will come out. I&rsquo;ll say this is how it happened to me. Paramahansa Yogananda was my teacher at the time in the body, I wrote to him and I said &ldquo;I would like to buy a hundred books on God.&rdquo; Realizing that the man was a fantastic spiritual teacher, I was still writing him a letter like that and saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to buy a hundred books on God.&rdquo; That shows you how uninformed I am of what God is but he writes back and says &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the books,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s how he puts it &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the books in comparison to 15 minutes silence in the Soul.&rdquo; Well to this day I can say it took me 20 years to accomplish 15 minutes silence in the Soul. When I accomplished it, I realized what he was saying that I couldn&rsquo;t push these phenomenas or these capabilities. That the maturing time, like the seed is planted in me, and this length of time would be required for it to mature into a fruit that I could use it and work with it, do you see? So you may not know where in your memory bank you left off and when is it going to come to the surface for you to have the ability to apply but if you keep going in and applying the techniques that you learn to look inside, you will eventually bring it to the surface. 1:50 Audience: Did I hear you say earlier that you had a death experience? Adano: Well I was helping a friend fix a TV antenna in Canada and it was on his mother&rsquo;s house, a three-story building in Canada. The rain had fallen in the afternoon and wet the balcony, the balconies are made of wood, and while pulling on the cable I was wearing what you would call one of those running shoes and it was smooth and while pulling on the cable I slipped, crashed into the balcony rail, and the balcony rail broke and I&rsquo;m coming 30 feet down. Well being a student of meditative life, I says &ldquo;Oh boy&rdquo; but again the brain starts to calculate so fast in terms of physics, you know the speed of acceleration is 32 feet per second per second and I&rsquo;m going to fall 30 feet, already making all these surveying measurements. The brain comes telling me during that traveling time &ldquo;If you hit the ground, you will be dead if you don&rsquo;t veer off from the concrete.&rdquo; I took my left foot and kicked the wall as I was sliding coming down, I could reach this part of the wall and veered and I landed on the solid earth that was wet from the rain, not the concrete. I went back years after my operation and healed myself, I went back to see the house and I knew how that walkway was. I was exactly six inches away from the concrete, full embodied into the earth, and the police then at the time they came because they had to call them. You know you fall down and here&rsquo;s a phenomenon of your mechanism, I fell I hit the ground yet I felt no pain. You tell someone you didn&rsquo;t feel any pain they look at you kind of funny falling 30 feet? Well I met a woman who fell 100 feet, got up and walked away, all she had was a sprained ankle but you don&rsquo;t feel any pain. In my body I felt no pain, I landed on my back but when I tried to get up, none of the parts will coordinate yet the sensation of hitting the ground is like if you&rsquo;re playing with your friend and you roll on the floor, that&rsquo;s all the sensation. And yet when I try to put pressure on the ankle to lift the entire body, put the pressure on the wrist or the elbow, there is no coordination and I can&rsquo;t move. Then my friend comes down and I says to him &ldquo;I think I must have something gone wrong in my mechanism.&rdquo; He was a lawyer, he said the quickest way for them to get any help is to call the police, don&rsquo;t call anybody else, just call the police and they&rsquo;ll get an ambulance. So he called the Mounted Police and the ambulance is coming. In the meantime my body is getting numb, cold numb from the toe up, this is how I discovered we never die from the head down, we die from our feet up and years after I validated the research, we die from our feet up. Nature has made all these wonderful precautions and stored them in a memory bank. All right I&rsquo;m shutting down aggressively from the foot up and the body becoming numb, just like somebody gave you a novocaine you know and it&rsquo;s a slow gradually shutting down. Yet the brain is still functioning and saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let the numbness pass your eyes otherwise you&rsquo;ll be dead.&rdquo; Well what do you do to stop numbness? There again memory comes back, picture your brain you have to say &ldquo;what do I do, what do I do?&rdquo; And then here comes the picture flashing through my brain, a cowboy falls off a horse and he&rsquo;s shot in the body, that&rsquo;s a picture that I&rsquo;m seeing and how is he going to help this cowboy by giving him something to bite so he can take the bullet out and it&rsquo;s like seeing an old cowboy movie and the knife is being heated up and this cowboy is biting on a bullet. Well that comes to my mind, &ldquo;bite,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the message &ldquo;bite.&rdquo; So I reached around for my hands, they&rsquo;re numb, but knowing my anatomy this is the ascending side and this is the descending side, don&rsquo;t bite the descending side because you&rsquo;ll shut it off, bite the ascending side of the body. So I put the&hellip; and start biting down on the right thumb which is a direct signal to the lung meridian to the brain. Instantly the numbness stopped right at this point, the tip of the nose. It began to recede, the harder I bite&hellip; when I started to bite I felt no sensation but when I felt the first sensation then it stopped and then I bite harder and harder. In fact sometimes you don&rsquo;t even know how hard you&rsquo;re biting until after you look and examine it, how much power you exerted and pressure of the bite to leave a mark on the finger and it receded all the way down and stopped here, it never went any further than the heart, would not go below the rib cage, it stopped right here. I&rsquo;m conscious, fully conscious, no sensation of pain but totally anesthetized like a tooth in your mouth from a dentist. That&rsquo;s my switch, if I pull away the finger it starts coming back again up so you&rsquo;re lying in a precarious position. In the meantime what is going on in my head, when I hit the ground I went out of my body, I had out of body experiences but not in this manner where you&rsquo;re thrown out and you&rsquo;re looking at yourself lying down and you&rsquo;re looking yourself outside and then all around you are your favorite friends of the highest order to the lowest order looking at you. You say &ldquo;Are you dead?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I in hell?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you in heaven?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are here.&rdquo; But funny enough those of a high caliber of consciousness that you may relate to, it&rsquo;s easier for you to feel them. And those of a lower consciousness that you might have known, it&rsquo;s harder to feel them. There seems to be an insulation between you and them in the memory banks and the closer you look to those&hellip; I saw all the great Masters but they were so fluidic and then I saw myself in all of them, then I realized that the Creative Intelligence became me. It&rsquo;s at that time I realized that experience but then I also saw in the same tunnel of experience the decisive moment of dying and leaving this present body or the option. Then you realize there&rsquo;s only one time in your life that you have an option, no other time in your life you might ever have an option, is at death. The option is at death, not at birth because that prepares you for the next birth. The option at death prepares you for the next birth. I saw the body of a woman in Africa about to have a baby, it&rsquo;s gonna be a boy, his destiny was to become a businessman and run his father&rsquo;s business and study in America, that&rsquo;s the destiny of it, that was waiting. The option is my broken body and a whole series of faces waiting with hands like that, like the tail of a kite and they&rsquo;re all on the end of the tail like that, and that&rsquo;s the option with the broken body and the pain. Now if I phase out, the cord that connects the body to the Soul nature will shut off like an umbilical cord and I will be born into the invisible, that would be my birthday into the invisible, you call it death. They will put away my mechanism or cremate it but that would be my birthday to the invisible. I went to the invisible mechanism of the body waiting for me to merge and come out and live out that karma or take up by volunteering this broken mechanism with all these faces attached to it as an unfinished residual obligation to work with it. Well judging from the faces of all the realized Ones and even Jesus, how are you going to answer a thing like that? They don&rsquo;t talk with their mouths, they talk with their eyes, and it has nothing to do with intellect, it has do with your heart, they penetrate your heart so deeply with Their eyes that what is it all about? The universe is for love but not to be in love with it because the moment you say you&rsquo;re in love with it, your program out of love and you&rsquo;re gonna fall out. You&rsquo;ll have incidences to go in and out of it but if you say &ldquo;love&rdquo; and you feel it, this is what they call the compassionate nature starts to emerge out of your memory bank. Creative Life is Creative Love already locked up in you and all the loved ones that have gone ahead, they so loved the world that they enter into it. 2:00 And if you read a statement they say &ldquo;God so loved the world He gave his only begotten son&rdquo; meaning that consciousness out of creativeness loves Its manifestation that It will constantly merge Itself into Its manifestation for the benefit of Its manifestation. So you begin to realize what a fantastic process of God&rsquo;s love is embodied (inaudible), coming in, you can&rsquo;t evade it no more, it&rsquo;s not a mind thing no more, it&rsquo;s not a brain, it&rsquo;s heart. The heart begins to pulsate for the first time. Well I could feel the beat, then I said &ldquo;Okay, I accept my body&rdquo; and I found myself slipping back into the body, no pain. By that time the ambulance arrived and they&rsquo;re already coming up and they got me in the ambulance and the comedy of it is that the siren can kill you more than anything else, the drone on that siren to get people out of the way could kill you because at that level your sense of hearing transcends every other sensory function you have. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw Superman 3, the little boy says &ldquo;I love you, I love you.&rdquo; The sense of hearing got through to Superman to make him fight off his delusions about himself, the pictures are catching up with the truth. The sense of hearing is the connected link all the time. I can hear these people talking but I&rsquo;m paying no attention to them, I&rsquo;m trying to get my mind centered from the siren and the siren is drowning them out. We arrive at the hospital and they&rsquo;re hauling me out of the stretcher and another comes out, this beautiful nurse all starched up with a big pad, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, what do you do?&rdquo; She was trying to get all this data from me and intern looks and says &ldquo;Nurse, this man is dying. He doesn&rsquo;t have time to answer questions.&rdquo; Now here again Creative Intelligence is organizing your life. I&rsquo;m meeting with people but faces were glimmers in the experience of falling and the timing is so intricate that every second, every happening, every individual is synchronizing with the timing. I have to sit back now and watch and not interfere because I&rsquo;m taking notation of this process. I&rsquo;m in the emergency room, I hear the elevator open up and comes down, out steps an elderly gentleman and he is a doctor and he is looking at these men working and then he said to one of the interns &ldquo;this man is dying&rdquo; and he took away the instrument and stuck it under the ribs to deflate the lungs. I looked up, but you don&rsquo;t feel anything because you&rsquo;re so numb already and he said &ldquo;young man normally I don&rsquo;t come down this elevator but tonight the other one didn&rsquo;t work and I was forced to come down this one.&rdquo; Now in his mind that&rsquo;s his conviction, in my mind synchronous timing on the memory bank of the blueprint pulling the pieces together in the jigsaw puzzle but you have to let it happen. And he says &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, everything will be all right&rdquo; and the face changes and it&rsquo;s the superimposition of all the great Saints are passing through. He may not see it but I&rsquo;m there looking at this kaleidoscope of how this thing&hellip; Who is talking or who is sensing what he&rsquo;s saying? He may in his logical mind say (inaudible) but again something deep inwardly is interacting for the consolation for me to relate to. That memory bank is assuring me that this is part of the process I&rsquo;m going through so my logical mind must take temporary suspension and let the intuitive mind flow. Then my memory banks began to open up more, I never knew there where so many memory banks to open because faces that began to come in the room become like if I knew them before, they just start flipping up and I can see into the various objects, it was just starting to flow back. Then he said to me &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;thank you doctor&rdquo; and he walked away. I owned a business at that time and several people depended on me and I had to open to place the next morning at around seven o&rsquo;clock to let them go to work. So you can imagine my mental quandary realizing I&rsquo;m in a hospital and then they gave me an injection to put me to sleep, telling me that I&rsquo;m going to be all right, and this is Wednesday night at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I had to open up at 7 o&rsquo;clock on a Thursday. The quandary of my mind is in various ways, how it shuts off and tried to interject but then I said &ldquo;No, he said that it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay. Live the words.&rdquo; This is how the consciousness comes into me. So I began to picture a clock in front of me and as I said to the man last night &ldquo;always set up your programs for coming back, otherwise you lock yourself out into the non-verbal level and you can&rsquo;t return.&rdquo; So I started the clock, in the room all the people are working but I&rsquo;m looking at this big clock and designing it and there&rsquo;s the long arm pointing at 12 and a short arm pointing at 7 and I&rsquo;m looking at it mentally, visualizing it, and I&rsquo;m trying to merge my whole entire (inaudible) and let go now of holding back any sensation and go into the unconscious. I&rsquo;m gone, believing in that state I&rsquo;m sound asleep, enjoying a wonderful night&rsquo;s rest, waking up tomorrow morning to go run my business, see how illusions can be great, how desires can be fantastic? In my brain all of a sudden &ldquo;ring ring ring ring, seven o&rsquo;clock, ring ring ring ring, seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; You ever set an alarm clock to go to the airport, you even get up before it rings? The phenomena of memory, the phenomenon of the will to integrate with it and the timing. I open my eyes and then I&rsquo;m hearing all of a sudden on the left hand side, &ldquo;Well if he don&rsquo;t die now, he ain&rsquo;t gonna die.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Who the hell is dying?&rdquo; When I did realize what had happened, where I was, I was strapped up like a chicken on a spit with all kind of equipment running through me and here I am like this. And I look and I see my friend sitting there, the lawyer, and all the doctors were standing in the corner making the comment that I was going to die. And I said &ldquo;Hey man, isn&rsquo;t this Thursday morning seven o&rsquo;clock? What are you doing in my house?&rdquo; Do you see how your brain works? He says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the hospital and it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock Saturday afternoon.&rdquo; And to me all I could remember is that I went to sleep and got up at 7 o&rsquo;clock Thursday morning and he&rsquo;s validating that it&rsquo;s not seven o&rsquo;clock Thursday morning and you&rsquo;re not in your house, you&rsquo;re in the hospital strung out and it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock saturday afternoon. Well I&rsquo;m gathering my senses again and I&rsquo;m starting to feel woozy again and I said &ldquo;Okay, thank you.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow morning, ten o&rsquo;clock okay? I&rsquo;m going to go to bed.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll take care of the business for you.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sound asleep and ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning is the real pincher of my experience now. I can hear inside my consciousness &ldquo;wake up, wake up&rdquo; and I open my eyes and there&rsquo;s the doctor standing there. I see he&rsquo;s getting ready an injection needle and I said, &ldquo;Doc, what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Well young man, you had a very very serious accident and you don&rsquo;t realize it. I&rsquo;m just going to give you a brief rundown of your problem.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; 2:10 He says &ldquo;You fell off a building. According to the report from the police, it was 30 feet and according to all the X-rays you have 50 compound fractures which is a total of 94 breaks, that&rsquo;s number two. Number three, you&rsquo;re coming out of a deep comatic stage where your whole body is going to be racked in pain and you&rsquo;re going to need some sedation every hour on the hour to get you through the pain.&rdquo; And I looked at him and says, &ldquo;No doc, I don&rsquo;t want no drugs with my body.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m banking on memory banks of martial art training, banking on Yoga training, and all the different previous physical training to go tell a doctor his knowledge that I don&rsquo;t want the drug in my body. He says &ldquo;Mr. Ley you don&rsquo;t understand your predicament.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;No doctor, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Okay, we don&rsquo;t force but nurse if ever this man cries out that he wants it, administer it. If he doesn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Now here&rsquo;s the comment, he walks away and she looks at me and she says, &ldquo;You doggone Orientals, you think you&rsquo;re tough, eh?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that nurse, I just don&rsquo;t want drugs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait and see buddy&rdquo; and she walked off. Well it didn&rsquo;t take too long, the pain starts to unreel itself. It&rsquo;s like a tape now, the tape recorder now, where&rsquo;s the pain really coming from? Is it the pain so much from the break, that could be valid. Or is it pain from a memory bank that I might have hurt someone in previous lives and trying to reconcile, now I&rsquo;m paying the bill, it&rsquo;s been dumped on me. So the pain is coming up and I said &ldquo;How do you fight pain?&rdquo; Again the image comes back, bite something. Remember when I said I bit on my hand? Well I&rsquo;m strapped up and you can&rsquo;t bite much now, all you got is the pillow and I&rsquo;m biting (Adano makes biting sounds). My face is starting to perspire, I&rsquo;m getting red and the nurse comes along and says &ldquo;Mr. Ley&hellip;&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m battling with her and she&rsquo;s still upset and I&rsquo;m battling with this. Well this goes on for a long while, I&rsquo;m perspiring and she has to come and change the sheets and I&rsquo;m groaning and grunting but I&rsquo;m not giving in and they say &ldquo;you got to go through it.&rdquo; I said to myself &ldquo;If the Creative Intelligence does exist and He puts me here and I can&rsquo;t go through it, then I give up. But if He does exist and I&rsquo;ve had enough evidence that He&rsquo;s existing already and I selected, I volunteered for the frame, I could have been in the mother&rsquo;s tummy right now but here in this frame I volunteered to go through it so shut up. Let the pain work itself out.&rdquo; Your own endorphins come to your rescue but not before. These fellas are very smart, they&rsquo;re like what you call the Spanish inquisitors, they wait to see how long you&rsquo;ll put up with it then they&rsquo;ll give you a relief. Well I fought and fought and eventually the room started to darken and the walls narrowed out and I saw a figure coming on, I thought it was a nun walking towards me but it turned out to be an image of the person like the Virgin Mother that I used to see in the Catholic churches. But when the the person came right up to the bed, the eyes were closed and in that posture, what you call the pronam posture and this really means &ldquo;the God in me bows to the God in you.&rdquo; But the eyes are closed and I&rsquo;m saying in my mind &ldquo;Please open your eyes&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m biting. Eventually the eyes open because that&rsquo;s how they communicate, they don&rsquo;t communicate with their mouth on that level, it&rsquo;s always eye to eye, eyes are the windows of the Soul, eyes are the communicating. And it sends the message that signals into your mechanism and it&rsquo;s like somebody turning on your own memory bank and letting it play, the eye hits your eye, it&rsquo;s fixed the frame in the back of the head like how you fix your tape here to replay and zing, it&rsquo;s playing inside and you&rsquo;re getting the message and the message is simply this, &ldquo;You will be well but not dramatically.&rdquo; The moment that was said I can feel the pain shifting down from my forehead but at the same time, the image of the person is diminishing. As they gradually diminish, the pain is diminishing. When it passed my mouth and it went to the foot and the image is already gone and the pain is already&hellip; I let out a yell &ldquo;I am well.&rdquo; This is four hours after and the nurse and everybody comes running &ldquo;Oh this crazy guy again. You must be busted up&rdquo; and then they look at me. &ldquo;I am well doctor, I&rsquo;m well.&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t believe his eyes. They take a measurement, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; Organically, functionally, everything is back on timing except the bones. If the bones went back and locked in to their normal point of reference and fused, that would be the dramatics, I could have walked off the bed right there. So that karma I had to work through for a very good reason, it would allow me to learn what is the rational therapies and the rational memory relationships and the rational logistics of today&rsquo;s thinking by lying in that bed for almost a year and a half in a cast, getting the knowledge of how body, mind, and spirit relates. So I was getting my basic education in one of the hardest possible ways but there was no pain in the body no more from that time but the bones healed up eventually and I was able to leave. Audience: We want to thank Dr. Adano Ley very much for giving us a most insightful and provocative and inspiring presentation this morning and I thank you all for your presence and your questions and there are some refreshments now so please let us have some refreshments and you can visit with Dr. Adano Ley. (General conversation then gap in tape). Adano: &hellip;over the centuries and where you are so we need to be able to establish it. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. There is a great teacher who goes around in this country, he&rsquo;s still alive and when we met at that time I was in Tyler. He walked through the door, he and his wife, and he looked at me and he said, &ldquo;Hello brother of 150,000 lives.&rdquo; He counted the actual amount of incarnations he knew me and that&rsquo;s how far his memory was able to track back. He met many other people but they were all saying the same thing, we don&rsquo;t meet because of some commitment, we meet because of a communion to put ourselves back into the stream of the unity of life. That&rsquo;s why in the church it&rsquo;s called Holy Communion, it&rsquo;s not a holy commitment. Audience: I believe in the communion of the Saints. Adano: &ldquo;I believe in the communion of the Saints.&rdquo; Right. Audience: So what did Master Yogananda mean when he said that 25% was taken by the Master and 50% grace and the other 25% by the student, the devotee? I read that in Swami Kriyananda&rsquo;s book and I don&rsquo;t quite comprehend it. 2:20 Adano: God is a total memory bank and whatever you do is stored up there waiting to be presented as a bill. That will bankrupt you in any incarnation if the bill is presented. Even before you got out of the womb, the bill would bankrupt you, you follow? So only 50% of the bill is presented to you in each incarnations, you follow so far? Ok. The other 50% of that bill would be very very traumatic if no one would vouch for you. So if you have a credit rating and you have a master charge, that allows you to hold credit, you&rsquo;ve got a 25% credit rating. So that individual is a sort of a voucher but you still got to work out the load and you&rsquo;re only going to work out 25% of the load because the mechanism cannot take the full 100% let alone the full 50%, it can only handle 25 percent. Last night when we were discussing the avenues of meditation I said there are three: one the mantra that we repeat, two the breathing, and three a contact with some human being who may intimate or be in your presence for that moment and remind you of yourself and that meditation is road in. That&rsquo;s the 25%, that&rsquo;s the master charge, that&rsquo;s the credit card, somebody gave you the credit card now go ahead use it but it allows you time to pay your bills. Otherwise the bill is every second. You see because you&rsquo;re dealing with energy and energy must be compensated in terms of momentum so if you&rsquo;re thrown out into a body form to live out unfinished memory banks and have to pay off moment-to-moment, you don&rsquo;t have a chance to live, right? You see they&rsquo;re piling up too fast. So it&rsquo;s what you call &ldquo;toned down&rdquo; to a 25% ratio allowing you 75% to catch up. So it&rsquo;s like you owe the bill and they say &ldquo;All right, you pay next month.&rdquo; So you work this whole month to catch up to pay the bill but you couldn&rsquo;t get that credit rating unless somebody vouched for it or you had some good credit rating built up already and that&rsquo;s basically what that point of reference is in meditation. You may have done a lot of mantra, that&rsquo;s storing it up as an accruable bank account. You might have done a lot of breathing that&rsquo;s an accruable bank account and periodically you might have met some person who could vouch that you&rsquo;re a good guy or say you&rsquo;re a doggone scum. Whoever that person that could vouch for you will have some credit rating in your references so you come back having to work it out. So sometimes when you meet people through your life, whoever you feel a compassionate urge for (inaudible) to forgive them for being harsh to you, that&rsquo;s a sort of credit rating building up in your favor. Anytime you can be flexible enough to be a little compassionate than to be belligerent right away because somebody hurt you, you&rsquo;re building up the credit rating for a human contact now who carries a greater credit rating from having realized themselves to some extent and then coming into your time focus as a communion to validate &ldquo;Well hi, carry on, you&rsquo;re credit rating is okay.&rdquo; Audience: Is there such a thing as a memory bank of mankind. You were talking about research and advances in research and technology, versus an individual memory bank? Adano: Yes, no, maybe. I give you an example so you can understand it. Have you ever seen a gas jet on a stove with individual holes and they have a tube where the gas comes in but before they get to the holes there&rsquo;s a little gadget with a light burning? If that&rsquo;s not there, what would happen to the gas? Collectively, the collective memory bank is the gas going through to the jets but the light, the pilot light, is the monitoring incidences when they should come due. So when you turn the switch on the burner, the gas will come up and you have to light it and you have to make sure that they all lit otherwise the room will fill with gas. But each one of those holes will act as an independent function yet they&rsquo;re all feeding off the one gas. Individual memory is like that, passing through us at the respiratory rate set up in the organism. The collective memory put us together as an organism. So now the light that is in us is the pilot light and that&rsquo;s what they refer to as the Christ in you or your intuitive nature, your self-internal directing nature. When you turn into it or Krishna consciousness is the same thing, when you turn to it you light up your individuality. You light the pilot light and then you turn the handle then all the other parts of the burner will get gas and they&rsquo;ll light up from that. So different parts of your individuality or individualistic memories will come up for you to reconcile but there is one grand pool where all of them fall back in but they come up to fit different incidences or requirements but you the person who is doing it may not realize that until you fall back into the (inaudible then general conversation).</p>
<h2 id="1983-july-30-part-1---flagstaff-good-solar">1983 July 30 Part 1 - Flagstaff Good Solar</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_30_1FlagstaffGoodSolarQ2NW3 - At that time he wasn&rsquo;t telling me much of timing because he himself wasn&rsquo;t interested in that but he knew that if the body didn&rsquo;t eliminate from what was put in, it would clog him up. I later discovered the time cycles in my own body and then tested it and worked with other people but then I realized that your body must stay on time to function and it&rsquo;s easy to get proper bowel movements from eating within the growth cycle of the food. Because you eat the fruits and nuts in the morning and prunes will clean you out from what you had last night or yesterday and then in the lunch time you eat certain foods there and drink the juice, the grape juice, and that will clean out again. At nighttime you drink the pineapple and that you cleans out so you&rsquo;re always going to have a release going through, nature placed it there for you to release. So as far as eating meat or not eating it, you must know your blood type and when you know your blood type then a little and there&rsquo;s only a certain time where that little is ideal. Usually you&rsquo;ll find people invite you to go out, if you&rsquo;re sticking close to solar way of eating within the light cycle, they never invite you to go eat out of cycle only around the lunar time. I came here just when full moon was almost tapering off, right? So I could indulge with a piece of fish or shrimp or something and this will taper off the chemistry in my body but over the years I&rsquo;ve observed that around the full moon time: three days before the full moon, the day of the full moon, and three days after the full moon within that period I would use a little of the animal product, the egg or the flesh or a little of the alcohol to stabilize the acid chemistry otherwise I get too alkaline. Now when that period is passed and the body is stabilized again, I&rsquo;ll go a full month without having to rely on it but it&rsquo;s not something I crave. There&rsquo;s a vast difference of craving that will pull your conscious energy down and your conscious awareness of internal qualities down is when you over indulge. If you take a little for the medicinal value, it doesn&rsquo;t have that is what we call homeopathic medicine. Homeopathy is a form of medicine which goes like this, it takes a thief to catch a thief and the other type of medicine where for every disease you must have a counter measure, that&rsquo;s a policeman to catch a thief. So orthodox medicine is like the policeman catching the thief. Unorthodox medicine is the thief to catch a thief. So your body is set up this way that a little is valid, too much no good, and not enough is no good either. So you must know your blood type and this has nothing to do with being religious or otherwise, this strictly has to do with your health functioning to make a livelihood and take care of your obligations in this world. Forget whatever religious affiliation you have, it has nothing to do with food. Food will make you more appreciative of what affiliations you have but get healthy first, if you&rsquo;re healthy all the things would be all right, every church will be an open door of God. It&rsquo;s like one man said to me he says &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t let me in church today because I was too dirty.&rdquo; So I says &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo; He says that night he had a dream and Jesus came knocking at the door and he said, &ldquo;What were you crying about that they didn&rsquo;t let you in the church this morning?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t let me since they built it.&rdquo; (Laughter). So again it is what we eat, it don&rsquo;t have nothing to do with religious attitudes but nevertheless we&rsquo;ll become more spiritual and religious minded, our values and morals will improve a lot when you start looking at the nutrition in its proper perspective. Audience: What if you uh go to visit your relatives in Minnesota and you&rsquo;re on the solar diet and then for a whole week they&rsquo;re giving you all these different foods and you don&rsquo;t know what to say? Adano: You have three choices, it&rsquo;s a yes, no, and a maybe now. You&rsquo;re asking the wrong man who has been through this already and the answer is yes, no, maybe. Yes, I may hurt their feelings by saying I don&rsquo;t touch the stuff because I&rsquo;m following a certain way of eating, that&rsquo;s the straight blunt truth of it. No, I will not hurt their feelings, I can excuse and create a statement like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m under medical observation and my doctors don&rsquo;t allow me to use this type of stuff for the time being. You don&rsquo;t mind if I don&rsquo;t touch it?&rdquo; Then they accept that, that&rsquo;s just a facade or a cosmetic conversation so they don&rsquo;t pressure you. And maybe by knowing the various juices of the day from the various fruits you can innovate a stabilization while visiting with them. So in the morning they may give you bacon and eggs to eat, okay eat the bacon and eggs but ask them for some kind of apple juice or apple cider vinegar and take two teaspoons of the apple cider vinegar and two teaspoons of the honey and eight ounces of distilled water and just drink it and that will stabilize instead of hurting their feelings. Everybody&rsquo;s got some vinegar in the house or you can go out and buy it yourself and keep it in your travel bag so that way you don&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable and you&rsquo;re not hurting their feelings because they&rsquo;re inviting you out the goodness of their heart. And maybe another thing is you can be tested kinesiologically and find that the food will knock out your energy in the morning but if you pray over it and then suddenly you put it in your hand and check it, you suddenly see that the energy is holding, we have done this many times. That&rsquo;s why you pray over the food, you change the kinesiological reaction for the time lapse while you use it and therefore it will not knock out your mechanism, it will not be a toxic reaction, and you can pass through the whole day without being effected by it so prayer over a meal has its value now. In the medical profession and they may say yes and also you may be hypnotizing yourself or you&rsquo;re setting up a placebo effect. Whatever it is you want to label it just for the sake of not hurting their feelings, use it and it&rsquo;s valid. As far as your health is concerned it will cope with it but if you don&rsquo;t do something to nullify its effect on you, the biological effect will take place in your own enzymes. The reason being is if you call me a son of a gun before I hear it, you would be toxified by saying it and I&rsquo;ll show you how that is possible. That&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;It is not what you put in your mouth that defiles you but what comes out of your mouth defiles you.&rdquo; You have to stink to call me a son of a gun and you have to use your own vocal cords to say it. By the same token you&rsquo;re going to swallow your saliva back and it&rsquo;s toxic with the intent of what you want to label me and therefore your tummy and hydrochloric is knocked out and we can measure that and see it and then take a test and see how high that toxin went up in that split second. I may not even hear, I may be deaf to you, it may peter in or slowly at some moment in time &ldquo;Well I feel kind of icky about this guy. I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo; But that will come after but the worst effect would be in you the person that&rsquo;s doing it. We did many tests like that you see to find out what we do to ourselves. So again what you say over the food can be a way of neutralizing it, most doctors are using those methods now but if you go and you know what to do then you&rsquo;re not threatened. 0:10 There&rsquo;s a story that goes like this, it occurred to Yogananda one time. He said that a woman and Yogananda and some friends were going to a meeting and when the meeting was over they stopped in a restaurant to eat. It was a Chinese restaurant and they asked for vegetable Chow Mein but it so happened there was a mix-up in the kitchen, I call it a comedy of errors. They brought the food and on the woman&rsquo;s plate who was ordering there was chicken. Well she got so upset to see the chicken that she was going to berate the waiter so Yogananda looked up and said &ldquo;Sister, it&rsquo;s bad enough that the chicken is dead but that karma is over but the worse karma you&rsquo;re making now is berating your brother who is God in the flesh. Maybe he&rsquo;s testing you so sit up and eat the chicken.&rdquo; (Laughter). That&rsquo;s worse karma, this karma with the chicken, his karma is done finished, he had to come and be cooked in a pot. So again the attitude and knowing what to do after, your body will phase it off so a little&hellip; and if you took a little wine for your stomach&rsquo;s sake because there is no way your friend is going to know what you eat. They&rsquo;ll try their best, they want to be sociable, then take a little wine and that will phase off the effect. So I find sometimes I get invited out and I don&rsquo;t want to touch the product and so when they say &ldquo;Would you like a little liquor?&rdquo; I say &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s evening time, I&rsquo;ll take a little tequila.&rdquo; That makes them happy, they don&rsquo;t feel threatened, and they invited you but that stabilizes the stomach and when you go back and your body is normalizing, you meditate again. The important thing is that you don&rsquo;t feel threatened and you know what to do. If you don&rsquo;t know what to do then that&rsquo;s a problem but if you know what to do with them&hellip; A Master is only a person who knows timing for every single thing in this world around him, he is a Master of time. He is the final touch to the machinery and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s called a Master, he knows exactly to make the final touches that makes the thing function right. So we are all Masters of ourselves as we become conscious of the thing so don&rsquo;t be threatened though. I&rsquo;ve seen where people get so uptight and I used to be like that too, wouldn&rsquo;t touch nothing, and it wasn&rsquo;t helping me because it knocked out my chemistry too. To be a 100% deviant or 100% non-deviant was not&hellip; it&rsquo;s knowing how to function in it. Now there&rsquo;s a difference between &ldquo;asked and offered&rdquo; or go craving it. When you say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do without this and I can&rsquo;t do without that&rdquo; then you really are off time but the funny thing is this, you will never find somebody who is addicted to anything using that thing in its right time. They&rsquo;re always using it in the wrong time and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re addicted to it and they can&rsquo;t stop craving it because they&rsquo;re consuming it or using it in its wrong time. The addiction level is always found in the wrong time, the allergic level is always found in the right time. By the same token, we use that method now to take care of a lot of people who drink, smoke, or on drugs, to stabilize their addictive time or their allergic time. When they get off it, they get well. So that is showing us more and more that the timing is more important over the type and then the quantity is next. Once you know the timing then the quantity and type comes next but if you don&rsquo;t know the timing, you&rsquo;re going to go off and then you gonna hurt yourself more. Everything is here to be used, too much no good and not at all no good, but timing is important. Any other question? Audience: About the pineapple juice, is canned pineapple juice alright? Adano: If you can get fresh good and fine. If you can&rsquo;t get fresh, use the canned but they do make canned pineapple juice now without any additives in it, it&rsquo;s just plain juice and I drink it with a little aloe vera juice because aloe vera juice is very important to your body especially at night. It stabilizes the major organs of your body at night which you do need to stabilize, your gallbladder, your liver, and the large intestine for the morning disposal. Also it&rsquo;s ideal for the rectal area of the body and the genital area of the body if there&rsquo;s any disturbance of in those areas, it will start clearing it up and it&rsquo;s good for the lungs too. So it&rsquo;s an unusual product yet it&rsquo;s a night plant, it&rsquo;s from the bromeliad family, you mix it with the pineapple juice at night and drink it. We use it a lot in our clinic for people who have a lot of intestinal problems and they don&rsquo;t know how to correct it so we make them drink the pineapple juice with it at night to correct their intestinal problems. But it&rsquo;s ideal at night and if you take it look for the one that&rsquo;s just plain, there&rsquo;s nothing added to it. Audience: What proportion of the pineapple juice and the aloe vera juice? Adano: Half and half. Audience: What are your feelings about the preventative measures that they take with infants as far as immunization. Adano: Vaccinations there is a yes and a no and a maybe. Again, it&rsquo;s when they give it to you and what you do after to help you not deprive the immune system or make it reliant on the product. I do not prevent the person from going to the vaccination because the school is not going to admit you in the public without it but at the same time I tell the person what to do for the baby or the child and then what to do after the vaccination is given. See you&rsquo;re only vaccinating it for certain types of illnesses and you can build up the immune level so that when the vaccination is given, it doesn&rsquo;t have any really high reactive action to the system because the immune level is high enough and it will cope with it. At the same time if you put in certain foods during that time, the vaccine would tend to be less reactive or toxic to the system, it will phase off and go out quicker. But that doesn&rsquo;t make the child less immune, it just reassures its immune system because when you don&rsquo;t know then you can feel threatened by it. Audience: What kind of measures can you take? Should you wait longer? Adano: No if you&rsquo;re going to take the child for a vaccination, make sure that there&rsquo;s no milk products in this stomach. Audience: Including mother&rsquo;s milk? Adano: Well mother&rsquo;s milk is alkaline, cow&rsquo;s milk is acid. The Eastern people don&rsquo;t drink cow&rsquo;s milk as we thought at one time, they drink yak milk, buffalo milk, and goat milk. All these milks are alkaline but we use the term &ldquo;they drink milk, why can&rsquo;t we drink milk? Or how come they don&rsquo;t have the problems we have?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s because the milk is not cow milk. A Hindu will drink more milk than any person I know of but the moment he drinks cow milk, he gets sick, but put him back in his environment and let him drink his buffalo milk or his yak milk and his goat milk, he doesn&rsquo;t have the lung problems or the mucous buildup because that milk is alkaline like a human milk. See human milk is alkaline, in fact the donkey, the antelope, then the goat in that order of alkalinity. The antelope or the donkey is more like human, the goat is like human but it does have a residual action, and then the cow is next. For large quantity for production but the reaction acidity is high but as far as human milk is concerned or goat milk is concerned, it&rsquo;s alkaline. The yak milk, buffalo milk, they&rsquo;re all alkaline so they don&rsquo;t have the problem. 0:20 That&rsquo;s one thing you don&rsquo;t put in before the vaccine, don&rsquo;t put milk into the child&rsquo;s mechanism. Then after the vaccine is administered, you can wash the vaccine area with a little aloe vera or apple cider vinegar so it doesn&rsquo;t have the reaction on the mechanism as severely as it would in another person, this would satisfy the mechanism of the body. The aloe vera will stabilize it, the apple cider vinegar will stabilize it. I know a lot of people who have gone through that, they&rsquo;re okay now and they don&rsquo;t have the problem. They had to go through it for the sake of the school but if you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s different. When you know what to do, that&rsquo;s in your favor. You see sometimes if the person is not immunized and then there is a condition in the school and again if the child is not eating properly, he may be more susceptible. That&rsquo;s what you have to consider too you see? It&rsquo;s a whole lot better to have the immunization and understand what to do and then watching the nutritional balancing, then you wouldn&rsquo;t have the problem. But to not immunize the child and then if the child is eating a lot of french fries and Cokes some ice cream and different things and it gets sick then it&rsquo;s not a practical condition either. But if it&rsquo;s taken care of by not letting it have any milk products when it&rsquo;s going to be immunized and then cleansing the area, then it&rsquo;s no problem because when the condition comes up it&rsquo;s not going to be effected but that will not drop down it&rsquo;s immunity, it&rsquo;ll keep its immunity up. Audience: Is there a book or some literature with these ideas that you can pass on to others? Adano: Those who are being initiated will have a copy of it, it&rsquo;s going to be given to the initiates here. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done for a long time but it&rsquo;s agreed that at the initiation, for initiates, you&rsquo;ll have the copy of it. Right now we&rsquo;re working on a more technical book with all the research in it so far what they have available will be given to the initiates because the initiates needs it for his own life to stay healthy. The general public have access to all types of nutritional intake, we&rsquo;re not here to compete with them. The reason why we don&rsquo;t put it on the shelves is because unless you are ready for Solar Nutrition it wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense to you. It&rsquo;s a way of life that is naturally there but you have to try all the other methods and like tonight we&rsquo;re having supper and the young kids are talking about what they would love to eat and their parent would like them to eat Solar but I says &ldquo;No don&rsquo;t force the kid to be Solar because that&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo; It takes 30 years to muck it up and 30 years to clean it up and the body is designed to handle every type of concoction for 30 years. See disobedience is necessary for evolution and if you&rsquo;re gonna try to restrict the person to stay healthy from the start, he wouldn&rsquo;t know what it is to be sick and one of the rules of Solar Nutrition is &ldquo;you must eat to get sick in order to eat not to get sick.&rdquo; Nobody likes that but that&rsquo;s the way nature&rsquo;s got it and if you look at a child, the first thing it does when it&rsquo;s born and you leave it in the corner, it will reach out for something like this. It is always putting something in its mouth because that&rsquo;s the way they learn. Now you can try to insulate them against that but again they will deviate, they have to learn through some illness in the body and then turn to mom and dad for direction. Then mom and dad may give them some way to get well but eventually it will ingrain in their consciousness that the things they are doing are not so healthy then they quit it. At that time they have got the exposure to some of the aches and pains of the body then it would be more for them to see. So the concept that we&rsquo;re talking about is not something that will take over society, it is when you are ready it will be there for you but the parents who are on the path and understand what they&rsquo;re doing to maintain their own inner growth, they&rsquo;ll have it to work with. Audience: You might talk about the fact that we might have a workshop. Adano: Yes. Sometime when I come back through this area again we would like to set up a workshop for the group. You see in Houston we usually have it there once a month on the last Sunday of the month and it goes from 11 o&rsquo;clock to 6 o&rsquo;clock and we serve a lunch and a supper. We work out all the factors of Solar Nutrition. Audience: Is there a better time during the day to eat Brewer&rsquo;s Yeast? Adano: Brewer&rsquo;s Yeast is ideal from midday to 6:30 because the way it&rsquo;s grown it&rsquo;s in a light and it&rsquo;s ideal for that time. Night time it itches you. Morning time it makes you get upset gas. I used to take it all around the clock and found that in the morning I got gas, at night time it creates some more itching, and in the middle of the day it was valid. So in the middle of the day I sprinkle it on my food. Now the word Brewer&rsquo;s Yeast, again where what time of day would you drink beer? In the middle of the day because it&rsquo;s made from grain and the brewer&rsquo;s yeast is used to activate it so there again it&rsquo;s ideal. And the hops, see that&rsquo;s the time of day to use them so a glass of beer in the middle of the day is ideal for the body. See nature has placed everything within their own light cycle to be used, not to be abused. Audience: When you&rsquo;re talking about your tequila and your wine at the proper times of day, is that an addition to the food or is it something that serves the same purpose like you drink tequila instead of the pineapple juice? Adano: No, no. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re invited out to go out to supper at your friend&rsquo;s and they all want to go out and eat. Somebody says &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go eat barbecue,&rdquo; somebody says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat seafood or Chinese&rdquo; but you can select what you want to eat. Now if you want to eat plain vegetable Chinese food at a Chinese restaurant, they&rsquo;ll serve it to you because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re ordering. All right but let&rsquo;s saying now you&rsquo;re at a home where they cook the food and they have the meat already there placed, for your benefit to offset any effect, have a little tequila to release it. 0:30 Now if you&rsquo;re going out to a nightclub restaurant then you can order tequila by itself, not a margarita. A margarita has salt and lime, that concoction is not what we&rsquo;re talking about, order one shot of the tequila and you can order pineapple juice with it. They have it and then you mix the two and drink it at the end of the meal as an after dinner drink. TThis settles the stomach, it cleans out whatever you put in there that may be toxic and therefore you wouldn&rsquo;t have the problem. You don&rsquo;t need two or three of it, you just need one to settle the stomach. It&rsquo;s a cleanser, vitamin C is the anti-toxin vitamin, nature has to provide vitamin C in every period of the day because we are going to eat incorrectly and get toxic. So vitamin C is found in the citrus fruits in the morning but if you heat vitamin C, it&rsquo;s destroyed. All right, how is it possible for us to have vitamin C to take care of an intestinal problem because vitamin C in an orange is good for the lungs and the nasal tract but you can&rsquo;t heat it. Now we need vitamin C for intestinal catarrh, from an orange it wouldn&rsquo;t do a single good for it, it wouldn&rsquo;t help it. Nature must provide another source of vitamin C that can withstand heat so in the tomato she has placed vitamin C and you can cook the hell out of a tomato and never destroy the vitamin C reaction. Now there is where nature has now made the fantastic quantum leap, we were talking the other day about subatomic particles, she has made this quantum phenomenon of allowing vitamin C to withstand heat in the tomato but not in an orange. Because the orange is for the lungs and the nasal tract, the tomato is for the intestinal tract. All right, now let&rsquo;s say you have a catarrh in the rectal area or in genital area, she places vitamin C in alcohol. Now you can&rsquo;t place vitamin c in alcohol either the tomato or from the orange juice, it will dissipate yet here the Maguey plant that makes tequila while it&rsquo;s fermenting contains vitamin C and no matter how it&rsquo;s fermented to the highest form of alcohol, the vitamin C is found to be stable in it. Here we have vitamin C contained in an alcohol base by nature&rsquo;s own mechanics for a specific reason like you have hemorrhoids or polyps, that&rsquo;s where you need the vitamin C or you have a rash in the rectal area, you need the vitamin C, nature has placed it in there. So since C is an anti-toxin vitamin in the whole range, now from the source of food you&rsquo;re getting it. Now from a Coal Tar source, which is a synthetic vitamin C, we find that the Coal Tar source doesn&rsquo;t work good in the morning and it doesn&rsquo;t work good at night, it only works good in the middle of the day because a Coal Tar is basically a midday substance and that vitamin C will work good for problems. So one time I took vitamin C and I crushed it up, put it in liquid, and left it the hydrochloric acid, and for 24 hours it never dissolved proving that no matter how we take these vitamins in solid form, they just sit in the stomach. I&rsquo;ve had in my own body where I saw that vitamins were expelled by colon irrigation and I have had patients who have taken vitamins for a long time are passing it out in chunks, it wasn&rsquo;t being absorbed. If it comes in the form of the food, it&rsquo;s absorbed. Sometimes too you may be toxic and the very food that you&rsquo;re eating, you&rsquo;re not absorbing it in the very food that it is supposed to be in due to the toxicity in the body. So cleaning out the toxins, then the absorption begins again. Audience: Since you have orange juice and grape juice and pineapple juice, you don&rsquo;t have to supplement yourself. Adano: No you don&rsquo;t have to. Audience: That&rsquo;s only if you&rsquo;ve eaten the meat? Adano: Exactly. Audience: There&rsquo;s always the possibility of amoebic dysentery. Adano: Amoebic dysentery, we use that for amoebic dysentery. Every time my nurse goes to Mexico and she has a lot of patients who go down there and get amoebic dysentery and she&rsquo;s always calling me on the phone &ldquo;What do I do with them?&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re living in the country where you have the most unique medicine cure for it but they don&rsquo;t do it. Anytime you leave this country and travel to another country, always drink a little of the local alcohol before you touch any of their food or water, put that in first, it&rsquo;s a natural immunizing principle for the body.&rdquo; When she did it for herself or her boyfriend and other people, they were convinced. Not too long ago one was going to Colombia and she said to me &ldquo;What do I do when I get there?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;On the plane take a little of the local alcohol that is produced in Colombia. Don&rsquo;t touch the food or anything else, take a little of the alcohol so it immunizes the area in the colon then you can use the food.&rdquo; Before she used to have the problem, when she got there she&rsquo;d get sick. This trip she did exactly what I told her, she got down there and she got a little of the local alcohol that they would grow from the Maguey plant to make tequila, she drank that first then she ate regular eating with her friends away from the hotels when most people knew her that she would not go out to eat like that. This trip she went out and ate and came back and when she came back on the plane she remembered that she&rsquo;s coming back to the States, she got a little Jim Beam, had a little nip of that and she was all right in the States again with the local water. She came to visit me in the clinic, she brought me a wonderful present, a the gift of the heart, and was commenting on how the principle works. Whenever you change your areas, the water and the plants are very all different to your body system and the immunizing of the colon is a little of the alcohol or local wine. The Japanese play it safe too by drinking Sake because it&rsquo;s rice, it&rsquo;s a grass you see and you can use that morning, noon, and night without any problem because it&rsquo;s the only neutral food like that. See they don&rsquo;t classify rice as a grain botanically, it&rsquo;s a grass, it&rsquo;s always been classified as a grass and its effect is in essence ideal for the colon. Any part of the world you go, you&rsquo;ll find grass and so the Sake has been proven to be an ideal immunizer in traveling. Audience: When you say a little, what do you mean? Adano: One jigger, a little is a jigger. You know what an actual jigger is? An ounce is a jigger, you don&rsquo;t need more than that. It stabilizes the colon, it stabilizes the body. It is not something to be addicted to because it&rsquo;s not that. Your body produces the chemical anyhow as an antifreeze but you&rsquo;re going to be exposed to all type of food and travel and therefore the adjustment takes too long. So to compensate for that one jigger of the local alcohol within the light cycle and your body will stabilize. Audience: What about honey? Adano: Honey is neutral but you have many sources of which honey and there are times of the day that honey would not be ideal. It&rsquo;s a neutral food but let&rsquo;s say for instance you are suffering from a hormone imbalance and if you were to take the honey with the cocoa bean, you will not help the hormone imbalance, you throw it off more. You have to take the cocoa bean that you make cocoa with the Hershey&rsquo;s cocoa and the bean grows on a tree. They take the cocoa bean and they&rsquo;ve powdered it, they grind it into a powder, nothing is added to it so you can buy it in the grocery store, it&rsquo;s called pure 100% cocoa powder or baking cocoa and you use maple syrup that comes from the maple tree now. Not honey because honey will act inversely to the hormone and the cocoa has an ingredient that is known to be a hormone stabilizer for male and female. That&rsquo;s why you find people crave chocolate and don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re really craving it, it&rsquo;s because as you get older the hormones are going off their cycles, they&rsquo;re depleting either the male or the female ones, they are breaking down too quick. So you take that with maple syrup and the maple syrup comes from cutting the bark of the tree, the maple tree, and let the syrup leech off. You combine that with water and you drink one cup in the morning and that&rsquo;s a stabilizer but if you were to use honey with it, it would distort. Now you want to use honey on top of your fruits in the morning, that&rsquo;s okay. Now if you want to use honey in the middle of the day with your pastries, everybody loves to have a piece of cake or pie or something but then that&rsquo;s the time of the day to use it and it&rsquo;s ideal. Now if you use it at night, you can use it again with some kind of a pastry yet each period of day the flour that is used can be taken from that growth cycle. Grain in the middle of the day, all your seven grains can be used for a pastry as a shell. Rice being a neutral grass and it makes one of the most ideal pastries. You take the nuts and grind it up with the rice flour and you make your pastry for the morning. You can take your potato and mix it with your rice flour and use it for evening time. Now at my clinic there&rsquo;s a young lady who does all my baking and John has met her, she bakes this way for us using rice and incorporating (inaudible) for the crust. When I first met her she was brought and dumped literally dumped inside the door of the clinic and left there to die. She was working for the government at the time and they couldn&rsquo;t find anything wrong with her and they couldn&rsquo;t keep her because they had no way to validate and they couldn&rsquo;t sign her off for the problem that she was having. She got sick on the job and she was under government regulations and they took her into the hospital, the doctors did all the tests and they couldn&rsquo;t find a single thing to validate for the illness. First they checked and in the first four hours she showed a high deficiency of minerals in the bloodstream. They didn&rsquo;t give her anything, she was under observation, and the next four hours the blood showed a tremendous abundance of those minerals then the next four hours a tremendous deficiency. Well this went on for about maybe six days and by that time the whole panel of doctors they said they can&rsquo;t find what could be doing this to her body and there&rsquo;s no way they could keep her. So they finally called one of her friends and told her to take her home, to let her go home and die because they don&rsquo;t have any way to stop it, they couldn&rsquo;t sign her off to get compensation because they can&rsquo;t label the illness. Well this friend called me and he&rsquo;s an initiate he says &ldquo;Adano, what do I do?&rdquo; I say &ldquo;Well love can work if you want to bring her over&rdquo; and he brought her. I had a pyramid and I put her under the pyramid and when she barely opened her eyes I said to her &ldquo;Ginny, I&rsquo;m not God and I can&rsquo;t help you but I&rsquo;ll tell you what, you can do one of two things: losers aren&rsquo;t born, winners are born. You can decide for yourself if you want to stay on the other side of the world or get up and move.&rdquo; She says &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re born a winner. The sperm that got to the ovum is you right there.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; The moment I hear she&rsquo;s (inaudible) connectiveness, I know she&rsquo;s gonna pull out and so I leave her there for awhile and after that I hear (inaudible) sounds and then we start working on her but she was triggering her innate qualities to (inaudible). Then finally we put her nutrition, first she had to clean up the colon, and then organize her diet (inaudible). Now she got well but she can&rsquo;t work for nobody because nobody will hire her and she can&rsquo;t collect compensation because they can&rsquo;t fire her off. So I said to her &ldquo;You can bake for me. We need the food in the clinic and this is the way you can earn a livelihood but my baking is different, it&rsquo;s based to Solar Nutritional eating. I love to eat and I don&rsquo;t want to go and buy apple pie made out of whole wheat flour and apples at the same time. So I only eat an apple pie when it&rsquo;s mixed with rice flour.&rdquo; She says &ldquo;Rice flour?&rdquo; And Christina has learned a lot of cooking techniques so they&rsquo;re learning from their own illnesses and if it was just a fad, you need a nurse like Christina to convince you because when she went back to Mexico and worked among the people there and the problems that she ran into and the way they were eating&hellip; She told me not long ago &ldquo;If anything works, Solar Nutrition works in the worst areas of the world.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;It works because it has nothing to do with your belief system, it just has to do with the way nature grows things&rdquo; and she sees it over and over, especially as she worked among the natives of Mexico. They come in from all parts of Mexico asking her, they call her Sister Christine, &ldquo;do something for us&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;Oh my God, what can I do?&rdquo; She calls me and says, &ldquo;Adano, what do I do in a case like this?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve see how I work, apply it, just apply it.&rdquo; The fruit, the nut, and she gets the results and she sees it over and over. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re testing it more and more, the people who find it very difficult to change. Audience: As it is difficult to know when to eat what, could we try to determine with a pendulum what is good for us and when and what is not good. Adano: That has to do with the toxicity situation, you can determine that by the pendulum but again once it&rsquo;s in the growth cycle, your body will correct itself. It may at first be adverse to the body because of the toxicity and it may act like a reaction but the body&rsquo;s own enzymes are thrown off because they&rsquo;ve eaten incorrectly, they will start correcting themselves again very fast. 0:50 The reason behind that is you wouldn&rsquo;t work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, you&rsquo;ll have to have a rest period. The enzymes are like that, there are many enzymes in your mouth but all don&rsquo;t break down, let&rsquo;s say protein, even though they are designed to break down protein since protein comes from different sources. Now protein from a nut is different from the protein from the meat in its geometry and the protein from the meat is different from the protein in the egg yet the enzymes know by the computing action which one is triggered off to break down nut protein, which one&rsquo;s triggered off to break down animal protein, and which is triggered off to break down egg protein but we didn&rsquo;t know this before, we just assumed that they will break down protein, that was our assumption. It is until the nitty-gritty gets into it and then they start to find that these enzymes are very specific in their behavior and so they will break down the nut protein very easily and they move in mass to breakdown nut protein in the morning. Those that break down meat protein or egg protein, they are doing what? Sleeping, they are resting, they are in a circadian movement of a principle inside, they have a rest period because that&rsquo;s not their assigned time. Now if you put in the meat in the morning, the enzymes that break down nut protein is not going to go handle the meat protein because it isn&rsquo;t organized to work with that and the one that is organized to work with it is sleeping. So that protein remains longer in the system and it starts to ferment but we didn&rsquo;t know that years ago, we&rsquo;re discovering it now that there seems to be something causing this delayed action and increase in carbon dioxide. It is because the enzymes that normally would break down nut protein can&rsquo;t apply themselves to break down the meat protein so what they do is simply this, they encapsulate it and put it in a sort of a storage bank waiting for the other enzymes to come into action in the daytime cycle. So as soon as the light cycle of where you are in the location triggers over to say 11:30 or 12 o&rsquo;clock, those enzymes start waking up but then they have to break through the encapsulation that has been placed upon that protein from the other enzymes and they have to break that down so they work harder to break it down and then they work their way through it and dispose of it. Now if you put egg in, the one that breaks down nut isn&rsquo;t going to do more than encapsulate it and when the other one wakes up for the middle of the day, he&rsquo;s going to see this encapsulation but he isn&rsquo;t going to do anything more than encapsulate it again because it&rsquo;s not the type that he can handle. Then evening time comes around now, that enzyme wakes up and he has a double encapsulation over the substance to break down. So you find why the pain and the intense gas action queasiness goes on in the body, it&rsquo;s that delayed content in the body. Now a pendulum can tell you &ldquo;yes this is good and this is not good for you&rdquo; and what time but again you&rsquo;ll find when it tells you that it&rsquo;s good for you, it&rsquo;ll still fall within the growth cycle nine times out of ten. That&rsquo;s how we used to test it and Ginny was my very good example but in Ginny&rsquo;s case she was totally knocked out and her whole electromagnetic field was reversed and that blows away a lot of people who don&rsquo;t understand the reversal of the electrical fields. It&rsquo;s going downward instead of going upwards and this electrical field is on this side and this electrical field is on this side and this one is on the front, they were all reversed in her because she was totally thrown off. So the first thing to do with her was to get her to trigger in her brain that she was a winner, the moment you get her to think that way, all these signals have got to start pulling back to move. That&rsquo;s why they say when a person has a cancer and if they get pregnant, the cancer goes away because the trophoblast cell that becomes cancerous is forced to perform its true function of making a human body and not make a malformed organism. So therefore it quits performing malformation and starts organizing to work. So she being thrown off in her balance, we had to trigger her to the realization that she was a winner. This triggered the body back now and then the polarity started to come back but then we had to find the food. Invariably what she was eating, and she was really eating out of cycle so desperately, is what we found out but then we start tracking. But you can use the pendulum for what should go in, the quantity, but again it will fall under the light cycle of its growth and that would be more obvious because you never put in something out of its light cycle, it will not absorb, no matter what quantity it is, it doesn&rsquo;t absorb. It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re working with allergic patterns and addictive patterns and you should never eat one food more than once a day on a real rhythm unless you&rsquo;re cleaning up the body, you should only eat one food of each cycle once a day. Audience: In the case of the cancer stopped by pregnancy, is there a chance that it will start again after the pregnancy? Adano: Nine times out of ten no, one time out of ten it does. There again it has to do with the trauma, whatever the trauma was that triggered it in the first place, the trauma may still be dormant and may come up again. Unless the trauma is resolved, it will come back up but nine times out of ten it doesn&rsquo;t, the body resolves it. It depends on where cancer is too, if it&rsquo;s in an area where it&rsquo;s supposed to be for reproduction, it never comes back but if it&rsquo;s in an area not for reproduction, it may come back. Audience: Are most cancers due to trauma? Adano: Well any disease of the body falls on the four category categories: trauma, bacteria, breakage, malnutrition, heredity but heredity is incorporated in the first four. So trauma is the most important one and then the bacteria will start forming and then maybe later a breakage or injury and then we will track it down to nutrition that is contributing to it. It&rsquo;s easy to correct the nutrition, correct the breakage, and the bacterial condition, it&rsquo;s very difficult to correct the trauma if you don&rsquo;t know where the trauma is. So that&rsquo;s the one that always eludes us and that&rsquo;s the one that has to be corrected before the body is functioning properly and the trauma usually occurs before the injury to the body. Whenever a symptom appears in the body, rest assured the trauma occurred before it. Now there are ways to track it down and then we can evaluate it and start cleaning it up but here&rsquo;s a funny phenomenon. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been to work and you had an argument with the boss and the boss happens to be a man, invariably the left side of your body is going to break down and invariably you&rsquo;re going to start craving milk products more than usual. If it&rsquo;s a woman that you have the argument with or the trauma, the right side starts to break down, that is very peculiar. 1:00 It&rsquo;s telling you in its own way how the body is set up since we are part ovum, part sperm or part mother, part father, there are electromagnetic fields connected to the mother and the father and the parts of the anatomy that will be (inaudible), front or back. These are the things that we work with all the time and that&rsquo;s in the trauma level. Audience: Would it follow that a child born with a physical defect in those parts of their body would have had trauma or their parents would have had a trauma before it was born? Adano: Yes, they do. Remember nature and all the religious concepts that come down are very scientific if you look at it objectively apart from a religious heritage into a scientific understanding. The scriptural writing would say &ldquo;I visit the sins of the parents onto the third and fourth generation.&rdquo; I, who? I, the Creative Life, visit means reoccur or come into manifestation, the sins, the deviations of the shocks. The word sin simply means missing the mark, it came from an old archer term thousands of years ago and we got hung up in the dramatics of it and the guild complexes of it when actuality it&rsquo;s just a term meaning missing the mark and not focusing correctly. So this particular non-correct focusing would automatically set up reactions. Well if you take that into consideration, you can&rsquo;t have something without a reaction and to put it in the language of physics, Newton&rsquo;s first law is every action has an equal reaction, right? Good, take it in a religious context is &ldquo;what you sow, you reap,&rdquo; that would be valid. The same thing &ldquo;for every action, there&rsquo;s an equal reaction.&rdquo; When you take it now into the Oriental concept of causation and effect, they call it karma, the law of cause and effect, there is no effect without a cause. They&rsquo;re all saying the same thing but from different avenues of looking at the truth. In the pregnancy whatever our grandparents or parents have done and is carried over we call it heredity. Whatever occurs during the time of the pregnancy, if there&rsquo;s a tremendous argument or shock that will be carried into the pregnant child during that state. All right, by the same token there has been research done and many experiments done of educating the child while in the womb like in the case of Vyas who wrote the Bhagavad Gita dictated the whole thing to the wife while she was pregnant and sound asleep and when his son was born, age four he came right up to the daddy and recited the whole Bhagavad Gita. Now this is the positive look at the same principle, something constructive versus something destructive in terms of a traumatic condition. We can say that was a super trauma to her or having her son confronted dad and repeat the Bhagavad Gita. It could be the opposite, it could have been an argument and then the child comes up with some deviance in the mechanism, constriction in the throat or arm or something. So you&rsquo;re looking at plus/minus situations prior to birth in a pregnancy level, there is where the traumas have their origin most of the time. By the same token, there is a connectedness of the cause/effect that since this is not a &ldquo;something for nothing&rdquo; universe and it&rsquo;s not the first and last time you&rsquo;re here and we haven&rsquo;t resolved all our obligations or frustrations, we are gonna have to complete them life after life. For example, I may be having an argument with 50 people and at 50 different times in my life and when I realized the mistake is really mine and I tried to correct it and I only correct 38 by managing to meet 38 of them and make up for the mistake. The other 12 have already passed on, I&rsquo;ll never get to see them to make up the mistake but I&rsquo;ll carry the anguish. So that&rsquo;s the connectedness now which we call reincarnation connectedness to have to again come into our body form with the unfinished pattern to try to work it out. So parents who provide that particular mold with those particular consequences or problems that are similar to the ones that I haven&rsquo;t resolved, I&rsquo;m going to end up in that mold to work it out because that&rsquo;s where the the bill has to be paid. Now today we have similar things like this, you don&rsquo;t have to go to the telephone company to pay the telephone bill, there are a lot of supermarkets that will take your money for the telephone company. So it&rsquo;s the same thing, you don&rsquo;t have to go looking directly for that one person to resolve it, you&rsquo;re thrown into a body form with certain circumstances or parents who have similar conditions that provide you now to come and work it out and there is where the trauma shunts off itself before the birth. Thank you. Audience: We have a glass of pineapple juice. Adano: Oh gosh, thank you. Herb tea is very good in the middle of the day. In terms of medicinal accuracy, then that&rsquo;s different, the herbs are of different height. When we&rsquo;re using them for medicinal accuracy and for the problems of the body, we try to stay within their height from the ground up to relation to the light and we have tracked down also the chemistry is valid. Each light cycle, the same chemical can be found but in different light cycles and growth cycles, height cycles, and different parts of the anatomy to which it reacts best. The reason why we&rsquo;re finding this now is that chrono-biology is the emerging science of a lot of unusual phenomena dealing with time of biological reactions especially when dealing with cancer. Cancer is a disease without a cause mentioned in your bible, it&rsquo;s called the disease without cause but here is one of the main problems we don&rsquo;t look at in our way of eating that is contributed to the cancer. If a farmer has a cow and it has a calf and the calf is nursing from the cow or mother and let&rsquo;s say the udder is bruised by the lip of the calf allowing blood to seep through with the milk, what would the farmer do? Audience: He would take the calf and nurse it on milk. Adano: Right, he will stop the nursing of the calf from the mother. Okay in biblical times if you&rsquo;re a very orthodox Jew and it comes down to be known as the Kosher law of preparing food, you don&rsquo;t mix a milk product with a meat product. 1:10 Now every Rabbi knows that and every kosher place knows that, every farmer knows you don&rsquo;t allow the milk to mix with the blood but we who look at that need something more specific otherwise we&rsquo;re going to end up becoming dogmatic in it. Before I go into the specific, I&rsquo;ll show you what we&rsquo;re doing in our own society. We will take that cow, milk it, and out of the milk we&rsquo;ll make cheese and then we will clobber the cow, make hamburger. We&rsquo;ll gather the grain out of the barn and make bread and we put the hamburger on top the bread and put the cheese on top of the hamburger and melt it and then we call it cheeseburger. It&rsquo;s a very nice meal and after all it&rsquo;s healthy as far as a starving person is concerned (laughter) but in the chemical relationship as far as a kosher person preferring kosher eating, he wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, that&rsquo;s meat and that&rsquo;s dairy product. As far as a farmer who sees that, it&rsquo;s okay for his child to eat it but not his calf but we who are looking at it objectively now see the reason behind it. The lactic acid from the milk does not bond with the hemoglobin of the blood, they are antagonistic forces thus causing a tremendous drop in nitrogen in the mechanism that is necessary to keep the trophoblast cells sleeping because you have them from head to foot. They&rsquo;re one of the cells in the formation of the body that shuts off and goes to sleep when the baby is born but they will wake up if the nitrogen content drops below a certain level that keeps them sleeping. If the nitrogen level is kept at a safe level value that the body is organized for them to stay at and sleep, they will not wake up but this now starts to make them drop down. Plus if you eat protein minus nitrogen, it also forces them to wake up and when they wake up because the nitrogen content has gone down that will keep them sleeping, they feed on protein. Every living creature feeds on protein to grow but they don&rsquo;t feed on protein with nitrogen, they feed on protein minus nitrogen. All waste products of the human body is protein minus nitrogen, that&rsquo;s how they spread so fast and that&rsquo;s why it becomes so difficult to control it. Now Dr. Horevski who uses in his research not too long in the last four years, the combination of platinum and chlorine made a solution known as platinum chloride that can actually inhibit the function of the trophoblast cell that becomes cancerous and put it back to sleep or suspended it down to a non-malignant behavior, has found there are only two times in of the day that this injection of his works and doesn&rsquo;t work. If he administers the injection before 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the patient recovers and goes home and they don&rsquo;t have the cancer condition in the body but if the patient is administered the injection after midday, they die the next day with pneumonia of the lungs. All the death records of those that have died show that and the time it was administered versus those that were alive and went home. Then he began to experiment because he wondered why some were living and some were dying, he began to take rats now and test it and the conclusiveness is that the time was vital in the administration. So anytime a nurse is given the instruction for a certain type of cancer in the body requiring platinum chloride to be used, she has to inject it before midday. Usually at spleen time that is between nine and eleven. Thank you.</p>

<p>Adano83_07_30_2FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3 - &hellip;Saints and Sages of all religions, Angelic hosts, beloved Jesus be Thou present and bless this meditation and open the hearts of these loved ones. Free their lives from all obstacles and bless them for the physical, mental, and spiritual unfoldment. And may Thou love shine on the sanctuary of their hearts. Lead them from the darkness to the light, the ignorance to the truth, bondage to the freedom, the impractical to the practical, the unconscious for the conscious. Release from them peace that passes all understanding. Om Shanti Peace. Repeat &ldquo;Om.&rdquo; (Group chants &ldquo;Om&rdquo; several times then group chanting Om three times to each part of the spine: coccyx, sacral, lumbar, dorsal, cervical, medulla and then back down to coccyx. Then chanting Om seven times). Those who have the technique of the Kriya can do their Kriya technique. Those who are not initiated can place the left thumb on the right wrist and feel for the pulse beat. The breath and the pulse are one and the same, it&rsquo;s synchronous life. As you identify with it, it will lead you back to the source. Those who have the technique can go directly to it. (Gap in tape). Thank you. 0:10 Satsang is the ancient way of coming together in spirit, it&rsquo;s always known as fellowship with truth and in Western thinking reference is often made to it as &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; To the initiate, the sense of feeling or recognizing the connectedness with the creative self, which is the name that merges with you and radiates out of the Christ principle, can be felt in a satsang. Sometimes you can feel the presence walk the room or you can feel the heightening of your senses but above all the peace that gives you strength to go on day-to-day moment-to-moment becomes self-evident. Some of us may see the form of some exalted Saint or Holy One, others may feel or hear the internal music but that is not the full measure of the spiritual intent. The full measure of the special intent is to be able to open your eyes and function here consciously with that internal strength increasing in you. Also, the evidence of an increasing immunity to the breakdown of the body. The body is a temple and tapping its potential and applying it in the waking state is your evidence for you that you have contact with the Divine. If someone was to photograph this room with all of us sitting in here and then take the picture and cut it up into 100 little square pieces and give it to someone and say &ldquo;here is a jigsaw puzzle, see if you can recognize someone you know in the jigsaw puzzle.&rdquo; Then as you struggle to put the pieces together and finally you pinpoint someone in the picture and you say, &ldquo;Ah, I know this person.&rdquo; That recognition after all that putting together is exactly what we have done when we come out of the meditation. Before you came out, sitting in the room and going inward is like putting the pieces together and when all is put together, recognizing someone in the picture is like opening your eyes and validating that you have something tangible to relate to. If you don&rsquo;t recognize anyone in the picture then you&rsquo;re still back inside the other realm. The emphasis is always after you&rsquo;ve come out of the meditation. Here is where meditation becomes the meditation of the meditation. When you were sitting down for the last 30 or 40 minutes, you were cleaning up the house for the guest and God is the guest. In the living body the unexpected occurs, the unanticipated occurs in the waking state. How the incidences occur during the day and how they fall in place to make a meaningful relationship, this is the conscious meditation because it&rsquo;s in the conscious meditation that you&rsquo;re living the peace that passes all understanding. We can sit down and close our eyes and spend long hours inside and still fool ourselves that we have found the peace that passes all understanding. Yet when we come out the eyes open and go through the behavioral movements of the day in the environment and see how these incidences all fall into place in their timing, by the time the day is over you have lived the conscious meditation. The conscious meditation is your moment to moment living, it is your encounter with the Christ principal inside of you that you have tapped and now recognizing it working outside of you. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said to his disciples &ldquo;Come I&rsquo;ll make you fishers of men.&rdquo; He was giving them the encounter of the working meditation, the living meditation, by going out and functioning with men. One Master would say &ldquo;like a fisherman you catch fish&rdquo; and the Master is turning to disciples to go catch Souls and make you a fisher of Souls yet it could lead you to believe you&rsquo;re out to go convert people and get carried away with the wrong understanding. 0:20 The conscious meditation has no intention of converting anyone. The conscious meditation is the art of interacting with everyone, learning to realize that everyone is friend and everyone is God, everyone is a part of the jigsaw puzzle. More important is where you fit in the jigsaw puzzle. See some of us may feel out of place but until you recognize where you fit into the jigsaw puzzle, you&rsquo;re not out of place and it&rsquo;s on the conscious level, the waking state moment to moment that you have the encounter of knowing in daily events. You become a center in your day and the events revolve around you like a spider web drawing in towards you and falling into place. So when you come out of meditation and you look around, feel this centeredness. You&rsquo;re in this realm, you&rsquo;re in the Now, you are the Being. This Being has no name until someone calls this Being by some label that they are familiar to call it and then this Being will compute and respond to that label but during that time try to be the Being, try to feel your unity with everything in the waking state. Yukteswar would say &ldquo;the measurement of your spirituality is determined by the length of time that this peace stays with you in the waking state.&rdquo; For years I struggled to let it work through: 10, 15, and hour, two hours only to realize the information was too generalized, it wasn&rsquo;t specific enough to where it could be 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Now to help you to appreciate what you have and what you are in a more specific way, when you come out try and feel you are like the spider or the center of the target and the whole thing is revolving around you. And don&rsquo;t associate with your name until the environment interacts or press the program button to your computing mechanism for you to associate with it because then it draws out from you. But if you stay in the center and just be the Beingness and feel that the Beingness has become you, gradually you&rsquo;re not drained away, it begins to stay longer and longer and intensifies itself. That&rsquo;s why Yogananda would say &ldquo;self chosen seclusion is the price of peace&rdquo; because you&rsquo;re at the center of everything and there is no one while you&rsquo;re in seclusion is going to call you by your name to drain you off from your Being. So periodical seclusion is an asset to enhance this quality. Even in the Christian faith you take a sabbatical or something, you&rsquo;re looking for a self-chosen seclusion. You can do this at home, you don&rsquo;t want to aggravate anyone in the family who is not familiar with this type of life, and so when they&rsquo;re all sound asleep or gone to work, you have self-chosen seclusion where they&rsquo;re not calling your name: mommy or daddy for those moments. Mr. Lynne used to close himself up in his office and sit down and keep the secretary outside just to feel this quality. That&rsquo;s the real secret of enhancing the Beingness in you. As long as nobody don&rsquo;t punch the program button of your name to attract your attention, it will not drift away or drain away from you, you will always hold it in focus. So when you see someone who is engrossed in it, you know they&rsquo;ve spent a long time working towards where they could acquire a 24 hour a day without any interruption from anyone calling them by their name and it will stay with that person, after awhile it&rsquo;s there with you, it&rsquo;s the living meditation. That&rsquo;s what they mean now &ldquo;the peace that passes all understanding.&rdquo; They can&rsquo;t understand how you can be so happy, so forgiving with all the ridiculous idiosyncrasies that are going on around you, you begin to see the comedy of it. Yet it&rsquo;s in that same state that you have to acquire in order to perform where others failed with the very things that you will perform and make a success. You will take the very same things that others have gone ahead and work it through and make a success of it and others have gone with it and failed and they don&rsquo;t know how they failed and what is it that you&rsquo;ve got that made it a success. They have gone through it with the wrong timing and you&rsquo;re going through it knowing it will fall into place and that you&rsquo;re not pushing it. So you&rsquo;re working with it in that attitude, moment to moment, and it falls in place. Now think back on your life and think of one incident where it just flowed into place and you begin to see you have the model. As my brother would say who I went to visit yesterday, a wonderful man Andy, he said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simple but it ain&rsquo;t easy.&rdquo; (Laughter). See it&rsquo;s simple to tell you about it but it ain&rsquo;t easy to pull it off but this is the intent of spirituality. It&rsquo;s not those who shout &ldquo;Lord, Lord, Lord&rdquo; all the time that are spiritual, it is the one who is merging in the consciousness and getting up to live moment-to-moment in a practical way. Jesus made a remark one time, he said &ldquo;Oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem how I&rsquo;d love to gather you up like a mother hen gathering her chickens.&rdquo; 0:30 This particular statement can best be felt or experienced at a Satsang. The struggling non-initiate and the initiate who is trying to integrate the consciousness from the verbal oscillation to a non-verbal quietude to feel this inner peace is like chickens and the mother hen is the Creative Consciousness trying to pull you away from verbalization in your brain, gather you up. So you don&rsquo;t have this mental struggle verbalizing what you are and what you&rsquo;re not and what&rsquo;s happening to you. So &ldquo;whenever two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in their midst,&rdquo; this is the mother hen-ness of God now hovering over to pull you together to feel a unity. It&rsquo;s like all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle now put back in place and you&rsquo;re seeing the whole picture for the first time. So group meditation was inspired for that basis or for that reason so there could be a sort of intra-cellular connectedness. Those who have the ability to stay longer in the waking state with a sense of peace, by the very principles of the atomic laws that we are atomic in nature, we&rsquo;re an electromagnetic principles, we feed others less magnetic and less electrical and less stabilized and the weak helped by the strong and the strong helped by the Totality then everyone becomes strong. But first the weak is helped by the strong, then the strong is helped by the Totality. One time I went to a prayer meeting on the reservation and we all sat down just like this, it was in Arizona, years ago I used to come up in this area to attend researcher and prayer meetings among the Navajo and the Hopi. One night we&rsquo;re sitting down and the road man, that&rsquo;s a fellow like me, they&rsquo;re calling him the road man, he shows you the road back to the source. I like how they talk because it&rsquo;s so down to earth and the kiva is like a pregnant mother and the earth is the mother so it&rsquo;s like a dome and there&rsquo;s a door you walk in and they say that&rsquo;s the entrance to the umbilical cord. So everyone inside is like unborn children waiting to be born the next day but there we are sitting in the room and the road man makes this comment, he says &ldquo;Brother, we are asked tonight to pray for a loved one who is ill but instead of asking you to do that, to pray for a loved one who is ill, why don&rsquo;t we pray for one another?&rdquo; And he says &ldquo;Now there are 40 people in this room and if one person prays the other 39 and then the other 39 prays back for him, compound this mathematically and see what you get.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re totally bombarded by the end of the night with such healing force, you&rsquo;ll walk out straight.&rdquo; Because if you turn around and look at each one and wishing them the best in their health and everything and then this is flipping back around, it&rsquo;s coming back to you, this whole room is generating a force field. He didn&rsquo;t say pray the eyes closed, &ldquo;look at each other like you&rsquo;re greeting and feel the accentuation of the relationship.&rdquo; Well my experience was very very rewarding because before the morning was over, the person who was lying on the back sick was up straight and walking in full control of their life. Well, but by the same token I&rsquo;m suffering with an ache and a pain in my back from the broken bones and the meeting is over in the morning and I said to him &ldquo;Brother, I&rsquo;d like a healing for myself in another way.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t you put yourself on the floor with the others and let them pray with you?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know I had to do that. He says &ldquo;The meeting is over now and I can&rsquo;t call the people back to pray for you.&rdquo; But I said &ldquo;That is true but you believe and I believe if I pray for me that can work but maybe this trip somebody has to pray for me and let me be humble enough to receive healing.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;But brother the meeting is over.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;What you can do is this, you have the understanding, I have the receptivity. All I would like you to do is reach out and tap the brother Jesus with your left hand, take your right hand and zap me and everybody&rsquo;s going to join and tap in and zap me and I&rsquo;ll accept because I&rsquo;m going to put myself in that (inaudible).&rdquo; So it was difficult to convince my brother that way but he looked around and said &ldquo;All right, never did it before but better try once, you never know.&rdquo; So I went on the floor there and he reached up like that and everyone looked around and this is what he said &ldquo;Dear Father, brother, Christ, here&rsquo;s is a brother who is ill of no reason read we know of except in his own consciousness but our meeting is over according to tradition. I am interceding for him out of love from the heart and all around us here are asking from the love of the heart. Only the heart can release you Father and release him from his misery.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you I felt like a charge of energy rushed right through my body to where that ache was and to this day I don&rsquo;t have it, but on a conscious level. So the conscious meditation, the conscious communion carries tremendous oneness of power is to understand it. As Jesus would say &ldquo;The things I do you will do also and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;lesser things.&rdquo; Remember that, we are all the walking potential of the Spirit but we can sell ourselves short or be egotistical. There are times we can help others, there are times we can help ourselves, and yet there are times we must let others help us. No matter how much we know and how good we can be the favor of the Spirit, there are times we have to let others help us. I&rsquo;ll give an example in my own life. One day at my own clinic I&rsquo;d stubbed by toe and I have a patient who has a little boy that was six years of age and he said &ldquo;Oh Adano, can I rub it for you?&rdquo; By that time, one of my other sisters says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it for you Adano, we know you can do it.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No no let my little friend Jason do it&rdquo; and I put my foot out and Jason took off the stock, got the towel, got the oil, and started rubbing my foot with so much love the pain was gone but to see the expression on Jason&rsquo;s face was the whole joy. In that moment he wanted to do, to feel, and there is where the whole Creative Consciousness works. Now to block such a child from expressing love would have already interfered. 0:40 That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about, on a conscious level at times you have to come down and let the most unusual incident, in a moment any day, in any incident that comes along, just be willing to go with it and experience Spirit at work. Years ago when I studied with Yogananda, I made this argument I said &ldquo;If the Spirit is everything, why can it not enter into daily mundane activity.&rdquo; And I got a letter back from Master who said &ldquo;The daily activity is the incidences that happen and that&rsquo;s where Spirit is and you have to look at it.&rdquo; And the more I became conscious of it in meditation and when I came out of meditation and related to these incidences around me, I realized that the meditation had just begun and that really what I was sitting down and doing was just cleaning up the house and getting it ready for the guest, the unexpected principle to work on a conscious level: seeing it, feeling it, participating in it. Because life is, you see? You want to take a break and come back and ask questions? (Gap in tape). Well I know many of you are initiates and some are friends. You may have lots of questions you want to ask so try it and see if we can solve some of the questions. Audience: You&rsquo;ve been talking about your diet, is there a special cleansing routine you would follow if you had to eat meat. Sometimes certain cultures it would really be an insult if one didn&rsquo;t partake. Adano: It&rsquo;s very difficult to be a non-meat eater if you don&rsquo;t know your blood type, especially living in the western world. You make more mistakes and get sick and then we have more problems. If you know your blood type, that&rsquo;s an asset but Solar Nutrition is a way to eat according to time and therefore once you know the time cycle of every product that is edible, you can eat it. Now a cow doesn&rsquo;t eat another cow but it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be found climbing a tree to eat a fruit, it would be eating grass. And the chicken will be digging for grain in the ground and a fish doesn&rsquo;t come out of the water to climb on top of the land to eat any vegetable. And if you ever went fishing, you&rsquo;re certainly ain&rsquo;t going to catch them in the middle of the day, it&rsquo;s either in the evening or towards morning just before the sunlight goes down and come up. So each one of these creatures has a feeding time and a growing time and an active time or work time. Now if you&rsquo;re going to use them for food and it&rsquo;s not that they shouldn&rsquo;t be used for food, it is the reaction in your chemistry to your body at the time that is toxic to you. At the right time, it&rsquo;s an asset, a little is medicine. So a little of anything is medicine for the system, too much is toxic for the system. The body is designed to process everything in this environment in its different forms because the body carries all 144 elements in it and will process all the different forms around it. But it will process it correctly without any detriment at its correct time. If it is placed in the wrong time then it will start to accumulate and become toxic to the body. So four-legged creatures and two-legged creatures if you want to eat them and Man didn&rsquo;t come on this planet farming and he didn&rsquo;t find the fruit and vegetable orchards waiting for him. They were all thrown together in different areas and you had to go walk and look for it and get lost and be edible for the creature who is hungry like you and he may be two legged or four-legged, see? So it doesn&rsquo;t matter how you survived and you&rsquo;ll notice that we don&rsquo;t ever eat the four-legged creature that eats its own kind, we eat the one that eats vegetables or grass. We eat bear, they don&rsquo;t eat their own kind. We eat sheep, pig, cow, they don&rsquo;t eat their own kind but we don&rsquo;t eat the lion, see what I mean? Now there&rsquo;s a reason why they ate that because these were creatures or the next in line for survival in terms of fruit and vegetables being so scarce. But the fruits and nuts on the trees were assigned to be eaten in the early primal time but because there were no farmers growing it, you had to go look for it in the season it was there. So Man primarily was a hunter evolving to become civilized and cultivated as he is today. In today&rsquo;s time, we have access to every type of food but we don&rsquo;t put it in at the right time and we don&rsquo;t relate to it in its time cycle the way it grows. I once heard a young boy who said &ldquo;milk comes from cartons,&rdquo; he never knew where milk came from but then he found a can with a cow in it in a pile of cans and he told his friends &ldquo;come see where the mother cow is.&rdquo; This was true because he never knew that it came from a cow but he thought they all came from cans. On the trees with nuts in today&rsquo;s time cycle where we live now, they are ideal for breakfast: fruits and nuts. They grow on trees, they get the first light where you are located on the planet and wherever it is grown on the planet, it will get the first light, trees with their fruits and nuts. Now the second degree of light is directly overhead, straight down. Remember fruits and nuts grow on trees. The tallest plant that grows in the middle of the ground directly under the sun shining overhead is a grass called sugarcane. It&rsquo;s not a tree, neither is it a vine yet all vine plants grow on the surface of the ground and imagine for one moment you owning a watermelon orchard. How many watermelons would be in a watermelon tree? Now you wouldn&rsquo;t want to walk under one because the weight of the watermelon will split the tree apart and you don&rsquo;t find exorbitantly large fruits on a tree. The largest fruit you find on the tree would be a papaya or a bread fruit but they wouldn&rsquo;t compete with watermelon. 0:50 Nature grows them on vines, leaves them there and she puts vegetables that grow above the ground and the corn all within a certain light range but then the four-legged creature comes along and that&rsquo;s a cow, he doesn&rsquo;t eat another cow. The sheep comes along, the pig comes along, they&rsquo;re all eating off the ground, the grass. The chickens eat off the ground and at night time we have food that grows under the ground that never gets no sun. All day it grows under the ground, just the tops get sun but the bottom part that is edible doesn&rsquo;t get sun. Could anybody grow a mushroom in sunlight? They&rsquo;ll go broke. Can you grow carrots and expose the carrot to the sunlight? You&rsquo;ll go broke too. The carrots are under the ground, the potatoes are under the ground, the peanut is under the ground, and the fish lives in the darkness of the water and the egg is inside of the chicken. So they are food that is contributive to our existence within another light range, the tops are exposed to the light but the entire portion that is edible for the maximal use is in darkness. Now I eat everything because I know the time but I also know my blood type. Now, a type A and an AB cannot be a hundred percent non-meat eater? Not true, they can be 100% non meat eater, A and AB but they can&rsquo;t be 100% meat eater. So those people who have A or AB blood types plus or minus make wonderful vegetarians but if you were to speak to Yogananda and ask him if he was a vegetarian, he would say &ldquo;a what? I&rsquo;m a proper eat-arian&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s a vast difference between a vegetarian and an eat-arian now. A vegetarian is a person that eats coca-cola and french fries but a proper eat-arian is one who knows what type of food and their chemical balances but doesn&rsquo;t say when, that&rsquo;s the only difference but he knows the chemical balance and he knows how the food is structured. Now Solar Nutrition only goes one step further to put time. A proper eat-arian will be more classified as a macrobiotic eater, one who eats according the structure and the chemistry but not with the time. And a vegetarian the person who would eat anything at the wrong time but we call that a lunar nutritionist. Now knowing the time makes the difference in the enzymic absorption and the body&rsquo;s ability to eliminate and handle it. So years ago when I was sick in the hospital, I only broke my bones, I had no internal malfunction but broken bones and yet everything they fed me, and I was paying good money, I was getting sick and I was overweight. So I could not understand and I asked the doctor &ldquo;how is this that I&rsquo;m paying good money for all this good food and I&rsquo;m still getting sick.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand this Mr. Ley, you don&rsquo;t have malfunction in your body but you&rsquo;ve got broken bones.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yeah, it don&rsquo;t make sense and yet I&rsquo;m overweight too. I can assume my overweight is one of the causes.&rdquo; Then I started to experiment and later I validated the experiment. I have a type O and just like type B, B and O plus or minus, we can&rsquo;t be 100% non-meat eater but we could be 100% meat-eater but meat-eating is not ideal. If you don&rsquo;t know when, you&rsquo;ll get toxic and your body will break down. When I didn&rsquo;t know when to eat meat and as a child I ate meat and then I had my first colonic, I saw what meat eating does to the body. If someone had told me you get worms, I would have said you&rsquo;re crazy but when I saw a tapeworm pass out, then I knew they were correct and that is because of eating incorrectly and not knowing the time and not understanding how the body is functioning to do its elimination. But when I was in the hospital and I started to correct my diet, the first thing I experimented with was an egg. They brought the egg in the morning because it&rsquo;s a typical way of eating in the Western world, eggs and toast and orange juice, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, and bacon. So I ate the egg and pushed away the rest. Since I was paying I could have what is called optional eating and didn&rsquo;t have no malfunction but broken bones, I said to the nurse &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have some eggs again for lunch.&rdquo; But then I ate the egg the first time and I pushed away the rest, at 10 o&rsquo;clock, they feed you in a hospital at 7 AM, right on time, and at 10 o&rsquo;clock right on time, I got gas aches and pains and grumbling but the pain went away. Around 12 o&rsquo;clock they bring the lunch and I asked the nurse &ldquo;Can I have eggs again?&rdquo; She says &ldquo;Sure&rdquo; and brought me eggs and again I ate the eggs and by two o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;m grumbling the pain all over, full of aches and stiffness, groaning and grunting. By that time the nurse thinks I&rsquo;m crazy, &ldquo;these doggone Orientals, they&rsquo;re stupid and they love pain.&rdquo; That was what was going through her mind by them. Then at night time she said &ldquo;What do you want Mr. Ley, another egg?&rdquo; (Laughter). I says, &ldquo;Yes nurse, I&rsquo;ll try another egg.&rdquo; She got me the egg, I ate the egg, and for the first time I felt no pain and I had the first real sleep that night, I was amazed. Next morning I couldn&rsquo;t believe I slept without any pain or any gas reaction. It kind of felt funny to me, &ldquo;How is that? It&rsquo;s only an egg. A whole day I ate egg. Morning I ate it, I had the gas. Middle of the day I ate it, I had the gas. Night time I ate, no gas.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have any connection to why. But the next day I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it again because this could be a fluke.&rdquo; (Laughter). When you&rsquo;re experimenting, you have to work on yourself first because you don&rsquo;t know. Next morning I tried again. Ate another egg, got gas at the same time. Lunch time I ate egg&hellip; By that time the doctor came in and says &ldquo;What are you trying to do Mr. Ley? The nurse tells me you&rsquo;re on some kind of an egg binge.&rdquo; Because they check on you every day. I say &ldquo;Well Doc, I&rsquo;m trying to see which food is compatible to my body.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Oh, what have you discovered so far?&rdquo; I say &ldquo;Well last night I ate the egg and I didn&rsquo;t have no reaction and in the morning and noon I&rsquo;m getting a reaction and even now, this morning breakfast and lunch, I&rsquo;m getting a reaction.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Well that sounds interesting, let me know if you don&rsquo;t get any reaction after you ate it tonight because I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing why it&rsquo;s doing that.&rdquo; I ate it that night, I slept good, next morning no reaction. Bright and early the nurse is there with the egg on the third day and he was there about ten o&rsquo;clock he says &ldquo;How did you out?&rdquo; I say &ldquo;Well last night good sleep. This morning again I just ate the egg at seven o&rsquo;clock and I still got gas.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to examine you&rdquo; and then he took my blood type and he says &ldquo;Well we&rsquo;re gonna keep watch on what you&rsquo;re doing because this seems to be unusual that something like this should do that.&rdquo; The third day, again at night, no reaction of the egg. By that time it dawned on me, where does egg come from? As a child I used to help my mother check the chicken when it&rsquo;s ready to lay an egg and go put it in the box and cover it over in a dark shady spot. 1:00 These things go flying back through your mind, darkness is associated with it, evening is associated, it all starts to pull together. Well I started then breaking down different foods like that and sorting it out. I started with the egg and then bacon, they give you bacon, they give you a toast, they give you orange juice and before you know it the basic breakfast that you would have within a short space of time, I&rsquo;d already cataloged where it was ideal and where it was not ideal. Now this one applied to me but then when you start to look at the formation of things, would it apply to others you don&rsquo;t know until the other person is in the same situation. The bacon was okay in the middle of the day, in the morning and in the night, gas like heck. The eggs were okay at night, the toast was okay in the middle of the day and then I started to realize pigs are four-legged creatures, grain grows like a grass in the middle of the day, and the orange juice is good in the morning. Imagine drinking orange juice and a belly ache in the middle of the day and the nighttime but it&rsquo;s very good in the morning, it grows on trees. I&rsquo;d already worked out the very first basic breakfast of bacon and eggs, orange juice, and toast and then from there one I began to sort all the other foods. Now in Canada they love to pride themselves in knowing that they have the best seafood, Canadian salmon, and they love to feed it to you three times a day as much as you can eat. They remind you, they say &ldquo;Well the British love their kippers in the morning&rdquo; and I found that fish was only good for me at night. In the morning and in the middle of the day I was getting gas and throwing up, it wouldn&rsquo;t stay down. I&rsquo;d have pains and cramps again but at night I&rsquo;d eat the salmon and no problem. Then I began to look at the fish objectively, it&rsquo;s a creature that lives under water in darkness. I look at my own structure, I&rsquo;m originated as marine life, a sperm in darkness. Then gradually when I got out of the hospital and then become interested now in real research and studying and the doctor was very cooperative and then he said to me, his name was Dr. Mason, he says &ldquo;Adano you&rsquo;ll never get rid of your weight until you have a colonic.&rdquo; &ldquo;A what doctor?&rdquo; &ldquo;A colonic.&rdquo; They gave us enemas in the hospital to prepare you for an operation but a colonic was something I never encountered. He says &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re out and they release you, you come to my clinic at home and I have a colon machine and I&rsquo;ll give you colon irrigation.&rdquo; &ldquo;When should I come Doc?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh come on Friday. You&rsquo;ll be released on Monday.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m released on Monday and I said to myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna fast on water.&rdquo; That whole day I fasted on water and I had three healthy bowel movements, boy was I happy. You know, under your own momentum, it&rsquo;s great. You know &ldquo;When thou retreatest into thy innermost chamber&hellip;&rdquo; (Laughter). There you can have the highest prayers for God, prayers of thanks. All right, the next day was Tuesday and I fasted on water and I had again three healthy bowel movements. Wednesday nothing. Thursday nothing but I&rsquo;m fasting. I said &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to see what this doctor is going to tell me now because I know I&rsquo;m cleaned up man, I ain&rsquo;t got nothing in here.&rdquo; Well I walk in, proud in my feelings, and think I got it all straightened out in my head and I see this machine&hellip; Well in those days the machine was really Henry Ford Model T and my friend John here has seen my machine, the model is a little better and productive. They&rsquo;ve come a long way from the original Model T models and I got on his machine and he gave me this colon irrigation and in 15 minutes I was amazed to see what was coming out of my colon, with the equipment you can see it. I said to him &ldquo;Doc, isn&rsquo;t that corn?&rdquo; He stops the machine and he says &ldquo;Yes it is, why?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;But you gave me the okay to eat corn only six weeks ago.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched it since the time when you give the okay and you mean to tell me that&rsquo;s still in me?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I hate to tell you the truth but that&rsquo;s the fact.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Boy I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut from now on.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to assume that I know anything about my body anymore because I fasted for two days straight on water. Monday and Tuesday had three healthy bowel movements and I thought I had it all cleaned up. When I saw that, I am interested in my body now and I want to learn about it just for me. I&rsquo;m willing to pay just to learn my body.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I can lend you all the books, you can read it, come in the clinic and read it and if you&rsquo;re interested in helping yourself to physical therapy, I&rsquo;d be glad to help you and then I can inform you where you can go and take some other studies.&rdquo; Well I was sure interested because I wanted to know now why and then when I saw the worm, it really made me wake up to myself. I was missing the boat, I really didn&rsquo;t know anything and I assumed a lot of things that weren&rsquo;t valid. Until I started cleaning up and really getting down to understanding nature and its operation, I began to see where the scriptures were right. When scripture said &ldquo;Cleanliness is next to Godliness,&rdquo; I used to quote it until I said one day &ldquo;Cleanliness IS Godliness,&rdquo; not next to, it is Godliness. When you clean up your organism, you&rsquo;d be surprised how internally synchronous you are with your environment. Before, you&rsquo;re always going to be off, something always comes in to deviate but then I found that my blood type wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to be a 100% non-meat eater. I tried for years and years to be a 100% non-meat eater, only to end up getting too alkaline. See a Type B and a Type O like my type, if we stay off of meat completely we become alkaline we develop a disease called alkalinosis. This is again &ldquo;a little of something is medicine,&rdquo; none at all it&rsquo;s just as bad and Paul didn&rsquo;t say to Timothy &ldquo;drink a lot of wine for your stomach&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;drink a little for your stomach&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; In those parts of the country, amoebic dysentery was very prevalent so they had to know how to combat it and a little wine for the stomach&rsquo;s sake was how they combated all the different problems of traveling around and trying to live in the country. Now too much is no good and not at all is no good. Nature is peculiar, 100% purity is not valid and 100% degradation is not valid, they tend to converge like a funnel in your mechanism and that&rsquo;s where you begin to realize that everything here is to use but know when. See abstinence is good but we have more sick people from those who try to abstain and overindulgence is bad, just as much you get more sick people from over indulgence. It is when you start to synchronize to the middle path, that&rsquo;s where Buddha came in centuries ago and even today in Christianity you&rsquo;ll see and modern physics it&rsquo;s still the middle path, normal balancing of the chemistry of the body. All right, I tried to stay non-meat eater, I got alkalinosis. Alkalosis is a type of disease where the skin gets very dry and cracks and peels but it doesn&rsquo;t have any weeping material coming out of it. The opposite is acidosis, the skin peels but it weeps like a rash so that&rsquo;s the opposite becoming too acid. The A and the AB if they try to eat meat too long, they develop acidosis but they can stay non-meating all their life and never have the problem. Now B and O, if we try to be non-meat eater all our life we have the problem of alkalinosis but if we use periodically the meat or the fish or the egg to stabilize, we don&rsquo;t have the problem. But then you look at your mother and you look at pregnant people, you remember when the person is pregnant at two or three o&rsquo;clock in the morning they walk over to the refrigerator for an ice cream cone and a pickle, isn&rsquo;t that a fantastic combination at that time of the morning? Other people have all kind of different cravings, we call that lunar nutrition. Simply because nature is striving to maintain a chemical balance in the body, you can eat a certain way and in these odd moments nature knows that the body is either getting too alkaline or too acid and it&rsquo;s going to affect the maturing fetus and innately it directs the consciousness to reach out for these odd combinations to bring stability and then we call that pregnancy type syndromes. That&rsquo;s another pregnancy syndrome, reaching for something like that but it&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way to make a balance in the body and when we check the chemistry, it comes back normal again and we always have to watch it. All right when I decided to look at the timing more effectively and the types, then I realized my problem could be corrected. So I began to eat fruits and nuts in the morning but really modern science says every meal you eat must have protein, carbohydrate, mineral, vitamin, lipid or oil, and liquid and if the meal doesn&rsquo;t conform to this formula, you&rsquo;re suffering from malnutrition. Nature has provided every form of mineral, vitamin, protein, oil, and liquid in each growth cycle to fulfill the requirements of that formula. Like it or not, we&rsquo;re returning back to nature. Protein in the morning, the highest protein comes from a nut. It has no uric acid, it&rsquo;s ideal in the morning after you break the fast and that carbohydrate is from the fruit and the oil is from the nut itself, the lipid. The vitamin and minerals are in the nut and the flesh of the fruit and the liquid is in the flesh of the fruit so the formula is satisfied chemically. Quanta is how much you take in and that is within that framework of science, there&rsquo;s no argument there now we can satisfy ourselves within the framework of one growth cycle but let&rsquo;s look at something more objective than that. Everything has to be broken down in the mouth by the enzymes so you have to masticate your food before it gets into the stomach, there&rsquo;s no teeth there. So where are your teeth located, in your mouth or in your feet? Mouth right? And they&rsquo;re made for breaking down hard products and getting the calcium and building up the action of the jaw. One of the problems in our health in absorbing food is the mechanical action of the jaw, that&rsquo;s why you find people who hurt themselves and the jaw is off, they have problems. So you go in the morning to eat, you need your fruits and nuts, chew to get that jaw to work. Then the middle of the day protein again comes from two sources: seeds, beans, beans and grains combine to make a complete protein. The cow doesn&rsquo;t eat another cow so he doesn&rsquo;t get complete protein by eating his own kind, he gets complete protein by eating the grass and processing it through his organism and then it becomes complete protein to be used by you but it has uric acid to combat and it dies in pain released by the adrenals. So you have a high concentration of adrenalin in the bloodstream plus the uric acid from the animal. Yet nature has made compensation for the absorption, your body will handle it from noon to 6:30 within a whole six hour period for absorption and elimination. But the human body doesn&rsquo;t digest flesh, it&rsquo;s not designed to digest flesh otherwise you&rsquo;ll be digesting your stomach with your hydrochloric acid. Flesh decomposes in the human body by intestinal heat and by chemical reaction which drains off or leaches off the minerals from the tissue of the flesh and then the minerals are utilized for building whatever is needed in the body. By the same token you make uric acid so we do need a little uric acid, too much again no good, and we do make adrenaline and too much again is no good and we do make alcohol and too much again is no good. So to say you&rsquo;re going to live a life where you&rsquo;re not going to drink anything, it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous when nature is manufacturing alcohol right in your body and manufacturing uric acid and adrenaline and lactic acid in the body. But it&rsquo;s a quanta and the time that the body needs it to use it and phase it off and your blood type is the important thing. So you can eat a little of the meat from the four-legged creature and the fowl in the middle of the day but nature knowing that can&rsquo;t leave you like that, nature came before you as the Creative Intelligence and put you together last but it is leaving you to find out by suffering, which is your teacher. I&rsquo;m not your teacher, your teacher&rsquo;s name is Mr. Suffering, that&rsquo;s the name of our teacher and his wife is Mrs. Love, that obedience is love and if you listen to Mama you don&rsquo;t get hurt but if you don&rsquo;t listen to Papa you really get hurt. So Daddy is the teacher in the form of suffering and Mama is the teacher in the form of love. So Yogananda says it&rsquo;s easy to love God by following the laws of nature and not hurting yourself too much and that&rsquo;s why he says God is Mother but if you really want to find out God as Father, then this will be the laws and run into suffering and then you learn the hard way, that&rsquo;s Daddy&rsquo;s way. Okay a little is medicine, too much no good, and none at all is no good either because the body is out of context. If you eat the chicken and the meat in the middle of the day for protein or you eat the seeds and the beans and the grains for protein, the seeds and the grains will not give you the uric acid content. 1:20 If you eat the flesh which doesn&rsquo;t digest but decomposes, you&rsquo;ll have the acid content but how is nature going to compensate for that? Nature can&rsquo;t just leave you like, there&rsquo;s a compensation. So nature provides you fruit and she provides the malic acid in the fruit for the cleansing of the uric acids, &ldquo;an apple a day will keep the doctor away.&rdquo; What does an apple contain? Malic acid but apples grow on trees, you mean to tell me if only the malic acid is found in apples, you&rsquo;d starve if you can&rsquo;t find an apple tree any place if you&rsquo;re dying from a certain toxification? So malic acid must be found in other foods of different growth cycles, it&rsquo;s found in the grape. So you have your grape, you can use that for you malic acid but it&rsquo;s perfectly balanced. So a little wine for your stomach&rsquo;s sake after you had your little meat or you take a little schnapps, that sets the pace of elimination from the meat and the toxicity and therefore the decomposition and its effect doesn&rsquo;t stay too long and pushes it out. But when you go beyond a certain quanta, then you&rsquo;re making the body more sick, just a little for the stomach&rsquo;s sake. All right nighttime comes now but you have a longer length of light range from mid-day to 6:30 or 7 o&rsquo;clock where you can eat this heavy protein from flesh and the body will process it. The maximal time is four hours for flesh so you have six hours so you know it&rsquo;s going to process with a little wine for the stomach&rsquo;s sake, you&rsquo;re cleaning it out or any fruit but late in the afternoon you need to flush out. Besides grapes, nature has provided you fruit with the largest quantity of liquid for your organs that need to be flushed at that time and that is the melons and the cantaloupes for flushing the kidney and the blood. The kidneys have to be flushed and they have to flush out uric acid, the blood has to flush out uric acid and you need that in the form of fruit. You need the potassium to flush it and you need the malic acid in the grapes. So you know now nature couldn&rsquo;t leave you like that, why would she make all these creatures and knowing fully well who&rsquo;s going to obey in the first place when disobedience is the principle of evolution. Obedience is not a principle of evolution, you give anybody something and ask them to obey, you&rsquo;ll never get any work done but tell them they can&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;ll see how fast they get the job done. In my clinic what I said to the girls, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t operate this place when I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; you should see them operating it when I&rsquo;m gone because that&rsquo;s what triggers the consciousness to work. You have to give them a challenge and they&rsquo;re going to prove to me that they can operate the place if I&rsquo;m not there but if I&rsquo;m there, what happens? Everybody is going to phase off and do his own thing, it&rsquo;s law of life but it works. So night food now comes in and nature has to provide us and she knows we&rsquo;re gonna go off and she provides seafood, egg, and vegetables under the ground. Again we need protein to form the formula: marine life has protein, potatoes have protein, peanuts have protein. Now for the non-meat eater look what protein he has, potatoes and nuts right? And for the meat eater what has he got? Egg and marine life so they are both satisfied by nature, again it&rsquo;s the time and the quanta. Yet nature has to provide some way to compensate, to clean that body out. If you eat too much marine life and too much egg, you&rsquo;re gonna get toxic so nature has to provide some fruit again, a fruit to clean that. But the fruit now has a different type of material for cleaning it, it has bromine. It doesn&rsquo;t grow on a tree and it doesn&rsquo;t grow on a vine. The bromine family are like a cactus so the pineapple is a cactus, bromine, and that is the cleansing action for the seafood or the egg in the body now. So before you go to bed at night, a little pineapple juice to clean it out. By the same token you need a little nip for your stomach&rsquo;s sake, nature ain&rsquo;t going to leave you without having something to take and in the bromine family she gives you the maguey plant, it&rsquo;s called tequila. All right, that shows you I can eat the flesh products and take care of the consequences within its own light cycle. I have protein, I have carbohydrate, I have minerals, vitamins, and I have the lipids and the juice. Okay every doctor says that the man came to him and told them he&rsquo;s not virile enough and the wife is complaining and the doctor says I suggest that you go home and have a bowl of oysters. So the wife cooks him up a bowl of oysters and he&rsquo;s very virile. Marine life, high in what? Iodine, high in the vitamin E. The chemistry of the night foods are already set up by nature for certain parts of the anatomy. The regenerative organs are in between the legs, when they go off in their hormone balance, the DNAs and RNAs are off, you&rsquo;re not going to find too many foods having the chemistry to match it outside marine life and therefore a little sardine comes in with the highest content of DNAs and RNAs but sardines where do they live, where do they grow? In the darkness of the ocean, they&rsquo;re marine life. Now look at your own structure, are you a composite of two sperms or a composite of two ovums? We are a composite of a sperm and an ovum. The basic chemistry that keeps these things going are long integrated within their cycle, how they will extract it from the body when the parents are eating. So there&rsquo;s no way we can seem to get around nature&rsquo;s own natural operation, we might as well synchronize with nature. One of the benefits of synchronizing with the way nature sets everything to go by light and eat by light is health, everything starts to digest properly and eliminate properly and the doctor told me once, she said, &ldquo;Adano, if you eat three times a day&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="1984-april-20---flagstaff">1984 April 20 - Flagstaff</h2>
<p>Adano84_04_20FlagstaffQ3NW1 - Your five senses are telling God to listen, it is God residing in the heart telling your five senses to listen and it&rsquo;s God who&rsquo;s making a promise from within the heart of life that it will not forsake you or forget you. So that is the important relationship, all this going on between the consciousness, God. We, in our five senses can be so distracted and forget and we may forsake the Creative Principles embodied in our hearts, but the Creative Principle embodied in us cannot forget or forsake us. We can go all over in our consciousness but (inaudible). No matter what you do with your five senses and how you might rely or want to punish yourself with your five senses, your Creative Principle embodied in you doesn&rsquo;t punish or judge you. It gives you more love to realize your true self all the time. That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t forget your nor forsake you, and though the tribulations and the confrontations and the aggravations may seem to pile up, they&rsquo;re only the roles in our lives. Your logical mind may get threatened with it and your imagination will go a little off at times from the fear of it, but deep down that heart and love is telling you it doesn&rsquo;t forget you or forsake you, that&rsquo;s the current between the Creative Life and the Soul. That&rsquo;s why all the teachers are individuals who realize themselves (inaudible) and why they say &ldquo;turn the other cheek&rdquo; (inaudible). In the end you do come to grips with this reality that you are intrinsically and essentially Creative Life locked up in the cell and formed, playing different roles through the five senses and the unfinished sensory behavior is what we call the continuing karmic debt. There are no sins, that is the old pre-agricultural way of talking to yourself. As you unfold in consciousness and understanding and love, you realize that all is Creative Life. There&rsquo;s even a song in today&rsquo;s environment, &ldquo;love is like a rose that emerges out from under the snow when the spring comes and kisses it.&rdquo; (Inaudible). The difference between spirituality and religious behavior, religious behavior is content to be fanatical, overly ritualistic and at times very impractical. Spirituality is the moment-to-moment practical application of love for your fellow Man and yourself. There is no superiority in spirituality, it&rsquo;s all (inaudible), spirituality is that unified field. The relative individuality of your five senses, this constantly must play the role of desire. Nothing is wrong with desire, it&rsquo;s only the things you attach yourself to that you desire and feel cannot be replaced once they are broken or lost that you can&rsquo;t do without them. Then the anguish begins. Creative Intelligence generates desire all the time but the anguish and the attachment (inaudible), the frustration sometimes the misery, the fears, and the doubts. And yet if you&rsquo;re capable of letting go of the brain and synchronizing with your heart, eventually you live to see the reality of the experience where the heart triumphs over the (inaudible). But the period of waiting to see it happen can be very frustrating and at times you may wish that you never went through it. You may say to yourself, &ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s your privilege to make those statements in your five senses because it&rsquo;s a discovery of yourself and no one can tell you how to discover yourself. They may show you how to drive a car but until you get behind the wheel and take the responsibility of being certified to drive that car, you are not responsible yet. Many of us go through life as a passenger in a car and never get behind the wheel. Many of us know how to drive and don&rsquo;t own a car but when you know how to drive and own the car, take the full responsibility or commitment to the joy of being, this is realization. That&rsquo;s why the teacher can&rsquo;t be above the student and the student can&rsquo;t be above the teacher. Everyone discovers his internal love in the bond between the Creative Intelligence and the Soul. The five senses you can often wander away from the source of your love by the attachment but the source of love that feeds the desire, feeds the five senses, cannot forsake you or forget you, it has to be there. And when everything is said and done and even when we take our birthday into the invisible, some people like to call that transition or other kinds of names. I&rsquo;d rather call it birthday into the invisible, the ongoing love is still there. You come to grips, you come to face the actual core of your love, that it never left you, it always was you, and continues to be you. 0:10 That&rsquo;s why like Paul would say &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord&rdquo; meaning he is referring to the pursuit of the five senses and thinking that&rsquo;s where the love is and can be distracted from the core of the love and get lost in it and never realize where it&rsquo;s coming from. Yet he was able to disengage from the five senses and experience the inward origin, the inward bond of love between the five senses and the Life Principle. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;live and die&rdquo; meaning he was able to engage through five senses and disengage from the five senses and see the continuity of this love that doesn&rsquo;t forsake or forget but it doesn&rsquo;t condemn nor punish. We do that to ourselves by our own sensory programming. So when you sing the chant, it&rsquo;s more than a chant, it is an eternal promise of Creative Life to the Soul. Every time we take on the form of manifestation or individuality, we can lose this memory or identification within the sensory nature but if we reflect upon how we&rsquo;re put together structurally, the promise or the bond is enhanced more and more. That is why, if you&rsquo;re familiar with Yogananda, when he had the experience of inward consciousness he asked his teacher one day &ldquo;When will I find God?&rdquo; His teacher said &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not looking for somebody sitting on a throne in some antiseptic corner of the universe.&rdquo; Because most of us will build up that type of a relationship. I remember one time I was told that when you go to the heaven you have to pass through the the pearly gates. I passed through the pearly gates only to find on the other side of the pearly gates a vast mountain of empty oyster shells, and when I was told the way to hell was through the fiery gates, I went through the fiery gates of hell I saw on the other side green green pasture lands of chopped down wood waiting be to be burnt. So all the illusions of these words flew out of the consciousness and brought me back to the reality of love but it was my own self-images that I was feeling and not the true principle underlying it. So when Yogananda asked his teacher when he will find God, he said he hoped he wasn&rsquo;t looking for somebody on a throne but &ldquo;if you feel the joy or the love embodied every moment you sit down to meditate, its ever-newness is your contact with the reality of it.&rdquo; It is your own kinesis, your own fountainhead, your own internal spring that feeds individuality and folds back down into a unified process. It is like a drop of water falling into the ocean, when it enters the ocean it loses its shape and becomes the whole ocean then it cries out to be a drop. Even though it&rsquo;s wet like the ocean and its wetness wouldn&rsquo;t differ from the ocean, it still wants its shape as a drop. And the wind may satisfy the little drop to keep its shape by cooling down the ocean and turning it into ice and then the wind again may get so hot to cause the ocean to evaporate and form vapor and then the clouds will get so heavy, they&rsquo;ll collapse and down come the drops. Yet intrinsically a drop of water, frozen water as ice, fog, rain, the intrinsic nature is still H2O, hydrogen and oxygen. And that&rsquo;s really the baseline of the love of why we sing this song from within ourselves, &ldquo;Listen, listen to my heart song,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s Creative Intelligence telling its creation to listen. We can&rsquo;t see Creative Intelligence, we have to hear It and It takes shape as ideas or geometry. We call it inventiveness, the capacity to cope with the difficulty in a practical manner and the obvious because so obvious at the most critical moment which we call the willpower, the timing in our daily lives, it stands out. Then that reality of spirituality begins to guide you moment-to-moment with inspiration or creative ideas. You begin to feel a sense of practical-ness taking over, a sense of strength permeating and fortifying you. We call it the peace that passes all understanding which the man Jesus said &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; The world gives you six feet under the ground, a nice block over your head, and &ldquo;may you rest in peace&rdquo; but the Creative Consciousness in a living mechanism gives you a strength of peace by reawakening the bond between the Creative Life and the five senses and to tap it is to listen. That&rsquo;s why we say &ldquo;Listen listen to the heart song,&rdquo; listen to the eternal rhythms or you may call it Shatki or bio-feedback. Whatever name we want to call Creative Life, we have to listen to it because it&rsquo;s the Audible Life Stream locked up in the cells. Modern science calls it white noise yet it takes on various geometrical patterns that intensifies the yearning of a magnetic effects of our mechanism to gravitate to it. And that is called the love, that intense pull between the form and the flow. So just &ldquo;listen listen to the heart song&rdquo; and Creative Intelligence will not forget or forsake you, that is the sensory consciousness talking to itself as a sense of Beingness or love. When Yukteswar reappeared to Yogananda, Yogananda asked him &ldquo;are there other realms to life?&rdquo; And Yukteswar said &ldquo;the one thing that our consciousness never loses even though we merge in the ocean of unity of all life, we never lose the sense of individuality&rdquo; and in the atomic physics we see that even at the subatomic particles. Even though they&rsquo;re all moving in that unified state, your sense of individual particles are existing. Your sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; never leaves you even when we go out of the frame at the last breath, even when we seem to fall asleep and dream, the sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; never seems to leave you. 0:20 Even when you have an out of body experience, that is the sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; traveling out on the carbon dioxide when you respirate or expire the breath, that sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; still doesn&rsquo;t go away and that is what Paul is saying &ldquo;I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; The &ldquo;I,&rdquo; that sense of individuality is deeply ingrained in the Life Principle, it keeps reminding you of the bond between the Creative Intelligence and your five senses and it does not forget or forsake. Even though the frame of the form is different, different types of confrontations, those confrontations are the essential hurdles in the racetrack that the horse must jump over in order prove itself that it can jump. So one great Saint said, &ldquo;The greater the obstacle, the greater the man.&rdquo; No obstacle, a weak man. And &ldquo;Necessity is the mother of invention,&rdquo; we find without the pressures that force us to move in the direction of &ldquo;want&rdquo; and &ldquo;me,&rdquo; we don&rsquo;t seem to generate creativeness. When we look around ourselves, from history to today, from the agricultural to the mechanical into space, we see this pattern very powerfully dominating out lives, but the attachment over the years tends to diminish the spirituality and tries to enhance the churchianistic qualities, there is where we fool ourselves. Nothing is wrong with the church itself as a means of gathering, but when we become fanatical in the ritualistic behavior of it then we destroy the spirit in ourselves. We need to know what is the spiritual part of us all the time. I&rsquo;m happy to be here tonight for three reasons: one, you are here. The &ldquo;you&rdquo; and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the &ldquo;me&rdquo; are three words in the language of all mankind and that enhances love. And it&rsquo;s only between our forms can this enhancement be felt. That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rdquo; are here and between the &ldquo;you&rdquo; and the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; (inaudible) refer to ourselves as &ldquo;me&rdquo; and that &ldquo;me&rdquo; part of you goes with me wherever I go so I take you with me. The second reason I am happy to be here, for the many years that I&rsquo;ve known Ruth and our wonderful Margaret here, I&rsquo;ve always promised to be coming through this area to see them but they always promised to come and see me. So it works out that I&rsquo;m coming to see them more often now. (Laughter). (Gap in tape). If you have any questions. Audience: I&rsquo;ve heard that the heart in Yogic philosophy is not always the same thing as the pump that we have, that it&rsquo;s a spiritual heart. Is that accurate? Adano: It&rsquo;s both the spiritual pump and focal point for the internal energies. In Yoga which means union&hellip; when Jesus said &ldquo;The pure in heart will see God,&rdquo; most of us take off into psychological references to a biological organ and often get carried away with erroneous action of the experience, not realizing what is really going on in the dynamics of the structure at the atomic level. But if we unite both the psychological function with the biological function, then the real truth is revealed for the first time. Only within the human organ called heart is there an exchange between the artery and the vein, in no other part of the anatomy is this exchange occurring. And &ldquo;pure in heart&rdquo; means the body has to be in a toxic free state so the minimal input of toxic food would toxify the bloodstream forcing the pump to overwork and would make your body sick. So if you put a high quantity, which is going to be sick, a minimum quantity you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to experience subtle qualities of your own organism. So the cellular purification, and the heart is designed to purify, that&rsquo;s why it is designed as a pump at the same time, when the exchange occurs between the artery and the vein, it triggers an electric spark at the pituitary area causing the retina to shift its focus from concave to convex thereby providing you the opportunity to see through mass instead of only seeing AT a mass. Now seeing through is seeing God, the Atomic Principle as it is manifested in form. Seeing AT is the petrified or catalyzed state for which we think we are inhibited and can get through to. 0:30 So when the eyes look at this object, they only see at the surface of it and the unusual ability of seeing through it, they&rsquo;re often called weirdos and extra sensory when that&rsquo;s basically a part of the structure for the body with a non-toxic state to be able to see through the apparent relative mass right into its atomic structure. So the comic strip x-ray vision of Superman is not restricted only to Superman, it is a natural function locked up in all of us. That&rsquo;s why Jesus would say &ldquo;When the eyes are single, the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; Now this is a valid fact that can be experienced at the biological level and from the initiation of those would be initiated into the science of internal observation, you go right back and then at organ the heart is gradually transmuted and feeding this phenomenon inside. Eventually the heart takes over the operation of the optic nerves to permit this phenomena to occur instead of the right and left hemispheres of the brain dominating the sensory behavior but you have to work with it until this experience takes over and becomes permanent in you. You may start out with it, sometimes some of us bump our heads and see stars or other various ways we may run into the experience but the rational route is via the heart which is set up already to do the cleansing. So nature has left us the actual mechanics in the environment for us to pursue an experience. When we go to these natural methods, we only find one requirement and that requirement is cleaning the cells up, there is no other requirement for it and it&rsquo;s not cleaning up in terms of being more holier than thou, it&rsquo;s because anytime you attempt to clean the body, you have to change your attitude. Otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t clean it either so the two are co-related to each other right away. Anytime you&rsquo;re feeling sick about eating too much of something, you have to tell yourself you&rsquo;re going to quit doing it so one without the other wouldn&rsquo;t work now, they have be together. So it&rsquo;s a biological cleansing with a psychological alignment that brings the heart into focus causing this electrical spark to react on the pituitary and we have the experience of convex vision or third-eye vision and it open up. Then from that point when it opens up, we can see into the atomic structure the sense of &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and this is the real &ldquo;I&rdquo; now which is referred to by Moses when he was looking the burning bush, &ldquo;I am that I am.&rdquo; This pulls up in the head from this portion of the pituitary gland into the pineal gland now so you&rsquo;ll shift into the actual source of the atomic energy. They call it the thousand petal lotus and given all these names, but intrinsically it is that electric spark in the mechanism. In the ancient days they never used the word electric, they always used to say (inaudible) but that was their way of trying to describe a biological reaction of the electromagnetic level. And this here suddenly gets extremely cool and bright, it is there where Jesus is saying now, &ldquo;The light is shining in the darkness.&rdquo; Darkness being the five senses now, externally related and not internally related, externally looking AT, that&rsquo;s the darkness. The light is shining in it and as you keep looking in and you feel it pulling, the whole body becomes full of light. &ldquo;And the light is shining in the darkness and the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; &ldquo;But let the light so shine,&rdquo; keep on looking, don&rsquo;t interfere, don&rsquo;t analyze, don&rsquo;t bring intellect into play, listen and watch. &ldquo;Let that light so shine before Man,&rdquo; that means your cells become permeated now with the glow from inside taking over the immune level of the cells, restoring their balance, and permitting you to function more on time, which is Divine Will, in your environment. So you&rsquo;re always there at the right time, for the right experience and no experience is good or bad, it&rsquo;s just an opportunity to go through. From then on you are synchronized. As Carl Jung would say &ldquo;you have found the synchronicity of your nature,&rdquo; this pineal gland then moves you into your environmental field. Then it starts coming downwards, first you go up into it, we call it ascending into heaven and you sit at the right hand of the Father (inaudible). Then it descends down into the core of its throne in the heart. That&rsquo;s where they say the sacred heart takes over. Until it descends down here, there is no biological transmutation of this body ever becoming non-corruptible or non-decaying. The non-decaying result of this body is the actual ascent and return to the heart in a biological way. So it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s only psychological from the attitude we have to it, it&rsquo;s already locked up biologically as a caterpillar who eats his way to the butterfly-hood. So it is a biological transmutation that occurs within you that the Yogi, which means a unified conscious person, senses now the ascent and descent to the heart. That&rsquo;s why they call it the sacred heart and that was not evidence until Jesus returned from the grave and demonstrated the resurrection, that they referred to the sacred heart. It is not a psychological condition alone, it&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s dynamically organic. But when we say organic, we tend to limit it from the fact that we see things falling apart organically, never giving it the realization until we see objects that transform and transmute to the non-brain (inaudible). So when this body puts off corruption and the decomposition of frequencies and takes on the non-decompositional or the non-corrupted state, it is truly the glory or highest quality of the Creative Self, a glory unto God. You have to live this experience. Many of us come through and realize it and in the process of transmuting and transforming and go on only to leave it as evidence, you can&rsquo;t transform it before we go through it. So that&rsquo;s one of the problems with it, the butterfly can&rsquo;t be a butterfly before the caterpillar decides to quit being a caterpillar. Equally true, until I decided to quit using my five sense to function here, I can&rsquo;t have evidence of a transmutation occurring in me. So this is the open door, organically setup but the fears and frustrations are always going to be there because you&rsquo;re uninformed and it&rsquo;s always a new experience in each body-form until we become familiar with its mechanics. 0:40 That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time&rdquo; and this may be my millionth second time so the point is I must overcome the fear and the frustration of the uniqueness of this form in this time lapse to experience what is locked up in it apparently by the Creative Intelligence. So if we seem to repeat the process and things seem familiar in ourselves, it is because we have to go through it in order to get this level so that it&rsquo;s pointed out in an objective intellectual way, it&rsquo;s able to take over and transfer from brain (inaudible). We can then go on knowing it&rsquo;s not a churchianistic approach that is required to transformation, it&rsquo;s a practical approach of moment-to-moment living that brings this internal transformation and we must focus upon the bottom line of the connectedness (inaudible). We start off, we ascend, and we come back in, that&rsquo;s where we terminate, in the heart. So the Yogis are telling us that the journey seems to move from here to here and come back here. It&rsquo;s not only psychological, it&rsquo;s also biological but biological into the extent of the atomic level. Does that answer your question? So as a good friend of mine says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell yourselves short.&rdquo; (Laughter). Audience: Would you talk to us about thoughts? I always thought if I didn&rsquo;t accept someone else&rsquo;s beliefs or thoughts and sort of blocked them off, they couldn&rsquo;t affect me. I found that that&rsquo;s not true so how do we protect ourselves when we&rsquo;re not really aware that someone is even thinking about us? Adano: When we don&rsquo;t understand how we&rsquo;re constructed, another person&rsquo;s thoughts will affect us in spite of ourselves but once we understand how we&rsquo;re put together, the other person&rsquo;s thought is their own thought already. Let me explain that. When Creative Intelligence made the universe, It created the environment first and all 144 elements were here. That&rsquo;s why they said &ldquo;In the beginning WAS,&rdquo; not &ldquo;in the beginning IS&rdquo; and if you understand the language structure, &ldquo;was&rdquo; is past tense and &ldquo;is&rdquo; is present tense, the word. Therefore all sonic labels of all forms of creative energy in their different forms were here. &ldquo;And the Word WAS God.&rdquo; This creative environment was its own creative potential. Now you and I ain&rsquo;t in the picture as yet, the threads of naked thought are in the picture but the thought isn&rsquo;t woven yet. So we aren&rsquo;t woven together yet to have any manifestation. &ldquo;And the Word WAS God and the Word was made flesh.&rdquo; Now we&rsquo;re woven together to have manifestation. &ldquo;And dwells in Man.&rdquo; Dwells in the manifestation. The Creative Intelligence of the atomic principles was here at a very high frequency or velocity and in the process of slowing down, it appeared as evolution. When it didn&rsquo;t slow down and was invisible, it&rsquo;s in a state of involution. Now the argument is not between evolution and creation, the argument is between evolution and involution so therefore there is no such thing as this not being a creation. This is a creation comprising of involution and evolution. Involution is the invisible speed of what we see, evolution is the visible speed of what we see. That&rsquo;s where the argument is going on with people who will say this universe is not evolution, this universe is creation, that&rsquo;s erroneous. It is creation but the argument is in the two rates of speed of the creation, the visible speed and the invisible speed. (Gap in tape) &hellip; a pre-agricultural language statement. Taken in today&rsquo;s mechanical language &ldquo;As you see it operating in the visible range, so it is already operating in the invisible range and therefore can be validated by instrumentation.&rdquo; We have come this far to have instruments to validate. In ancient times Man&rsquo;s only instrument he had to validate was his awakening of the invincible nature of the internal &ldquo;I,&rdquo; creating what is known as convex vision, the ability to see through the mass that limited him. He had to go inward to activate it. Well we&rsquo;ll find that any time out of a thousand people, we only find one person who is doing it. So the other 999 are going to be kind of fearful and very adoring, calling him God or something and that could carry on for many many centuries. Until some other person says &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t believe what you see is true and develops some kind of a machinery and ends up saying &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Then everybody here, 999, look through &ldquo;You see what he just said? It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; So science now comes along to prove what the one prophet or prophesizing individual has said without the means of instruments, that that part is there. Now when this Creative Intelligence made this manifestation and the environment, the last thing He made was a human being, right or wrong? If He made the human being first before He made the environment, where would He put it? And if He made the human being last after he made the environment, who is more important? Audience: &ldquo;The last shall be first.&rdquo; Adano: Ah! Now you see where the term comes from, &ldquo;first is last and last is first&rdquo; because when you make the first, you have to make quantity cater to the last which would have to provide quality. You can&rsquo;t make a million human beings right away if you don&rsquo;t have enough supply to feed them all right off the bat, logically it can&rsquo;t work. So you&rsquo;d have to create a vast environmental field, self-perpetuating, to nurture one pair that must move on to generate the quality. 0:50 All right, the thought, where does it come from? If you go back to the structure we see, God made Man and this is what it says &ldquo;Come let Us make Man.&rdquo; That means after everything else has been made now, the final decision is &ldquo;come let Us make Man.&rdquo; Then how are we going to make him, what is he going to look like, how is he gonna function? This is a conversation between &ldquo;Us,&rdquo; not a conversation between the &ldquo;I&rdquo; or between a &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Us&rdquo; is plural. This &ldquo;Us&rdquo; being plural is the evolutionary level and the involutionary level of the mass, the two different speeds of the mass within their own atomic structure. &ldquo;Come let Us,&rdquo; Creative Intelligence as a thought process sets up Its own intrinsic polarity to crystallize into form. &ldquo;In Our own image and likeness&rdquo; and what is the image? The image is the atomic structure and the likeness is the perpetuation and continuity of the atomic structure. Therefore the product must carry these two qualities automatically at the onset, it cannot say it doesn&rsquo;t possess it, it does possess it. &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness.&rdquo; All right but then it goes on to differentiate the polarity, &ldquo;male and female created He them.&rdquo; Now look around in this room and look at yourself structurally, you are not the result of two sperms nor the result two ovums. Biologically you are the result of a sperm and an ovum and losers cannot be born and the chances of human birth are millions to one as you say in that TV program where they show that many sperms are trying to innovate with the ovum to be a human being so it&rsquo;s fantastic. When we look at your form, what tremendous forces were pulling for your success but then we sell ourselves short or c-e-l-l-s, that&rsquo;s the one we sell short. We presuppose s-e-l-f, that&rsquo;s the one that can really sell you short in reality to the c-e-l-l but if you begin to structurally look at it there now, thought is going to appear from there. The winning-ness is inherent but it cannot be turned off, it can be turned down and in the turning down after it has accomplished the fact of being a form, it may not be able to turn it up again. It may forfeit the ability to turn it up and it may talk itself into the ability to not be able to turn it up and it will continue to feel depressed or im-pressed by other forms projecting their winning-ness. So once you realize that their winning-ness is your winning-ness and the two winning-ness is equal to the same thing, then they don&rsquo;t have any effect on you. It is you who give it effect by not turning back up your winning-ness so you keep enhancing the fear of the losing-ness and the frustration of the losing-ness so that takes over and makes you feel weaker and weaker and you can&rsquo;t seem to shut out the effect of another person&rsquo;s verbalization of their ideas. But if you recognize where your strength comes from, where the bond between your form and the Creative Intelligence is locked in, it&rsquo;s not possible anymore for another individual to invade or affect the reservoir of (inaudible) in you. You have to relate to the origin of your structure, how you&rsquo;re put together and then you break their effect. Now they are winners too, otherwise they would not be a human form, you have to respect their right to be a winner and you have to respect your right as a winner too. But if you don&rsquo;t recognize the two winning-ness and the cause of the two winning-ness, then their strength will seem to penetrate yours and you&rsquo;ll feel weak. Now winners don&rsquo;t have fear because they don&rsquo;t win, losers have fear but losers can&rsquo;t be born. You can be turned down in your winning-ness but not turned off, it&rsquo;s the matter of recognizing it to turn it back up, it&rsquo;s like the volume of the radio. Now, &ldquo;Male and female created He them&rdquo; and God, this Creative Principle, &ldquo;breathed breath of life into Man and Man became living Soul.&rdquo; Man doesn&rsquo;t have Soul. If he did have Soul, it would be pretty preposterous for a human body to save it, from what? What can the human body save the Soul from if it HAS Soul? This manifestation, male and female in polarity through a sperm/ovum bonding process of the matrix from the environmental field, is Soul. The Soul integrity of the Creative Intelligence walking in the universe, a winner all the time, not taking advantage of no situation but emphasizing the winning-ness of the accomplishment of the Creative Intelligence. This pattern frees you from any negative feedback of people generating what they have to say because when they say something negative to you with their voice and you think it&rsquo;s negative to you after you&rsquo;ve heard it, it is only because you don&rsquo;t know how to turn that resonance around to make it non-negative. I&rsquo;ll give you an example because anytime someone is born, he&rsquo;s forced to use language to communicate. All right, do you speak English? Audience: Yes. Adano: Good. I&rsquo;m going to say to you now (Adano speaks in a foreign language). You understand me? Audience: No. Adano: Good, then I don&rsquo;t affect you. (Adano speaking French). You understand? If it is French or Spanish it&rsquo;s good to see that what could affect and what possibly may generate a false effect (inaudible). Until you have a relationship with the sonics, it has no effect, but if you have a relationship it is because you have made the identification with what those things appear to represent to you. Then you&rsquo;ll put it in a polaristic way of being right or wrong or good or bad to your mechanism after you&rsquo;ve heard it. So this is one way you realize why it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your neighbors say. They may call you any kind of name, it don&rsquo;t matter. The point that I&rsquo;m trying to get at is that they have to say something in the vibratory rate that you are familiar with, that you lock into and relate to, to have a feedback. Then it will weaken you or not but until then it doesn&rsquo;t have an effect on you. If you feed it with doubt that it has an effect, it will keep on doing that. It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re starting to deny within you the reality that you&rsquo;re a winner and if you don&rsquo;t feed that, then it doesn&rsquo;t have effect on you. 1:00 I&rsquo;ll give you an example of a thought pattern like that. Several years ago a trade man went from this country to Japan to get the Japanese to lower their expectation and keep it within a certain quota. As a rule when an ambassador of the United States arrived or any government official arrived in Japan, the presiding official, to show the respect and the accorded appreciation would immediately have the person in charge greet the visitor and have a cup of tea to break the pressure of the communication. When this ambassador arrived, no such thing happened. He was out in the office waiting and there he waited and waited and he realized something was not typical of the communication between the two people. So he began to say in his own mind that &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; This became his mental thought process, &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; A whole hour went by and the Japanese ambassador did not show up, the Japanese ambassador was delaying the confrontation. At the end of the hour they ushered in the American ambassador and in a very cold manner the Japanese ambassador is going through (inaudible) and then he ordered tea. They brought tea but in the meantime the American ambassador is saying in his brain all through the period of the negotiation &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; Well the conference is over, the documents are signed, and reduction was agreed on, and they bid goodbye and he was getting ready to get on his plane. So when the American ambassador arrived at the airport and he&rsquo;s getting ready to enter the plane, lo and behold they heard a siren coming down the airport and it was the Japanese ambassador&rsquo;s car and out stepped the liaison officer with a package and the package was for the American ambassador from the Japanese ambassador to be opened onboard the plane. The American ambassador took the package, got into the plane, and when the plane left the ground he opened the package and this was what was inside: two cups and the little flask that the tea was served in and a card that says, &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; (Laughter). There is where thoughts interphase on each other. We have access to this particular process of locking out negative and turning it into positive. So whenever you hear or feel someone is inter-phasing on you and you feel the drain, always remember the Christ Principle is the winning principle in you. And that&rsquo;s why Jesus says &ldquo;Turn the cheek.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a literal psychophysiological mechanism that we must do to bring about this transmutation. When you do that, you start to see the reaction occurring but you have to have the challenge in order to find out if you can stick it out. We would love to have a pain-free environment but you know a pain-free environment is not a healthy environment, the greater the obstacle, the greater the person. That&rsquo;s why eastern Yogis teach you yoga, mantra, or prayer unceasingly, every type of a way to (inaudible) actual words or programming to inhibit the effect. Now getting deeper into the structure of being, &ldquo;God breathed breath of life into Man and Man became living Soul.&rdquo; Breath of life enters you as the air and within that air there are many gases and there is only one gas that has the unique capacity to produce this phenomenon called consciousness by the ability to make this organism dilate and constrict. Every other gas will kill it and the only gas that can produce this phenomenon to dilate and constrict and make it feel it&rsquo;s alive through the dilation and constriction is oxygen. Now, you breathe in oxygen right? And therefore you feel you breathe out carbon dioxide, good. While the oxygen is inside of you, everything that you would think up would be exposed to the oxygen and no matter how much you think and how much you think you can keep what you think inside of you, when you breathe out you don&rsquo;t realize it went out with the carbon dioxide. For a brief moment there&rsquo;s a loss of storage and security for the very things you&rsquo;re thinking and their geometry and they go out through your nostrils as carbon dioxide. Now I have to breathe, I&rsquo;m next to you, I breathe in oxygen, is it truly oxygen or your carbon dioxide? Is it your loss of ideas that you kept so close inside of your brain that have now become my ideas and I call it mine? Even if we are in two different rooms and don&rsquo;t even see each other, &ldquo;Ah I got a wonderful inspiration&rdquo; is it really my inspiration or was it your inspiration? Do you see why we are so vulnerable that the other person&rsquo;s thought is not really theirs? Neither your own wonderful discovery of your inspiration is not really yours? It flows in the field constantly flushing and feeding the two forms but how we synchronize with the geometry in the different rates of the brain, we will utilize it and it becomes part of our inspiration and part of our memory bank. And yet there is no way we can put a lock and key here to keep it out from anybody because it will go back out in the exhalation and someone will pick it up and call it their inspiration. Now the fear of being affected by the negativeness will have to be set up by who? The person who is saying that they&rsquo;re being affected by a negative. So if you feel something negative is entering you and your feeling is coming from someone else and you&rsquo;re trying to insulate yourself, it is because the brain hasn&rsquo;t indexed correctly reality of this function that negative and discordance is within your own self that the other person really isn&rsquo;t doing anything. But because we are atomic in structure and energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared, that&rsquo;s the formula of validating the atomic mass. 1:10 And energy is what we are, life energy, and all mass is here as quanta and if this mass is moving at this velocity 186,000 miles a second squared&hellip; Let us not take the square, let&rsquo;s just take 186,000 miles a second, that&rsquo;s a fantastic velocity and we live on a little planet called Earth and it&rsquo;s approximately a little over eight thousand miles in diameter. Let&rsquo;s divide this eight thousand miles in diameter into 186,000 miles velocity, we may end up around 23-24 as an answer. Picture for one moment your thoughts leaving your brain via your nostrils as carbon dioxide bombarding Indra Devi in India 23 times a second, let alone it&rsquo;s going backwards to you. How can they handle being bombarded let alone shut out feedback of what we call positive and negative conditions of anybody. For this reason individuality is not a safety factor to hide behind. The unified field, the oneness of the Creative Consciousness as a Christ principle is the only insulator you have. This insulating principle itself modifies the effect of a negative feedback upon the organism. That&rsquo;s how come the ambassador says &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you&rdquo; and then he got the present back, without even realizing he got this card saying &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; This unifying principle is what insulates us. The atomic physics shows us that we can&rsquo;t really shut off everyone, we can only enhance the fear of our own structure to hurt ourselves by feeling we are losers when in actuality we are winners and the winning-ness is the Christ principle already in you. So if you have a grain of a mustard seed, you ever see the size of a mustard seed? If you have the conviction that you&rsquo;re this much a winner, faith in me like the size of a mustard seed, you see how the mountain moves? A mountain of thought patterns will move away with the conviction of the structure that you are a winner and if you ever have to go to school to get any kind of a degree from any university, you know losers don&rsquo;t get degrees and degrees or diplomas never say you&rsquo;ve got an A or a B or a C or a 100 or 99, it merely says you went through the process and you ended up with your diploma. So everyone that comes out with a degree are winners, enhancing it all the time, the thought process inside of you is the same. And it&rsquo;s only the fear and the biggest fear of going through an education to get a diploma is always &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make the test&rdquo; and yet every time when the test is over, you&rsquo;re laughing &ldquo;I made it! I made it! I made it!&rdquo; And then when the graduation day comes, the people who get the real praise is not you or the faculty, it is those people who&rsquo;ve been pushing you to keep on going and that&rsquo;s what you call educating (inaudible). The reality of thought and the ability to use its positiveness is locked up in you, not to turn down, that you&rsquo;re born as winners. This is your structure but if you keep enhancing the fact that you can&rsquo;t do it then the weakness will turn you down but if you realize how you&rsquo;re put together already, you&rsquo;re never turned down. Audience: I think we will take a five minute break. (Gap in tape). Adano: I&rsquo;ve been asked to explain the consciousness, why we go through these particular states. What you call consciousness originates at the sperm level in the struggle between the other sperms to be a winner to bond with the ovum. Now since a loser cannot be born and the winner is born, at that biological level you and I have pulled every trick in the book and it&rsquo;s classified as a pile of sins in your churchianistic terminology to be the winner. And therefore whatever we seem to do after we&rsquo;re born is a biological feedback taking precedence from the genetic level on our psychological mechanical nature. And therefore when you think you have negative thoughts or positive thoughts and don&rsquo;t know where they really originate, if we want to blame others that is only partly true. The full truth is that both of us carry within ourselves the memory bank of having pulled every trick of the book to fool the other sperms to go in the wrong direction so that you can (inaudible). You not only play king as winner but you play CIA as saboteur. You&rsquo;re (inaudible) but you were a democrat in the process of competition and when you won the race and bonded with the ovum, that was non-profit society, only two of you are existing as a people form. But until the cord is cut, you&rsquo;re not a human being yet, you&rsquo;re still a form. Though you may biologically pump, the respiratory action sets you apart from all the rest and from that moment on you have to be a functioning organism subjected to a playback of all these different subtle biological functions within us. So in whatever culture you find yourself and whatever tradition you may futuristically get involved with, their thought patterns are only basic biological survival mechanics that come up to take priority over their behavior in order to hold their position to survive. So if you and I may feel somebody is threatening you, it is their own psychological and biological fear of their survival that is rising up within them and trying to be abrasive or abusive. In essence everyone carries this memory process and sometimes it can be so dominating that you don&rsquo;t seem to be able to control it. But once you sense within your organism some weakness and wonder where the weakness is coming from, you can phase down the result of the weakness and enhance the sense of strength from your own organism because you have accomplished the fact as a winner. And in the process of becoming a winner, there were many times as an organism the sense of weakness, failure, occurred in the process but in the final summation it did not occur as long you were born. The final summation is that you did win. Equally true the other individuals who may seem to be threatened or abrasive in your environment are generating the same subtle fears in their lifestyle and it overrides on each other. But as long as you realize where it&rsquo;s coming from and it&rsquo;s setup to create immunity between organisms, not destruction between organisms. 1:20 That is why they &ldquo;The Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; This reinforces and insulates all the time. That&rsquo;s why Jesus would say &ldquo;None come unto the Father but by me.&rdquo; All these are reinforcements of the biological levels against our own interplay. So depressive moods, self-destructive moods, and we can bring them up, see all kinds of various ways to do it, let us realize one thing: at the biological level the sense of the self-destructiveness is present there. The fact that it doesn&rsquo;t take a geometrical shape, it is because it&rsquo;s not exposed to a combination of this bonding of the sperm and ovum to live a certain lifestyle in a traditional geometry of its environment. Until that occurs, we have a geometry to pass through the brain to relate to the feeling but nevertheless the feeling is valid of a destructive nature within us from journey to the bonding effect and if you ever say the picture Mission Impossible? When this tape is finished it will self-destruct? Don&rsquo;t feel for one moment that self-destruct in you is not valid, it is a valid condition placed there as a challenge to the winning-ness of the cell to achieve the accomplishment over that state. And since you didn&rsquo;t self-destruct, that means you didn&rsquo;t lose, you won, that is ingrained and is turned on within you as the continuity of immunity and the continuation of the genetics of you. So the good qualities of parental donating or giving has triumphed in you. Their Christ qualities triumph in you as the winner. Now you&rsquo;re going to run into a lot of other people who come from different traditional heritages who will have depressive feelings and fears and frustrations and self-dominance all going on in there too and you may feel that they are doing something in an under-handed, subtle way. They may or may not be doing, the question is the feeling is a universal bio-feedback process to challenge you to keep activating and reminding you of your Christ nature and not to sell yourselves short for having achieved it. Audience: The group of people that we were talking about that were involved in a negative situation and this situation is going on, when we finally realized what was happening, we all spent more than a week just sending love. We sent love in every shape, size, and color and for hours at a time in that whole direction. I guess we did it several weeks,we just sent love after we had woken up to what was going on. Adano: (Inaudible) a group or an individual thinking up negative behavior to another individual, it is only his own biological feedback of the fears ingrained in his traditional genetics to be a winner and had to pull every trick in the book against other sperms in his own matrix to be a winner but he may not realize that and he comes out programmed within certain structural forms of thinking that the only way he can get even is to act a certain way. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said &ldquo;Forgive them for they know not what they&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; Their biological structure is set with a self-destruct process. That&rsquo;s why there are only three trials that the human mechanism is subjected to all the time: food, self-destruction, and possession. There is no other trial here for you and I. Once you override them, you know that you&rsquo;re a winner and you will make it but if you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re a winner, you&rsquo;ll succumb to the food, you&rsquo;ll succumb to the self-destruction, and you&rsquo;ll succumb to the possession. Now we all know, rich man or poor man when they&rsquo;re sound asleep don&rsquo;t own a doggone thing and if they don&rsquo;t wake up, they still don&rsquo;t own anything. And both rich man and poor man can be self-destructive from the very fact it was locked into the cells before they became winners to be born. So if they act self-destructive and trying to generate it on others, it is that part of their nature that is triggering them to release. But again in terms of the food, we will often hurt others to be greedy for what we need to survive but when we realize we are winners and that everyone that is in this physical form is a winner, then we don&rsquo;t resort to the biological existence to survive, we set up the psychological regimentation to survive: a self-respect for each other, a certain evaluation of each other, a higher integrity quality locked in in each of us, the greater potential of creativity to be released out from us. This has to be fostered so that the apparent negative qualities that were present in the biological race is no longer necessary to fall back on to dominate with behavior but we don&rsquo;t know that until we wake up to our structure. That&rsquo;s why all the teachers are telling us &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re born again, you can&rsquo;t get to the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; Forget the kingdom of heaven out in the sky, the real kingdom of heaven in an actual practical day-to-day encounter is knowing how you&rsquo;re put together structurally at the spermal range and bringing it into the biological, psychological behavior of a moment the moment existence here in your environment. This is heaven on earth. Audience: Didn&rsquo;t Jesus say the kingdom of heaven is within you? Adano: Good, because you will understand now that you&rsquo;re born a winner and that you are the Christ principle in action therefore your own true nature will release creative ideas to provide all the rewards you want from the environment. But you have to go there to get this quality of consciousness, to know how it&rsquo;s put together and so not to be afraid and no matter what we feel others are thinking and doing, it&rsquo;s because they are carrying that in there (inaudible). But when we generate love, the mere idea that you said we are generating love against a negative self-destruct, this is exactly what you did biologically to decide to be the winner over deciding to be a loser. You had to love what? A sense of life over a sense of death. The love of life has to predominate at that biological level to win and so when it comes out now, that same sense of life, that same love of life has to be enhanced. So the man Jesus again pointing back by saying, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of the mind.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say half the mind and God being omnipresent, there&rsquo;s not a single place He can&rsquo;t be so He&rsquo;s got to be in hell too, think of that one. If He&rsquo;s omnipresent, He&rsquo;s got to in hell too, right? So what our labels are, are very very erroneous at times to what actually is going on. And to love Creative Intelligence with all your mind, there&rsquo;s not a part of your mind that is going to be commanded to be withdrawn, it has to be all. So all is omnipresent already and since you&rsquo;re born a winner, it&rsquo;s all Christ consciousness here.  Now, &ldquo;with all of your heart&rdquo; so it is to remind yourself how you&rsquo;re put together again. And &ldquo;with all of your strength,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s your breathing, you get your strength from breathing. If you don&rsquo;t breathe, you got no strength, you got no life. And &ldquo;with all of your Soul,&rdquo; that is the total consciousness of your integrity as a being. And &ldquo;love one another as yourself.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;like yourself,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a vast difference between &ldquo;like yourself&rdquo; or &ldquo;as yourself&rdquo; and as you generated love for those who may think they&rsquo;re generating negativeness to hurt or take advantage of, which originates from their own biological fears to become winners, that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re generating after birth state. See? Something that is locked in at the biological state is now emerging at the after birth state and (inaudible) taking it out and calling it criminal activities and all kind of abuse activities. They&rsquo;re all from that level to be confronted and be resolved. 1:30 Those who recognize their winning-ness and their total-ness generating this love begins to phase it down and many many tests are being made today and all around the world people are carrying on long hours of group meditation to phase down the violence of the biological structure. Since we&rsquo;re all biologically originated to become winners in a biological community and tend to act out psychologically some of these biological fears, we who have the attitude of love and generate it from the heart now, is doing more at a subtle level along with those who are in control to enforce certain regulations. We are making the transmutation on the environment and as I said at the speed of light. If you&rsquo;re bombarding a person 23 times in a minute, you can imagine the concentrated love felt and generated. We can start bombarding them. The result is that you phase down their feedback from their biological memory so their psychological behavior and their feelings of being put upon are pushed away&hellip;</p>
<p>Adano84_07_24FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3 - In the human temple the spine is that sacred place, the altar. It&rsquo;s a point of focus within your own body. As you watch, the important thing to do is not to analyze, just watch. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said &ldquo;When the eyes are single&rdquo; or when the eyes are focused internally, &ldquo;the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fact that you can validate for yourself, cells are made up of atoms. &ldquo;And the light is shining in the darkness.&rdquo; The atomic light of your cells are already illuminating the boundary lines of the cells which we call darkness. &ldquo;And the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; That is the boundary lines cannot analyze the light. &ldquo;But let your light so shine.&rdquo; That is keep watching it, it&rsquo;s already shining, you don&rsquo;t have to turn it on, it&rsquo;s already turned on in you, all you have to do is to watch. &ldquo;Let your light so shine before men.&rdquo; That is your friends around you, the world around you. &ldquo;That they may see the good works.&rdquo; That is the time you spent to look inside of your cellular structure so that the health which is life, which is radiance, which is viticity, which is synchronicity, which is divinity, which is immunity begins to permeate your body in the form of joyousness. That radiance can be seen externally in your body as evidence that you spent a great deal of time, or we say the good works, in keeping the body in a sense of focus or balance. It is very obvious, it is not something you can hide, it glows of its own accord. No one can give you the light, the light is already in you, another human being can only direct you to where it is. You have to master it yourself, you have to become unified with it, that&rsquo;s your option. It is like turning the key over to you to let you drive your own car. If you&rsquo;ve been a passenger all your life about where you are in your head, at this moment in time you&rsquo;re behind the wheel. Nobody can drive it for you, no one can watch for you inside of your head, you have to watch for yourself. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;God&rsquo;s witness&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah witness,&rdquo; consciousness is watching Its own unfoldement, Its own evolution, Its own realization. But if you analyze it, you put the brakes on it. If you watch, you have a beautiful journey waiting for you all you gotta do is steer the wheel. The more you watch inside, the more you live in the present, the &ldquo;all Now,&rdquo; the creative &ldquo;I Am.&rdquo; When you analyze you, drift between past and possible future. The past cannot come back to live again and the future can&rsquo;t be lived because you only live Now. (Short meditation). 0:13 I&rsquo;m very thankful to be back again. I remember the first time I came in this house, just three of us. Either the tree grew or the leaves multiplied. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see so many beautiful faces. For those who don&rsquo;t understand some of the words that they use like Satsang, let&rsquo;s clarify it. I know it&rsquo;s a very Oriental word and a lot of interpretations for it but when you get down into the actual mechanics of what it represents, it goes deeper than what is interpreted. Eastern people use the word &ldquo;Sat&rdquo; to mean existence and &ldquo;Sanga&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sang&rdquo; as fellowship and so they jumble the two things together and call it fellowship with truth and leave it there hanging in your consciousness. But it goes beyond philosophy, it goes beyond psychology, it goes down into the nitty-gritty of the atomic physics. Existence is already here. You are here. You&rsquo;re not wishing to be here, your atomic body is right here, all 144 elements that comprise the universe is in each one of us. We have to come to grips with it on a conscious level for our own conscious evolution and conscious transformation. That&rsquo;s why they call it fellowship, the involvement of your own actual existence. So it goes beyond mere philosophy and mere psychology because we&rsquo;re living now and we have aches and pains and needs and frustrations and doubts and if we can&rsquo;t confront those conditions at the actual level, we don&rsquo;t have anything to build on. So it has nothing to do with the belief anymore, it has to do with what you do with your own potential and how you come to grips with your potential and how you are structured out. It&rsquo;s taking a long time for modern Man to come to grips with his structure, though it had been pointed in that direction, &ldquo;Seek the truth, the truth which is within you, it will make you free, free men all, lord of yourself.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s left hanging in the air and periodically we have examples of individuals who exemplify this atomic physics that makes them stand out as unique people. And we pay a great deal of reverence and love to them yet when you get down to the nitty-gritty, how do you experience it? That&rsquo;s more important, how do you experience it. It&rsquo;s alright to hear somebody talk of it but if I&rsquo;m talking of apple pie it ain&rsquo;t going to satisfy your stomach if it&rsquo;s empty, you&rsquo;re got to put it inside your mouth and find out if there&rsquo;s too much cinnamon or too much sugar or it ain&rsquo;t cooked enough, right? And that&rsquo;s exactly what a Satsang is. A Satsang is a direct confrontation with your own physics. That&rsquo;s why the man Jesus said &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t talking of nebulous association, he&rsquo;s talking of actual, direct association with the body and people around you. And &ldquo;in my name,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a very very nebulous statement until you come to grips the actual physics of it. &ldquo;Name&rdquo; is a label and requires sonics to exemplify it. So if I ask you what is your name? You can&rsquo;t do like that with your hands, you&rsquo;ll have to say something or if you can&rsquo;t speak then you&rsquo;ll use sign language trying to indicate to me on a level of subtle sonics so I understand what your name is. So even the subtle sonics is involved let alone the audible sonics so &ldquo;gathering in my name,&rdquo; physically you&rsquo;re involved with two ranges of the sonics: the audible range and the inaudible range and you have to integrate it like hooking two cables and turning over the engine. 0:20 It&rsquo;s like your car stalled out there, ain&rsquo;t going no place, and you&rsquo;re trying to thumb a ride and somebody comes along and bump you with the jumper cable and you start up all over again, that&rsquo;s what Satsanga is. It&rsquo;s the same actual physics, the locking in of your physiology with the environmental sonics in reference to the life form that gave utterance to that sonics and would be responsible for that utterance. In other words, Eveready battery produced by Eveready will be backed up by Eveready, right? So we have something factual to work with, not nebulous or guessing anymore, the actual science can be experienced, integrated into your cellular structure, and that which you call holistic health or realization or Divine Quality begins to manifest. In modern technology we call it biological timing. God is that cosmic timing that appears to put everything in balance in your life and you walk and live in that timing. &ldquo;I live and move in His being.&rdquo; You live and move in biological timing. It makes more sense to you because now you can actually live it without fear or without guilt and it&rsquo;s not a nebulous non-entity, it&rsquo;s an actuality that begins to permeate you moment-to-moment. You can&rsquo;t seem to shake it off, it seems to pull you together for the first time and put your life in order. And it&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of because all the great teachers tell us, all you have to say to this invisible force &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid, where do I go from here?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like your own son come and tell you &ldquo;Dad I broke the car, what do I do next?&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay son, let&rsquo;s fix it.&rdquo; So the feeling of guilt and the remorse isn&rsquo;t necessary like years ago to prod us on to accept our reality. The conscious love of knowing ourselves is the real prod, that has to be generated from inside of us, a conscious love to know our structure, to relate with this love, and that&rsquo;s what the fellowship is. Why are you here? You&rsquo;re not here because of guilt, you&rsquo;re here because of a conscious love and a reaching out from the heart, a warmth, an exchange that builds health, that conscious love is what you want to incorporate moment-to-moment, let it take over and work on the cells. You&rsquo;ll only feel it as a form of tingling but don&rsquo;t discredit it, it&rsquo;s too fantastic. That tingling is an indication like the cable between the two batteries that something is passing but you can&rsquo;t hook up two batteries and don&rsquo;t turn on the engine, it will drain off one right? So you have to have one engine turned up and sending the charge to the other battery until the other battery is able to turn over its own engine and go. And that&rsquo;s basically the physics behind Satsang, an interconnectedness at the atomic physics. The car that comes along that is capable of giving you a boost to get you going, it&rsquo;s not a superior car, it&rsquo;s just that it happened to be there at the moment of your need. Hundreds of cars can pass, how many would stop? The one that stops is the one that gives you the boost, right? And that&rsquo;s exactly what we are to each other. When we relate or understand what&rsquo;s going on, we&rsquo;re all boosters to individuals who need the boost. So I&rsquo;m not greater than you nor are you lesser than me, as Jesus says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough that we be friends.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s more important, that we can give each other a cosmic booster charge to that inward love. It&rsquo;s really a charge of love more so than a personalized love where you localize it to your family. It&rsquo;s a love that takes in all life so it expands the heart more for you, you begin to see aspects of yourself in this love all around you. So when we come together in the term Sat-sang, we are really coming together at the atomic physics to give the cellular structure a booster charge of the inner love between creation and Creator. The car that gives you the boost is just as helpless if its engine isn&rsquo;t working and if its battery isn&rsquo;t working so you see there&rsquo;s a certain quality in one car over the other that is what is running and working and the other one is only stalled. So that&rsquo;s why the great man Jesus said &ldquo;Suffer it to be so for this is the way of righteousness&rdquo; or &ldquo;None come unto the Father but by me.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s atomically saying we really can&rsquo;t activate our own dead battery. (Laughter). &ldquo;Suffer it to be so,&rdquo; you gotta get up and reach out in need so that they will at least stop and give you a boost. For that reason it makes us more human and the suffering is not really a painful suffering, it is the fact that it makes you appreciate that you&rsquo;re not alone in the universe. The end result is still a high form of health, a health that transcends the normal healing of conditions of the body. It&rsquo;s a type of health that raises your level of immunity and it gives you a different kind of peace that we are all seeming to look for but don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re really looking for. Jesus said &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; The world gives you six feet under the ground and &ldquo;may you rest in peace.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a form of sedation because it&rsquo;s total withdrawal from the source of life or the flow of life and realize people can&rsquo;t offer you that. As long as they&rsquo;re in their bodies, it would be highly impractical to offer a person that. That&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;My God is a God of the living and not of the dead.&rdquo; They can only offer you the strength of peace not the peace of peace, that&rsquo;s a different kind of peace. 0:30 They offer you another boost to your own battery to get up and go again, to cope with life. Just as much as that car will drive off and leave you with your car turning over to go out and do your business, right? But they wouldn&rsquo;t go away until you&rsquo;re able to turn over your own engine and move right? And that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about, that kind of inward connectedness. And so fellowship with truth is a kind of interconnectedness that is going on between all life forms to help us to realize that there is a deep concern in life itself, the Creative Intelligence itself. That deep concern is love for It to continue to be and if it was not there, we&rsquo;d just phase off and we&rsquo;d all go our own way to fade out but somewhere in the whole process, this deep concern comes in and pulls us together. Earlier I said that most of us can be a passenger in the car and never get behind the wheel and when we do get behind the wheel, it doesn&rsquo;t say if we know how to drive. That&rsquo;s a part also that needs to be cleared up in the human being, where they&rsquo;re going. We come into this world like passengers, everything is done for us, and we have a craving to be responsible, that means we would like to learn to drive the car, we would like to learn to be responsible for this mechanism, take care of it after many bumps. But if we don&rsquo;t learn how to drive it, we can&rsquo;t be trusted with the key, we&rsquo;re gonna create a lot of accidents. So learning to drive the car is nature&rsquo;s way to educate us through pain, she doesn&rsquo;t have any any other way to teacher us. Even when you go to learn to drive a car, the chances are you may bump the fender, back into something, turn hard and scratch up a lot of things till you get the feel of the vehicle, then you&rsquo;re competent behind the wheel. That&rsquo;s the same way with consciousness, trying to relate to the Creative Intelligence. We have to go through frustrations, a lot of disappointments, and finally we get a sense of focus that we can stick it out. Somehow this strength of sticking it out seems to develop in us or emerging in us and the first time we say something to ourselves and go through the motions of making it work and sticking it out until it is all complete, this strength appears for the first time. It&rsquo;s a form of healing to the mechanism. You&rsquo;re turning on your immunity consciously for the first time. Well you may not know that because no one comes along to tell you about it and you couldn&rsquo;t be ready for the explanation because you&rsquo;d be too busy trying to pursue your own desires. You have to live a certain amount of years and then go through an inward evaluation to come to that type of readiness. This is why Eastern people say &ldquo;When the student is ready, the Master will be there.&rdquo; Years ago when Yogananda was alive I wrote him a letter and I asked him &ldquo;Sir, what constitutes readiness in a student?&rdquo; And he wrote on back on a piece of paper, not an inch of the paper was empty, one word he wrote all over the whole page back and front and the word was &ldquo;frustration.&rdquo; When you&rsquo;re totally frustrated, then you&rsquo;re ready for a Master. Not a Master but for master-hood, that means your sense of questioning is suspended for the first moment and the sense of listening to yourself begins to increase. And so he directed me back to look inside of my own head and don&rsquo;t try to analyze, quit the analysis. Not that the analysis is bad or you&rsquo;re not going to use it but for the time being it would be like the guy who is stalled, along comes the other one, and he&rsquo;s busy arguing how to hook it up between the two vehicles, analyzing the cables. So that&rsquo;s exactly the same situation as it goes on. Then I slowed down my brain and just watched inside and began to listen instead of trying to analyze what was going in my biological structure. The internal embodiment of Spirit, which is the Creative Life, began to emerge through the cells. The atomic physics began to open up and I realized we don&rsquo;t have the comprehension by analyzing it, we get the comprehension by living it. We have to go through the conflicts that come up day by day and work it out through our emotional levels, our intellectual levels, and our physical levels then the comprehension begins to emerge. Paul will call that &ldquo;the fruit of the Spirit,&rdquo; understanding. Yet the gifts of the Spirit came and those are the ability to read the mind and psychic phenomenon and so forth. They&rsquo;re all part of your nature, don&rsquo;t discredit them or don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re to be overly emphasized, they&rsquo;re what you call a by-product. The most important thing is the understanding of what it&rsquo;s doing for you. Everyone is entitled to the gifts of the Spirit but it takes a long time to extract what I call &ldquo;the oil of the nut.&rdquo; Your head is a big nut with a lot of ideas in there (laughter) but to extract that understanding, you&rsquo;ve got to go through a lot of internal conflicts first. It&rsquo;s easy to get the gifts to come up to work for you, some people take a little longer but they work. Understanding is far more a deeper growth and that takes time. 0:40 In the understanding the real health emerges for the first time and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so unique about it, that within this very structure the physics of cellular transformation and transmutation and non-decomposition, like a butterfly existing in a caterpillar. It&rsquo;s not a figment of your imagination, it happens in the caterpillar so you and I carry it, we can delay the process but we can&rsquo;t prevent it from happening. Each one of us carries that in the mechanism, it&rsquo;s the Creative Principle, this is Its embodiment in us and &ldquo;To him that overcome I will not send forth a second time&rdquo; is the challenge, the real testing of ourselves. And He tests us in the most difficult thing that we cherish, that&rsquo;s our health. Possessions can come and go, loved ones can come and go, but health, when it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone. That&rsquo;s the most challenging test in terms of your mechanism but if you take the words of the great Teachers and they are committed to their words, I&rsquo;m only reminding you that the battery manufacturer is committed to his product so you have something to fall back on. &ldquo;If you lose your life for my sake, you will have it back.&rdquo; Big brother Jesus said that you know so you can hold him to the warranty. (Laughter). It&rsquo;s very true because he will be behind his words, he won&rsquo;t let you down. All great Teachers are behind their words because that&rsquo;s their whole role in life, it is God in them that makes the statement really when they have realized their God-ness. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;As many as received him, to them gave he the power to become the sons of God.&rdquo; Even those that believe in his name. You have that guarantee locked up in you and it&rsquo;s declared by the living body so it&rsquo;s imprinted in the cosmic atoms, it can&rsquo;t go away. It&rsquo;s just that it takes us time to wake up to it and wake up to what we have waiting for us and I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s an overnight process, I wouldn&rsquo;t promise you that. Each one of us is working through his own particular time lapse, the Eastern men call that &ldquo;the scope of the horror,&rdquo; the horoscope. (Laughter). So three wise men went to see Jesus you know, they were astrologers and kings at the same time so that&rsquo;s basically where we all come in, at different periods of time with our own particular karmic indebtedness to work out and that&rsquo;s our invoice commitment. In other words each one of us, the lifestyle is your own blueprint and you have to work through that blueprint to your Divinity. The Sagittarian has his to work out, the Scorpio has his to work out, the Taurus has his to work out it. Whatever it is, but out of the basic 12 blueprints, each one works out his own Divinity. So you begin to realize that everyone around us is unique because they&rsquo;re all working out their own destiny through that particular blueprint that they have to work out. When we drive in the car and we wish to get behind the wheel, we have three conditions: learning to drive first so you can be a responsible individual behind the wheel. And after we know how to drive, we can go to work and earn the money to buy the car and then we can walk up to the salesman and make the arrangements for the responsibility of the car in your name, get the key and get behind the wheel and pick up the map and go down the road, that&rsquo;s exactly the same with our own creative structure. Driving the car or learning to drive the car is recognizing the ups and downs with the frustrations in your life and the salesman who has the key is the teacher who will give it to you when you&rsquo;re frustrated. And what he&rsquo;s giving you primarily what they call initiation or introduction to the inward light and the sense of direction of how to focus itself (gap in tape) &hellip;so the joy of driving is the unfoldment and this unfoldment is not an overnight process, it is moment-to-moment and you know when you drive a car you have to have gas in the tank otherwise it&rsquo;s not going any place if it&rsquo;s empty. Equally true this bodily car isn&rsquo;t going to go any place if you don&rsquo;t breathe, the nostril is the tank and the Creator is the gasoline and as long as you have gasoline to keep the tank going, you can drive a long way through the universe. So the whole universe is awaiting consciousness. Not too long ago I see they did some research and the research is that we can travel in time, time travel, they&rsquo;re proving more and more that we can transcend the limitations of the five senses and the limitations of what we call concave vision, that is vision where you look AT and convex vision is where you look through. Some of us have the capacity to see through quicker than others. That doesn&rsquo;t say that no one doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity, everyone has the capacity to see through to the atomic source but not all of us are ready to see through. The frustrations and the aggravations and the sense of timing limits that capacity to see through to the atomic structure and as soon as we clean up the body, the sense of timing comes back, the frustrations are reduced, and consciousness begins to see through, matter becomes transparent so they say you&rsquo;re clairvoyant. There are techniques or exercises to develop it too but it&rsquo;s already part of our natural process. 0:50 The more we study the structure and its laws and dynamics, the more we realize that God realization or transformation of the consciousness over the body is an actuality and it&rsquo;s not a nebulous process, it&rsquo;s very very factual and very practical. The Eastern approach began with a simple method by looking inwards through closing the eyes and derive certain actual experiences and transformations and over the centuries we&rsquo;ve come this far into today&rsquo;s society where evidence of that internal knowledge can be measured by equipment. So in combining both, we have made a greater jump in shortening the time and more people can experience their own internal reality. The getting together in silence in a group is valid and in your own home in private also is valid and the process has nothing to do with any actual location. Years ago the temples or ashrams were considered a place to go to pursue the process. What we&rsquo;ve come to realize is that those places were used as a means to act as a form of therapy or clinic for many who couldn&rsquo;t function rationally in their environment and had to go to these areas to be instructed how to look to their own internal mechanism for their health again and with the advent of modern science, we&rsquo;ve come a long way to where we can actually validate many of the experiences and it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with being away from society anymore. In the home with the family, with your friends, the ongoing process is the greatest discovery because you&rsquo;re living in the Now and you can bring this particular inward experience to the surface quick because you can evaluate the results and realize that the results are practical and they are measurable and they have an uplifting value not only for yourself but for others. That&rsquo;s why when the man Jesus said, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; He was the first one to give the group association its first boost over the individual personal practice. That doesn&rsquo;t say the individual personal practice is not necessary, it is necessary, we need both. We need to be by ourselves at times and we need to relate with others, it&rsquo;s just sort of an overflow, it balances us. You can be too withdrawn and they&rsquo;ll call you an introvert, you can be too outward and they can call an extrovert but if you have the balance, you can function properly and that&rsquo;s more healthy to have the balance between the inward and the outward, to use both. Your own discoveries are your own personal evidence that each one of us is unique and there is no room for feeling left out because your horoscope is not his horoscope or her horoscope. So you can&rsquo;t go at their speed, you&rsquo;ve got to go at your own speed in the unfoldment. The Eastern people used to call it karma, now we can narrow it down to the actual invoice of the life form when it came in into this manifestation to live out the interplay of the polarity of the body. Somebody once asked me if a horoscope is detrimental information because a lot of things concerning it always show up that you&rsquo;re going to have this bad and this condition waiting for you and I said as far as I know from horoscopes, all horoscopes are break even. It&rsquo;s half and half but the funny part of a horoscope is that there&rsquo;s no sequential cancellation, it&rsquo;s random cancellation but they cancel each other out. In other words if you had one to a hundred and divide it in half and it would be fifty/fifty and you were to write one to fifty and then from 50 to 100, there&rsquo;ll be sequential cancellation right? So one will match 50, 2 will match 51, see what I mean? That would be a sequential cancellation because it would be opposite to cancel each other out but not so in a horoscope. A horoscope is a random cancellation of an equal function. So 1 may cancel 98, 2 may cancel 65, get what I mean? And 3 may cancel 70 so because they&rsquo;re so random, they come up to test you only for one reason, that you develop immunity. 1:00 Now immunity at its highest level of refinement is your divinity. If you were to say a person is Divine, you can be carried away into a nebulous range of trying to define that person&rsquo;s quality but if that person was to be practical about their divinity, you will see that they are capable of withstanding all conditions and they have a very high immunity. The more spiritual we become, the more immune to the breakdown of the mechanism you become, see that&rsquo;s the more Divine. The closer you get to God, the less all the problems are going to bother you, right? Now, then we want to know what is spirituality, can we find a functional description of it so that we can live with it and not feel left out or holier than thou? We find that spirituality is the practicality. The more spiritual you become, the more practical you become and less impractical. Spirituality is not being overly religious, overly religious can be fanatical. A spiritual person is not overly religious, they&rsquo;re very very practical, you may not even recognize that they&rsquo;re spiritual and a religious person can be very impractical too, pretending they are religious and be very impractical and fanatical about their religiosity. But when you get to the real spiritual being who moves with the Spirit, that person is very very practical. So we have to clarify in our thinking the difference between being spiritual and being religiously involved and working towards a Divine realization, what that also involves. Sometimes we can go away with the belief that we&rsquo;re holier than others and trying to be more holier than others when in actuality that&rsquo;s not what really is going on inside of us. The more you become practical in your approach to life, the more the Spirit is taking over, the more the unification of nature is taking over and as you raise that spirituality more and more, the sense of guilt leaves you and the sense of weakness leaves you and the sense of strength and immunity begins to increase. So the ability to cope with a challenge as it presents itself moment to moment is evidence of your divinity unfolding. Instead of panicking or feeling lost and in a quandary, you begin to see this internal quality emerging for the first time. Then wherever you are, your mere presence is vitalistic to the environment, very nourishing to the environment, it is like the person who stopped to give you a jump in your car and let you go your way, you become like that. Your own mechanism, your own self-worth flows as evidence. Thank you. (Gap in tape). Okay if you have any questions you want to ask, I&rsquo;d be glad to answer to answer them, then we&rsquo;ll have another little meditation. So are there&rsquo;s any questions you want to ask? Audience: Could you describe what happens with cellular changes, what actually goes through the body and happens? Adano: So the first thing that happens is the respiration begins to change, it&rsquo;s evidence that you&rsquo;re having a physical change going on in the body, the breathing slows down. Now in some people when the breathing slows down, if they&rsquo;re too toxic it will refrigerate them and therefore the toxicity will stay longer in the body. If they&rsquo;re less toxic, then they don&rsquo;t have that problem. That&rsquo;s why the requirements in the ancient days were to clean up the body, they made the student clean the body and focus on the inward observation of the atomic process. Hence the statement &ldquo;Cleanliness is next to Godliness.&rdquo; Today we find that the emphasis on that cleanliness is valid in the early stages of your development because your own bodily toxins are going to come up and interfere with your focusing. Now before you even became conscious of this process or got involved in it, you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone looking for it if there wasn&rsquo;t some degree of toxicity already developing in your body either physical, psychological, emotional, or spiritual, there&rsquo;s a certain degree of toxicity increasing. Then you come to a point where you know that you must do something to correct it and as soon as you get exposed to the meditative process, the emphasis again is on cleaning the body up. The body will refrigerate itself and retain acids and it has to be cleaned out. Now as you continue to practice the internal observation, the quantity of carbon dioxide is gradually released quicker. Now life is oxygen, death is carbon dioxide. Oxygen is the only gas that produces the phenomenon called consciousness so you go back to the early writings, they say &ldquo;God breathed into Man breath of life and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; From the actual operation of the body, dead people don&rsquo;t utilize oxygen, they&rsquo;re loaded up with carbon dioxide. Now if you cut the umbilical cord from the baby, it has to have oxygen to live. The dilation and the constriction is the evidence of the apparent condition called consciousness. Under the microscope before the cord is cut, the baby is not breathing through the nostrils. There&rsquo;s a flap right over here and fluids are passing in and out but not through the nostrils, the lungs do not utilize oxygen. Now when the baby comes out and the cord is still connected, you can weigh that baby and then when the cord is cut and it does breathe on its own and you weigh that baby again, you&rsquo;ll find now the baby weighs three and a half ounces more. Now before a person is dying you can weigh them, the moment they stop breathing and weigh them again, they&rsquo;re three and a half ounces less. That oxygen plays a very important process in the dilation and constriction and it&rsquo;s also responsible as a pressure to move the fluid in the structure and responsible for the transportation of the minerals from the storage area to the point of demand which you call the chemistry. Now if the point of demand doesn&rsquo;t receive those minerals on time, we have an imbalance and if it doesn&rsquo;t hold when the cord is cut and the air is pressured into it and it doesn&rsquo;t hold, the body will phase out and then we have to bury it, it&rsquo;s refusing to hold. Now when we measure the pressure and the delivery, we only end up with two conditions: too much or too little then the healthy body is the correct amount on time. A sick body is too much or too little out of time delivery. Diseases then fall under two categories: hyper, that&rsquo;s mean diseases that are going too fast, the pressure is too fast. Or hypo, the pressure is too slow. Now if it goes on time, you don&rsquo;t have a diseased body, you have a healthy body but it&rsquo;s a timed body like that car out there, timed to run, and if it&rsquo;s not timed it&rsquo;ll stay there until you time it and that means the gas is going too fast through the carburetor or going too slow through the carburetor, right or wrong? Are you familiar? Good. So what you call health in the actual sense, what you call God-realization in the actual sense of the word where you have to come to grips with your mechanism and live with it moment-to-moment, is cellular timing. Now don&rsquo;t get carried away that the word cellular is materialistic and that it is something mundane. It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s the total creative process held together by this Cosmic Process. We are God manifested. We have arrived, we exist, we ain&rsquo;t trying to exist, it is that we don&rsquo;t accept our existence, we don&rsquo;t accept our God-ness in us yet, we don&rsquo;t know how to accept it because we don&rsquo;t know what direction to go to accept it. We have a lot of information pointed in the direction of how to recognize it, but some of that information from the way it was handed down tends to be partly factual and partly nebulous, there was no way to validate. Today we can validate that information. The nebulous part created a condition for guilt, it created a condition for limitation of the organism and irresponsibility. Today that nebulousness is removed with actual confrontation, actual experience, and no guilt. Responsibility is responsibility, confrontation is confrontation, and the reality is that you can measure the experience and the measurement is classified as truth or fact. So &ldquo;Seek the truth&rdquo; or seek the fact &ldquo;which is within you&rdquo; which is how your structure is put together and &ldquo;its righteousness&rdquo; which means its right operation between input to output, between constriction and dilation, and &ldquo;it will free you.&rdquo; That means it removes the guilt and the nebulousness and the presuppositions and the fears, the anxieties, and the panic and the sense of helplessness from the mechanism. &ldquo;Free men all.&rdquo; This freedom is a strength for the first time that you can cope with your confrontation, you have a sense of immunity building up to allow you to cope with it on a rational level without fear and &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; means &ldquo;control of.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re in control, you&rsquo;re in balance, you&rsquo;re not hyper or hypo, you have a rational homeostasis, a balance, you&rsquo;re having an inner peace, an inner strength over the cellular structure. The meditation is a means to recognize, together with the research that is going on in our lab, that we&rsquo;re on the threshold of the most fantastic conscious transformation of the human being from his lack of understanding to his reservoir of understanding and that reservoir gives him a sense of freedom and establishes his divinity without doubt and his spirituality without impracticalness or fanatic behavior. 1:20 So the gas oxygen is very important to understand because we have to breathe it. Now we bring in oxygen, what do we breathe out? Carbon dioxide, so carbon dioxide at one level of our mechanism can be toxic if it stays in too long, it can refrigerate us and freeze up the mechanism, clog it up. Yet at another level of acceleration, it establishes Divinity. The very same thing that will kill you will preserve you. The non-decaying body of the Saints or Mystics is evidence of the regulated carbon dioxide and oxygen. Just as much as the refrigerator will preserve meat from rotting by cooling it down, equally true this mechanism is designed to cool down and refrigerate and sustain an internal process of ongoing life without decomposition. More and more the researchers are showing that we carry an unusual process locked up in us and the Creative Intelligence is not out in the sky because somebody once says &ldquo;Adano, you say God is everywhere&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and then they looked at me and said &ldquo;Well if that is so, He&rsquo;s got to be in hell.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yes, He&rsquo;s His own hell.&rdquo; How can God be not in His own hell or heaven? So Omar Khayyam came out and said &ldquo;I sent the Soul out into this invisible,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the space between the two hands that can&rsquo;t see nothing, &ldquo;a letter&rdquo; or some kind of information &ldquo;of the afterlife&rdquo; that means what happened when we die, &ldquo;to spell and by and by the Soul came back and said &lsquo;I myself am heaven and hell&rsquo;.&rdquo; But let us look at it more objectively apart from the poetry, apart from the philosophy. We can see something more dynamic about it that is factual about it, far more within the range of experience that raises our quality. &ldquo;I&rdquo; this internal sonics. &ldquo;My-cell,&rdquo; how many you got that makes up your skin, millions right? &ldquo;Is a haven&rdquo; or a heaven, why is a heaven? Is it the storage place? What are we going to go to heaven to do, be indexed, cataloged? Nobody ever asked themselves the question, was is a heaven? It&rsquo;s a storage place, what kind of place would it be? So we&rsquo;re saying to ourselves, it&rsquo;s a haven or a heaven, it&rsquo;s a place where everything will be in order, so it&rsquo;s an actual storage. And a hell would be what? Something we have already prescribed to be a burning place when we actually can see the word is really &ldquo;a haven,&rdquo; a reservoir and &ldquo;a hell&rdquo; is where you&rsquo;re fixed or held. To be in a factual sense of the physics, &ldquo;I&rdquo; the sonics (Adano claps) is its own haven (Adano flaps his fingers together) and held. It&rsquo;s locked up here, the clapping of two hands and the flapping of one hand is still sonics, it ain&rsquo;t going any place. Never went anyplace, it&rsquo;s always here in the physics but we never experienced it or realized it that we are the crystallized sonics. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; in the very onset (Adano claps) was sound but by the same token heat is coming out of that impact. Now if the eyes were fixed and not moving, you would start to see a blue glow around the skin, the amount of temperature generated by the impact of the two palms against each other. You may call it an aura for lack of understanding the physics behind it since that was the name they gave it centuries ago. Today we know we don&rsquo;t have aura but we do have bio-thermal radiation by the internal chemistry at different parts of the anatomy slowed down by the carbon dioxide by stress, by trauma, that clothes. So different areas will appear to have different colors of the spectrum and yet if you were to go and measure those areas, their temperature will vary. In a healthy area it has one temperature, it has one particular color of the spectrum. In an unhealthy area you have a different temperature and another color of the spectrum and when we come into Solar Nutrition, we&rsquo;ll talk about the biological clock of the human body in reference to all kind of parts of the anatomy and you&rsquo;ll see how they all interrelate that you are your own heaven and hell. The chemistry is already set and so far the 144 elements are there, they&rsquo;re 12 basic in a large quantity, four gases in a large quantity and rest are in minute trace quantities but essential, none can be missing, they all have to be there to hold us together, we are a miniature universe. When it was written and spoken in philosophic language it was propagated like that as a belief system. Today we can&rsquo;t take it to the belief system, we have to confront it as a living dynamics of what actually is going on in us: who we are, what we are, why we are. &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;come let me,&rdquo; &ldquo;come let us,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s plural, right? And then &ldquo;image and likeness,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s dual, not singular. We look around in physics today, we don&rsquo;t see any singular force. Every force that we can encounter has a polaristic movement, even this electricity in here is polaristic. We are a polaristic organism, if we doubt it I never saw one ovum made a human being or one sperm make a human being, it takes two right or wrong? And you can&rsquo;t have used ovums so everybody&rsquo;s a virgin (laughter), that&rsquo;s a fact and losers can&rsquo;t be born, that&rsquo;s another fact, only winners are born. So everybody here has arrived in their cosmic existence. You can make yourself loser all your life by talking yourself into a nebulous state and the fears and the doubts and the worries but if you look at your structure and understand it for what it is and it&rsquo;s not a mundane thing. It&rsquo;s not no materialism, this is Cosmic laws that put us together, this Creative Intelligence wants to be embodied in every form that&rsquo;s why He&rsquo;s everywhere, He is everything but we don&rsquo;t understand it because we have a sense of separateness and that&rsquo;s the stumbling block, the sense of separateness. The sense of separateness exists only when the eyes are open, it diminishes when the eyes are closed and if ever the oxygen refuses to come in when the eyes are closed, you will know for sure that your sense of separateness it will not cease, you&rsquo;re totally unified. So when you go to sleep tonight you don&rsquo;t have no guarantee you&rsquo;re going to wake up tomorrow because you&rsquo;re breathing oxygen right now, you don&rsquo;t have no reserve oxygen waiting for you and when you&rsquo;re sound asleep, do you know if you&rsquo;re a man or a woman? This is facts now, right? If you dream then you&rsquo;re looking at something that is totally not catalogued properly in your brain and whatever you make up of the dream or label in the dream, you can be totally erroneous as to its true origin or why it&rsquo;s caused to be there. Yet the chemistry will go on working, the oxygen will come in, the carbon dioxide will stay and go out. Now, early researchers observed this phenomenon of respiration, oxygen/carbon dioxide and began to find ways and means to regulate this oxygenation and in the regulation of the oxygenation, they discovered that it moves certain minerals to react in the mechanism to give it certain levels of behavior or response and how that organism is programmed, these minerals will move to set up certain reactions. Today we are finding out that the crazy man isn&rsquo;t really crazy, there are certain imbalances in this chemistry but where the imbalances are coming from, all that has been concluded so far is the person is hyper or hypo which only tells us what that mineral is doing: it&rsquo;s either going too fast or too slow in the organisms. Now when you take that individual and allow him to slow his brain down by meditation and meditation is a very generalized word until you get into the nitty-gritty of it, it means lot more than what you think, the brain begins to regulate the breathing. Because when you look in here, close your eyes, a sense of separateness begins to diminish. In the early stages of closing your eyes, the sense of separateness is an anguish but because it&rsquo;s closely aligned with sleep&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1984-july-25---flagstaff-satsang">1984 July 25 - Flagstaff Satsang</h2>
<p>Adano84_07_25FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3NW9 - &hellip;the sense of unity increases when you start closing your eyes longer and longer and in sleep it&rsquo;s obvious, in death it&rsquo;s factual. Now there must be a link between sleep and death and realization. Realization is to be conscious, sleep is to be partially conscious and partially unconscious. Death, you&rsquo;re totally unconscious. All your wise men bring us back to this law of physics, especially the fellow by the name of Paul who said in his writings, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; It can be very nebulous but if you pin down the physics of that statement, you&rsquo;ll see talking strictly of oxygenation of the body and the enhancement of oxygenation within the range of reducing it and enhancing it. Dying is no oxygenation going on and living is oxygenation going on and he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;periodically,&rdquo; he said daily, that means it was a constant encounter with himself, he was actually experiencing this phenomenon. Now many of us have had the experience of being outside of the body but we get fooled when we think we&rsquo;re outside of the body because it&rsquo;s this very oxygen that produces the phenomena of consciousness that came into your body, allows you to breathe to be conscious, and to suddenly have a sense of &ldquo;I-ness,&rdquo; did not disengage the sense of &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo; when it went out in the form of carbon dioxide. So the sense of &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo; remained with the cells and a sense of separateness stayed with the carbon dioxide going out. When a jar to the body or a blow to the body or a traumatic incident or a switching down of the brain wave, the sense of &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo; can continue to remain with the gas oxygen that comes in and goes out and then you may say to yourself &ldquo;Did I really come in my body? Did I really come from any place? Who am I?&rdquo; Audience: Can our spirit be affected by human things like what we eat or emotions? Our Soul? Adano: The labels we place upon ourselves as to how we&rsquo;re structured out has created a great error in our experience therefore we don&rsquo;t experience. Number one: fact, do you have a Soul, yes or no? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Then be my guest, you&rsquo;re entitled to your frustration but I&rsquo;ll quote again the structure of the universal principle of how you&rsquo;re put together and that will make you realize if you have or you don&rsquo;t have Soul. &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness, male and female created them.&rdquo; &ldquo;God breathed breath of life into Man and Man became a living donkey.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Man became living Soul?&rdquo; Which is the correct statement? Man became living Soul. If he has a Soul, he will need his body to save it. Can your body save your Soul or will Soul transform the body? Now looking at the actual physics, &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness, male and female created them.&rdquo; This is manifestation, out of my voice a solid mass of the atoms is crystallizing in a plus/minus process known as male/female and appears as tissue, that&rsquo;s factual about all of us and breath of life has to enter that manifested tissue form to trigger it into activity. So that function is locked up in the breath of life which you call oxygen that produces this phenomena called consciousness, the ability to discern. We see that only when you&rsquo;re alive not when you&rsquo;re dead and the reference to God is for the living not of the dead. Even the man Jesus said &ldquo;My God is not of the dead but of the living&rdquo; which tells you right away Creative Intelligence is a life principle, not a non-life principle. If it&rsquo;s a life principle, it&rsquo;s involved in vitality. If it is involved in vitality, it&rsquo;s involved with dilation and constriction of a mass that produces the phenomena called awareness and this particular mass would have to have some pressurization, which would be a gas. The physical form of a child doesn&rsquo;t breathe through its lungs while it&rsquo;s in the womb, it&rsquo;s pressurized by the umbilical cord through the liquid going in and out of the mechanism and when that cord is cut, that pressurization from the mother is over and if it doesn&rsquo;t get its own pressurization from the environmental field to function, it will decompose right in front of your eyes. So you&rsquo;re looking at what your structure is and then you can&rsquo;t fool yourself no more and tell yourself you have a Soul. You are Soul from the fact that you are pressurized by the Cosmic Principle to come alive and take responsibility to move this mechanism into reality by transforming it by daily confrontation with it. So illness is a challenge to the immunity locked up in it, inadequacy is a challenge to practicality which is the spirituality locked up in it. So when you face yourself moment-to-moment, your needs are constantly manifesting for you but if you don&rsquo;t face yourself you&rsquo;ll go into deep levels of remorse and depression and then the body will start getting sick, getting weak. Yet somehow, no matter how depressed and how weak you are, way back in that brain of yours there&rsquo;s a little gnawing sensation that you are selling yourself short. 0:10 You know it, I know it but you may not feel you&rsquo;ve got the strength to make it change. Then you can panic and do one of two things, end your life or pray for it to change. Those who end their life sold themselves short, that means they sold the cell itself short of its potential but those who pray are tapping for the first time the core of the cell, the sonics locked up in it. Prayer is not &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; so much. It is the fact that you emphasize with the sonics &ldquo;I must break this pattern&rdquo; and the more you emphasize it, the more oxygen comes in and the more consciousness comes in, the more the dynamism of what you call Soul takes over and Soul saves the cell from its own desperation of self-destructiveness. Then you can get up and walk and be your own person. Thank you. Audience: Thank you Adano. (Gap in tape). Adano: It is like a recharge of a battery but you have to get that battery to work again when you turn the engine up. So the more important piece is not inside of meditation, it&rsquo;s outside of meditation when your eyes open in the active world. There the peace is different. How you cope with life, that type of peace is what we&rsquo;re talking about. It&rsquo;s not a withdrawal from society, it&rsquo;s a moment-to-moment living in the world. It&rsquo;s a form of therapy that heals the body, it&rsquo;s an ongoing healing process, it&rsquo;s a matter of turning it on so that the body heals itself. When Jesus told the physician &ldquo;Physician heal yourself,&rdquo; he was telling him to turn on his own self-awareness as to his own internal properties and allow this process to work. So when you come out of meditation, the important thing is to function in the environment in a state of peace, that&rsquo;s a form of cellular balance that you can function and cope with your environment. Last night we spoke about how you function with yourself and we didn&rsquo;t have much time to ask questions and so I think tonight I&rsquo;m gonna give you all the opportunities to ask your questions and in that way a lot of us can identify with internal experiences or conditions that are going on in their meditative life. Many of the answers can be answered through your questions. So if you have any questions you want to ask, just go ahead and ask. Audience: Are there any guide posts we can look for to observing changes in ourselves? Adano: Yes, the first indication that your body is transforming is your ability to resist cuts. When you cut yourself how fast the body heals back itself; and how you don&rsquo;t get exhausted from an encounter with another person. These are actual evidence that your body is becoming transformed. You begin to heal quicker, you don&rsquo;t get depressed so fast, you don&rsquo;t get exhausted in their presence, and a sense of timing takes over. You always seem to be at the right place at the right time for an incident to occur in your life, that&rsquo;s the evidence of Divine Will or Universal Will. Universal Will is environmental timing in the environment and inside of your body, everything must work on time. If ever there is an organized universe, this one is but at the same time it&rsquo;s set up to confront you by random confrontations lest you don&rsquo;t get into a rut and therefore the evidence that you see in your daily experiences come up as you start meditating, things will start to fall in place. But the conditions that come up for you to face, you cannot plot them or organize them, they come to you in a random situation to test your ability to react. It&rsquo;s like a boxer, every moment you are on the firing line. So the more you meditate, the more you quit living in the past and quit living in the future and start living in the Now because the past cannot solve the Now process, it will only enhance anguish. And gradually as the past phases out from aggravating you, your strength of confidence which you call Divine Love begins to permeate you, it&rsquo;s called the Christ Love or the Christ Peace. Then future conditions start to phase out, they don&rsquo;t set up anxiety, you start living Now more and more and eventually in that Now state, whatever you say with your voice begins to be an actuality in the atomic field because you are the embodiment of the Creative Process but you have to come to grips with it and the initiation is putting you in control by giving you the key to the car and turning you loose with the Master power. Now I cannot drive the car for you, I can carry you along like a passenger until you decide that you want to drive the car, that&rsquo;s prior to initiation. Initiation is to give you the key to turn on your own Master power to move, to draw your own inward consciousness. 0:20 Man is Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t have Soul. His body can&rsquo;t save Soul, that&rsquo;s an erroneous concept. But Soul will save the body from its mistakes and the mistakes are primarily trying to hang on the past or creating future when body and mind all are functioning now. So the Soul nature holds the focus in &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; they give you the strength to live and function in the now time. Then then the wholeness of your life, the health of your life, the prosperity of your life, it all starts pulling together. But it takes time too because too much identification with the past, too much craving for the future separates and interferes within &ldquo;Now time.&rdquo; The evidence is the &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; that you are transforming. So to sum it up, the daily events, the timing of those daily events, think of it, the timing of the daily events in your life is the evidence that the Creative Intelligence is guiding your survival. How you got here tonight and all the incidences that went on for this whole day is far more important than yesterday. And tomorrow isn&rsquo;t here, that&rsquo;s not important, what is important is where you are right now, how you got here. Regardless if you have anguish, frustration, or joyousness you&rsquo;ve got here now. The events that occurred and the timing of how they synchronize to get you here, all the little minute incidences are the actual evidence you have as a living organism of this Creative Intelligence that is locked up in you, embodied in you as respiration and it is directing your existence. So you have that evidence and you have that transformation that is going on but that evidence and transformation began a long time ago, it began in the &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; when you as a sperm and as an ovum bonded. Of all the other sperms you were the winner, you weren&rsquo;t the loser and losers can&rsquo;t be born so welcome aboard winners. You can make yourself losers in the tomorrow thinking or yesterday thinking but you can still be a winner in the Now thinking. We&rsquo;re all entitled to the divine abundance but we can shut it out by divine fear so if you don&rsquo;t exercise it to live in the Now, you&rsquo;ll only reap what &ldquo;Now fear&rdquo; will produce. Wrong timing, that&rsquo;s all fear can produce because you have to go out of timing to suffer. Once you&rsquo;re in time, you don&rsquo;t suffer. For instance an example, somebody is coming down to the bank to borrow some money and you tell them when to come and you only got so much time to keep the place open because you&rsquo;re working on time and the security people are going to close the gate at a certain time and you can only be there at a certain time and you&rsquo;re willing to help the other person. They are in the need, you have the supply, it is how much they want to put out the effort to make &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; function for them, they&rsquo;re gonna be there on time. If they don&rsquo;t want to put it out, the door will close, they don&rsquo;t show up then who are they gonna blame? Then reverse it to yourself, if you&rsquo;re in the same situation and you need to accomplish something, it is how much you generate in your consciousness to be on the time cycle. It synchronizes and you are there. There&rsquo;s an old saying &ldquo;better to be late than never&rdquo; but &ldquo;better to be the last person in heaven before the gate closes.&rdquo; And if you&rsquo;re the last person to step in to heaven before the gates close everyone will be surprised because you&rsquo;ll be taking off your costume and the costume is what people have called the devil in you. You&rsquo;ll hand in your costume and say &ldquo;the game is all over fellas&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s the last person who will come in to heaven when the gate closes, your own self nature that confronts you to look at yourself. See there&rsquo;s really no devil out there but your self nature will push you to look at yourself over and over to organize your thinking and organize your existence. You may not like it, we don&rsquo;t like it when we&rsquo;re children and then we wait till we quit school and go out and do our own thing and then we find out it didn&rsquo;t work and then we got to go back and start organizing again. So our self nature is our own devil or chastisement to bring us back to organized living, organized living is only timing which is health, prosperity, and inward peace. The evidence of this transformation is in the &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; in terms of coping with illness, coping with your daily needs, and your communication with fellow Man, this is the evidence you&rsquo;re looking for all the time. You don&rsquo;t have any other evidence. For instance, we all lie down dead in this room and God walks in and says &ldquo;Hi fellows what do you want? You want your breath back or you want the power to perform miracles or possessions?&rdquo; We&rsquo;re all dead and this is the offer, what are we going to take? You would take your breath back? You don&rsquo;t want powers to perform? Audience: I&rsquo;ll take the powers to perform. Adano: You can perform powers without breathing? Audience: No. (Laughter). Adano: You see how we&rsquo;re all restricted down but nobody is more important than anyone and no one is richer than anyone. We are all equal with the breath but we can make ourselves poor or we can make ourselves unimportant. You see that&rsquo;s the condition that is ours (inaudible) and blame it on others and it&rsquo;s not valid. The breath puts us all equal, what we do with this understanding and how we relate in this understanding determines how we function. We can function to be important to ourselves and we can function to be important to help others so the powers and the possessions are secondary to the breath. The first thing is the breath and once you realize that, that you are that breath, then you can only live in the &ldquo;Now time,&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t live in tomorrow or yesterday, it&rsquo;s not valid. And even all the writings will tell you the worst sinner at the last moment if he said &ldquo;Oh God save me,&rdquo; God would say &ldquo;Yeah come on.&rdquo; Because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Now time.&rdquo; You see there&rsquo;s no tomorrow time in saving and there&rsquo;s no yesterday time, it&rsquo;s Now. Wherever the request is made, it has to be made in the &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; of that person&rsquo;s consciousness so that is why we do have these unusual healings and release from the frustrations and aggravations that pursue us if we recognize the &ldquo;Now time&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the transformation that you see in yourself all the time. We begin to recognize it. 0:30 Sometimes when you meditate, you may feel you&rsquo;re not getting anywhere Sounds familiar? The question is where do you want to go? You&rsquo;ve already arrived, what do you think you&rsquo;re meditating for in the first place? You&rsquo;re not meditating to become more important, you&rsquo;ve already arrived. You&rsquo;re not meditating to become the possessor of all the objects in the world. You know you can&rsquo;t keep it if you don&rsquo;t breathe. Then what is it that we are looking for in the meditation that is of value that we should pursue it? What we&rsquo;re really looking for is the strength to cope with any condition that comes up in the environment. When we open our eyes and move around in the world around us, not to panic. A life without fear, a life with direct objective living. That means if I say something, I&rsquo;ll do it till I finish it. I&rsquo;m not gonna start something I can&rsquo;t finish or take out something that I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to complete. This is what the meditative life tends to do for you. It gives you the strength to fulfill your obligations to yourself, it gives you the endurance, the staying power. After a while you discover there are only two types of people in this world: amateurs and professionals. The amateurs talk all day but when the going gets tough, they&rsquo;re not there to back up what they got to say and the professional doesn&rsquo;t talk much but he is there to the bitter end and that&rsquo;s what you see Brother Jesus was. To the bitter end he was there and what is the reward of such an attitude? It comes from the meditative life, the reward is the power over death. This every Saint or every realized person experiences sooner or later, it&rsquo;s locked up in all of us. We are unconscious cosmic butterflies locked up in a cellular caterpillar. We may not realize it but the environment came before us, so the caterpillar and this transformation to butterfly hood is an obvious model on a cellular level. This cellular form is set up with that embodiment of God for God&rsquo;s glory, not for my glory or your glory, it&rsquo;s for the creative glory. How is it going to glorify itself? Only by raising it above the condition of decomposition, raising it above the level of cell breakdown which is the highest form for immunity and that is divinity. The more you realize your divinity, you are going to experience greater levels of immunity. You&rsquo;re not going to experience guilt, you&rsquo;re not going to experience fear. The purpose of meditating is to bring out this particular fact about yourself, bring it to the surface on a conscious level and you see it, you&rsquo;re able to cope with your environment. The things that you didn&rsquo;t cope with before suddenly you&rsquo;re getting the strength to cope with it, suddenly getting the insight, you&rsquo;re listening to your higher self more and more how to function and if ever you hurt yourself, the recovery rate is speeded up. The first time in my own experience, the recovery rate was fantastic and as the years go by I see the recovery rate is unlimited. So it is not magic, it&rsquo;s the built-in process already set up by the Creative Intelligence, it&rsquo;s a matter of accepting and cleaning it up. You can&rsquo;t drive the car if it&rsquo;s dirty or it&rsquo;s clogged up. It&rsquo;s the same way with this body, you can&rsquo;t get the best out of it it&rsquo;s clogged up and you only have this one to work with. Dead men don&rsquo;t have anything to work with. Now even Jesus will tell you that God is not of the dead, He&rsquo;s of the living so if you expect to find him sitting on a throne waiting for you and saying &ldquo;Hi what do you want?&rdquo; You&rsquo;re going to be mistaken. You know many of us have different notions of what heaven and hell is going to be. Well one time I was told that heaven is a place with pearly gates so I went there to see what pearly gates looked like. It was so beautiful until I opened the gate and I look at the amount of work I&rsquo;ll have to do to clean up all those dirty oyster shells. I said &ldquo;Wow, is this heaven? What a fantasy we&rsquo;ve created.&rdquo; Then I decided to go see what hell looked like, burning place, everybody is burning, only to find out on the other side of the gate all the wood is chopped up waiting to be put in the fire. So I found that &ldquo;I myself am heaven and hell.&rdquo; These labels, these words, these ideas are conditions we place upon our own mind and imprison ourselves and make ourselves sick. And when I let go of it and accepted the reality that while I&rsquo;m in the body, this is the opportunity I have to realize what the Creative Power is, the embodiment of letting it unfold and the obviousness of the caterpillar and the butterfly became more real as an actual model, as a map. Then all the writings where valid to say &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time&rdquo; and &ldquo;If this body throws off corruption and takes on non-corruption, it&rsquo;s a glory unto God.&rdquo; All these ideas became more real from the scientific viewpoint. Meditation was no longer a fantasy or a pastime for people who (inaudible) escaped the world. Actual meditation is living in the world moment-to-moment with confrontations and gathering the strength to cope with it and seeing the results in your daily encounter with it. So you have one, a recovery rate of the skin to heal itself. Two, a sense of strength to cope with situations, you don&rsquo;t bog down or get depressed too easy, you can cope with a lot of conditions that normally you would not be able to cope. A sense of timing, which is called Divine Will, you&rsquo;re the right place at the right time for the right experience and the experience is neither good or bad, it&rsquo;s just an opportunity to test your love. Now testing your love is very strange because somebody may abuse your love and you may feel very hurt, you&rsquo;ve done so much for them and then they turn around and hurt you and don&rsquo;t appreciate what you did and the first thing you want to do is hit them back on the head. Well that&rsquo;s the opportunity but again the condition is one that you can also generate compassion. 0:40 We have a good model in Jesus. When they took him and nailed him to a cross after all the things he did for them, they still nailed him to a cross and he still says &ldquo;Father forgive them for they know not what they do&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t know how many people have the guts to say it. I don&rsquo;t say I could at that point, it will take a lot of meditation to generate that type of compassion but we we are human beings and given enough time we can come to that level of compassion. So that is something that is locked up in us because it does open doors of compassion from challenge. The more challenges come up and the more we involve ourselves in the meditation, the strength to cope with it begins to manifest. The things that you would not normally forgive years ago, you find yourself forgiving and you have a much broader outlook to react. Audience: We often talk about the Divine Intelligence of God. On the one hand we know that God is beyond any speculation yet if we consider the spiritual hierarchy or consider the evolution, can we perhaps venture to think that God is made up of all the Souls of the perfected men and women who abandoned their humanness to become divine? Adano: Yes, no, maybe. (Laughter). We are extensions of that one consciousness called God. There&rsquo;s only one Soul, there&rsquo;s not thousands of Souls in this universe. Man is Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t have Soul. That&rsquo;s factual, that can be experienced and he has to come to grips with the understanding of it. You are Soul. Now let me explain that this object is made of clay, right? It&rsquo;s made with pigment and now it contains liquid. This object has a name, can you show me the name? Audience: No. Adano: Good but everyone who calls this object by its name agrees that that name will always be in your head as long as you live. Even if I take it and smash it up I cannot get rid of the what? The name. So Soul is that phenomena to which we ascribe our form and label it. We are put together as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism so the chemical body is called the physical body. The electrical body is called the astral body. The magnetic body is called the causal body and they&rsquo;re spun together in a force field called Spirit or spiraling. What are you going to label this mass if you don&rsquo;t breathe into it? Now, the moment breath of life enters, the embodiment is accomplished, that embodiment labels it Soul. When this is all finished you have to label it something to identify it. Now what is unique about this cup after we call it cup, we can start the process of refining its texture making a much more delicate looking cup or a gross heavy bulky looking cup. A refinement process of consciousness goes on in the body. The consciousness uses the body for refinement so is the consciousness refined or is the body refined? Is the label refined or the container refined? You ever seen some nice delicate oriental cups and big huge ones and they still call them cup, right? But they have nice artwork and so forth and that&rsquo;s exactly what consciousness is doing on this mass, refining it. And what is the purpose of the refinement? It is to enhance the quality of intelligence. So the more you&rsquo;re inspired, that means the more you breathe in, the more you breathe air into your mechanism and less of carbon dioxide, the more you transform the cells and release the divinity of the cell and the manifestation of what is called Divine-hood, Master-hood, Saint-hood is evidence. Not prior to death, it is at death we check out if you made it. We can&rsquo;t check a butterfly before the caterpillar gives up, do you follow? And by virtue of that, even I sitting here talking, I could be as phony as the dust in the air. (Gap in tape) &hellip;that&rsquo;s where we are but I have to act it out. This &ldquo;I AM-ness&rdquo; has to act out in these cells the allotted task of staying in a body, subject to all kinds of aches and pains and go through the process of self-refining by conscious attitude and only the intelligence grants the reward but it&rsquo;s already locked up in the mechanism to where you manifest it but you cannot manifest it prior. You will have instances or glimpses of it occurring prior to the turning off of the mechanism, that the body is capable of withstanding high levels of pain, high levels of injuries, and function in conditions that would seem highly impossible for the average person to function. You have a lot of evidence of that in many of the people who we call Saints, in their life. There is a good example of the Saint from Lourdes, Bernadette. While she was alive, she was suffering from cancer and yet the sister superior would give her all kinds of work to do because she seemed to be so slow, never realizing that this girl was having all this kind of illness until one day she fainted away in the church and when they got the doctor and the doctor examined her, he couldn&rsquo;t even realize how she was alive. She should have been dead and then that same sister superior became her help-mate because she saw what was going on in the body. The compassionate nature opened up for her now and yet in Bernadette&rsquo;s consciousness, the pain didn&rsquo;t seem to be important, what is important is that she tried to fulfill obligations. It&rsquo;s the same with the caterpillar, he&rsquo;s eating his way to butterfly-hood, the only thing that can happen to him is if you step on him before he does it himself, then he&rsquo;ll never make butterfly-hood, he will remain there and decompose. But if he makes it on his own by sticking it out and transforms into the butterfly, you&rsquo;ll never find a decaying butterfly. I&rsquo;ve spent too many times studying their bodies, they don&rsquo;t decay but I studied caterpillars that are hurt and die, they all decay. And I&rsquo;ve studied the bodies of people too that are open for observation that are considered Saints in the non-decaying state. 0:50 The evidence is there, we are the ones that are selling the cell short. All the great Saints that come in that we pray and glorify, they are examples of that consistency of the consciousness. They are the examples and the models for us to awaken something that is locked up in us and they may come with different approaches or techniques, all roads lead to God. That&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;the truth is one, the paths are many.&rdquo; The one truth is still the same, a non-decomposing body or pick it up and take it away and leave an empty coffin for the world to wonder. You know Master Jesus walked away from his, all we have is a shroud and today the shroud is being debated, is it valid or is it a hoax? But the type of artwork and the way it&rsquo;s put together, we didn&rsquo;t have any artists of the caliber to draw human anatomy that good yet. Let alone we don&rsquo;t have the people to weave that material so we&rsquo;re stuck with an evidence of an actual truth. Kabir lived around the 1600 period, he tried to unite Muslims and Hindus and he gave his life doing that and the day he was ready to die, he looked around and fell over and he was in a coffin. Well Hindus by tradition cremate their dead. The Mohammedans or Muslims by tradition bury their dead. So the argument begins now, since he was a patron to both of them trying to lift them up or unite them in consciousness, each one wanted to perform his own personal funeral right on the body. So the argument begins, should we cremate or should we bury the body? And while they were busy arguing back and forth to cremate or bury the body, Kabir got up and looked at them, shook his head. After he shook his head and disappeared right in front of them and left them the empty coffin and in the empty coffin he left two roses. Well the Hindus took their rose and the Muslims took their rose, the Hindus cremated their rose and the Muslims buried theirs. And the coffin is still there, empty. So you see tradition never dies out, fixations of yesterday are with us, the reality has come and gone and God is like that, all the time imposing the unexpected and maybe God has something more important for all of us. Ever new unfoldment is the reality of God in all of us. Volkswagen once made cars and sent them to America and we all recognize it, we bought it, the Beetle you know. But after many years what happened to us? We got bored right? That&rsquo;s a funny phenomenon of the human brain and they began to lose their business because nobody would buy the Beetle and creativity became stagnant until they realized they had to do something to raise their business again and start a new consciousness in their vehicle. Ever newness is something that everyone carries inside. It takes modern Man to find that God is that power that generates ever newness. Years ago when Yogananda was alive, he was coming out of a brand new Cadillac and there were several people standing around and one man mentally remarked and said &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s a Swami, why is he driving in a Cadillac? Swamis are supposed to renounce the world and live in very mediocre existence and have nothing to do with the abundance of the world.&rdquo; Yogananda was not introduced to this man, he didn&rsquo;t even know the man&rsquo;s name but he turned around and looked directly to the man and said &ldquo;Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; that really freaked the guy out because how did he know his name, they never met? &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for this Cadillac, it was given to me. In fact, it&rsquo;s a poor expression of Man&rsquo;s creativity, looking forward to a better model next year&rdquo; and he walked away. (Laughter). What is he telling us, what are all these Saints telling us? We are selling ourselves short, we&rsquo;re not selling our s-e-l-f short, we are selling our c-e-l-l short. We don&rsquo;t give it credit, we want to dump it off with something to throw away and get rid of when in actuality it carries the embodiment of God, a Principle that will constantly surprise the mechanism in the form of consciousness. Our apparent consciousness that we think we are so great that you can hear and record and understand me, what do you think it is? It&rsquo;s the oxygen. If you don&rsquo;t breathe it, I have to bury you. And when you breathe it, all that&rsquo;s going to happen is that your lungs are going to puff up and puff down. And it&rsquo;s that puffing up we call ego and that flattening out is what you call depression or &ldquo;why me and why not you?&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s in that on-going principle, this quality of creativeness is possible. We will never become God with a human body but God will become us embodied in the body and allow us to experience our God-ness in it. That&rsquo;s all we can really experience, God-ness, we can&rsquo;t become God. God has already become His creation, He&rsquo;s already embodied in the creation. He&rsquo;s not embodied in death. So you&rsquo;re not going to find Him sitting on a throne when you die. Now nothing really dies because that&rsquo;s what Saint Paul says, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord&rdquo; meaning what? He breathes in life and breathes out life, leaving the body to dilate and constrict producing the phenomena called death or life. Now if you get down into the actual physics to see what you&rsquo;re doing to yourself, then you can see what God is and all the Saints are expressions of that principle &ldquo;God is&rdquo; and you too in time and I in time, everyone in time, will be an extension of that principle, &ldquo;God is,&rdquo; with the mechanism we have to work with. 1:00 Now when we close our eyes to sleep at night, the body goes into a form of what, relaxation or constriction? We agree it&rsquo;s relaxation, not constriction? Good, but are we conscious when we sleep? Some people are to some extent but then they become unconscious. Does their heart and the lungs stop when you sleep? Audience: No. Adano: Okay then we can say sleep is only &ldquo;unconscious,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re not conscious it&rsquo;s unconscious, &ldquo;sensory&rdquo; that the five senses are shut down, &ldquo;motor&rdquo; that is the muscle and nerves are relaxed, &ldquo;relaxation.&rdquo; Organs like heart and lungs don&rsquo;t shut off, they keep pumping in spite of the fact you don&rsquo;t even remember you&rsquo;re a man or a woman when you sound asleep and you&rsquo;ve got no guarantee that you&rsquo;re going to wake up and the funny thing is when you go to sleep, you got to tell yourself you&rsquo;re going to wake up first before you go to sleep. You&rsquo;ll never fall asleep without telling yourself you&rsquo;re going to wake up. So you&rsquo;re pre-programming expectancy to get up like an alarm clock to yourselves. You do it to yourself, you take it for granted, but never realizing you&rsquo;re working with cosmic physics all the time. The expectancy to reactivate the organism is set in when you put the body in a state of shutdown. Now let&rsquo;s take that one step further where you&rsquo;re unconscious, the senses are shut off, the motor functions are shut off, and the heart and lungs are shut off, and you&rsquo;re in a state of relaxation, what would they call you now? Dead man or dead woman and in that state you don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;re a man or a woman and to come back and tell me as an invisible object calling itself a Spirit, &ldquo;hey look at me,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s another built-in relationship because Spirit doesn&rsquo;t have no sex, it&rsquo;s a force field that only patterns to the geometry and it&rsquo;s not important to the occupant, it&rsquo;s only important to the observer because once it&rsquo;s shut down, it&rsquo;s floating around like like an electrical charge. It doesn&rsquo;t have any shape, I the observer, I the living person have to give it some kind of shape. I can be sitting down in this room and suddenly I feel &ldquo;Oh, I feel cold, I feel warm, oh boy. Some spirit must be walking around this room, maybe it&rsquo;s Aunt Mary or Uncle Joe&rdquo; and then I am labeling it, I am already giving it geometry. As far as the pressure of that force field on my body, it might be the oxygen trying to get back in at a different rate and I&rsquo;m totally ignorant of it but I will call it Aunt Mary or Uncle Joe and get locked up in all kind of crazy games, even to go to get somebody to what? De-ghost me? But we do that to ourselves and we can&rsquo;t blame nobody if they make that kind of mistake because we will make it ourselves. Audience: Is it okay if we take a break now and then we&rsquo;ll come back for just a few more questions before we close? (Gap in tape). Adano: As I was saying, death is &ldquo;unconscious sensory motor organic&rdquo; now, that&rsquo;s the organs the heart and lungs, &ldquo;relaxation,&rdquo; they are relaxed. There are two stages of death: clinical death and terminal death, they&rsquo;re both mentioned in the biblical writings. Clinical death is not a &ldquo;death unto the death&rdquo; that was referred to by Jesus of Lazarus. Also clinical death is referred to in the case of Jairus&rsquo;s daughter, when the father came to Jesus and told him his daughter was dead according to the physicians and he remarked &ldquo;she sleeps.&rdquo; Well you can imagine the mentality of the people at the time, death is death when the person don&rsquo;t move, right? But how many are trained into the specifics of scientific knowledge of the body to know it&rsquo;s valid and he&rsquo;s talking from an inner awareness of what degree the body is shut down so that is referred to as clinical death. Therefore in clinical death we always see people reactivating themselves, they usually may come back but terminal death they don&rsquo;t come back, they break down and decompose. So even Lazarus was not in a terminal death state, he was in a clinical death state but these people are unconscious, they&rsquo;re not conscious. Birth is the direct opposite to death. It&rsquo;s a conscious state, the senses and the motor functions are working, and the organs have to work, that is the heart and the lungs. If they don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have to bury the mechanism because it&rsquo;s not breathing. That&rsquo;s life. In the Eastern tradition they call it Prana. In the scientific awareness in today&rsquo;s technology, this prana is the oxygenation of the cells, the timing of the cells, the actual biorhythm, innervation of the cells which produces the phenomena called consciousness. Only in the oxygen does this particular phenomena start to manifest, it doesn&rsquo;t manifest in carbon dioxide, it doesn&rsquo;t manifest in nitrogen, neither does it manifest in hydrogen but wherever there is oxygen, it will manifest. There&rsquo;s a direct link. The added atoms of oxygen are involved with the continuity of life. That is what leads to the strange phenomena called Kundalini, most of us don&rsquo;t even know what it represents and have these phenomenons going on the body or what is the cornerstone behind it. It is oxygenation. The body at birth does not relax it constricts, it goes into a state of tension so to be alive you&rsquo;ve got to be in a state of tension and to be dead you have got to be in a state of relaxation, this is factual about your mechanism. So the living man lives in a state of tension and to say that he&rsquo;s going to get rid of all his tension is erroneous if he wants to live but if he wants to control the degree of the tension to give him the capacity to work with the mechanism, this is within his control. This is the art of living and dying that Paul mentioned, it&rsquo;s a respiratory science that controls the constriction and the dilation or the tension or the relaxation of the cellular structure. You are given that control at one point in your life, it&rsquo;s called initiation. It&rsquo;s like handing you the key to the car while you&rsquo;re a passenger all your life and one day somebody hands you the key knowing you can drive the car and you have a permit and therefore you are in charge of the vehicle now. Master power is in you, you work with Master power which you call Kundalini, you take the responsibility to vibrate that engine and put it in motion, you take the responsibility of guiding it through the force fields around you. 1:10 It moves within your own body, the spinal column is set up already for this innervation like a tree trunk. The divisions along the spine are set up like transformers, if you want to say the human being is a seven cylinder piston vehicle but at the same time he&rsquo;s a shuttle, a rocket, and a satellite all in one, a video and a radio computer all locked up in one. Name any invention you want in your environment and you&rsquo;ll find it in the body because it has to come there from the subliminal chemistry. This oscillation in the spine is transferred to you on a conscious level to make you responsible for your behavior. Now there is another way this condition can be experienced, it&rsquo;s experienced by transmission. That is when you&rsquo;re a passenger in the car and somebody is teaching you to drive and they&rsquo;re sitting on the right side of the steering wheel and you&rsquo;re behind the steering wheel but they&rsquo;re controlling the braking of the car by a rod that runs across to their foot anytime you&rsquo;re going to bump into the car that you don&rsquo;t have any control because you&rsquo;re learning to drive. Have you ever learned to drive and been in a car where the driver is you and the teacher is the person sitting next to you? Well those cars do exist and that also is another form of how the energy is activated, we can regulate it. In the classical church process that is known as Pentecostal, &ldquo;slain in the spirit&rdquo; is another name given to the Pentecostal experience. In the time of Jesus, when he came back from the grave and he ascended before his disciples, he said &ldquo;I go unto the Father but I&rsquo;ll send you the Holy Comforter who will remind you of all these things in my name.&rdquo; The Christ principle ascends in all of us but the subtle working of the total spirit can come in two ways, you in control or it comes down on you and activates you. If it comes down and activate you, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;slain in the spirit,&rdquo; born again, charismatic action, that&rsquo;s the teacher sitting in the car next to you putting the brakes on because you forgot to put the brakes when the 18 wheeler was crossing in front of you and you&rsquo;re really slain in the spirit if you hit it but he would step on so fast, you&rsquo;ll rock back in your seat and thanks for the buckle that you got, you don&rsquo;t break your neck but that&rsquo;s exactly what we call &ldquo;slain in the spirit,&rdquo; you will learn about your own energy fields then very fast. So if you are initiated and you&rsquo;re given the key to drive the vehicle, then the gradual release of the force field as it unfolds in you is at your command. Then there is the grace. The grace comes by the transference of the teacher to the student. The man who initiated me into Swamihood was initiated as a boy around 18 years of age by his teacher. He lived together with Gandhi when Gandhi was alive and all the years of his meditation, he never saw anything in his meditation, it was totally blank. He went to prison, came out of prison, he rebuilt his business, and he lost his daughter and his son. But when he was 60 years of age and ready to retire, he decided he wanted to pursue the spiritual life and he went to see his teacher. His teacher was living up in the mountains so he made the long journey up and when he got there his teacher said &ldquo;What do you want, what did you come here for?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Sir, only out of respect for you since you initiated me as a boy I&rsquo;ve done the meditation but all my friends have had wonderful experiences, they have had opening up of powers and everything, I haven&rsquo;t seen or felt anything to this very day, I&rsquo;m just an ordinary man, I&rsquo;ve been to jail and everything, I&rsquo;m ready to retire but I haven&rsquo;t accomplished anything, I&rsquo;m still a blank in my head.&rdquo; Well the teacher was very compassionate and this is what he said &ldquo;Get the hell out of here and don&rsquo;t come back no more!&rdquo; He said &ldquo;What?&rdquo; And he slammed the door in his face, that&rsquo;s how compassionate the teacher was. Then he sat there for a while and he said &ldquo;Okay what am I gonna do?&rdquo; He went down to the bottom of the mountain, it was dark and he couldn&rsquo;t go home to the city so we stayed in a little camp. Still out of respect for the teacher, he sat down to meditate and do what he was told to do in his meditation and he said to me &ldquo;Adano, in a split second when I closed my eyes, my head became like a Fourth of July. From that day to now, I&rsquo;m 80 some odd years of age, with my eyes open and shut, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it&rsquo;s still Fourth of July.&rdquo; Now you see how compassionate the teacher was? But then he found out that the teacher didn&rsquo;t live too long after that and this is what we call &ldquo;the passing of the grace&rdquo; because then he took over and carried on but he&rsquo;s making reference to how this force works, it&rsquo;s a yes, no, maybe. We don&rsquo;t have any particular one process to fit it. Your particular karmic condition or responsibility to it determines how you will experience it. So each one of us has a role to perform, we just have to go through that role and the end result is we reap the cosmic Oscar. You may call it Moksha or liberation because that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re going through. Audience: Is that a process that everyone is really going through whether they know they&rsquo;re going through it or not? I mean do you have to be consciously seeking something? I mean obviously everybody is here because they&rsquo;re seeking something and there are a lot of people who shy away from from even the idea of seeking something but does the process take place regardless of a conscious effort or doesn&rsquo;t it? Adano: Yes no maybe. Yes it is going on in spite of you at its own evolutionary rate or the planet revolving on its axis, revolving around the sun, with the sun and all the other planets revolving around Alpha Centauri every 24,000 years, and Alpha Centauri with all the rest of planets around it revolving around another sun in the universe an extra 240,000,000 years and it&rsquo;s going on like that regardless of you being conscious of it at an intellectual level. But then you have &ldquo;no,&rdquo; seeking for it is an unfinished process left in the memory bank of having started it and never completed it. &ldquo;To him that overcometh I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; This might be your hundred millionth second time, you don&rsquo;t know. Therefore you have the urge to look for it because the unfinished memory is there. 1:20 So when you meet people who are craving and looking for some completeness, it&rsquo;s because in the memory bank, the unfinished process is going on and stirring them to be there. This unfinished memory bank has to be satisfied in one life form or the other. Now why one incarnation is impossible to resolve all the problems, the principle of energy indicates it&rsquo;s very difficult to do that. Energy according to the formula is energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared. Now the velocity of light is 186,000 miles a second and if you just stretch that out in distance and try to divide that into a human body living in Arizona talking, the energy that goes out of your body is traveling across this planet which is approximately eight thousand miles in diameter and Mrs. Nero may be sitting in her office right now. You may be saying something to her but she may not hear it yet whatever you have said is traveling right across to her and hitting her body and coming back to you in a matter of 22 to 23 times a second. If you take 8,000 and divide it into 186,000, that&rsquo;s how fast this energy field is bombarding all of us. When you begin to realize the mathematics now of its squared, the energy field now times your body weight and if you only live 100 years minimum or maximum in an incarnation and you try to stretch that out in terms of years, how long does it take to use up that energy? You can never really use up all the energy of one body mass to compensate or correct the mistakes you make in one incarnation. So God in his glory-ness and His expansiveness provides you repetition in the form of reincarnating. So when Jesus came to the river Jordan, he looked at John and this was the remark he made, &ldquo;There is no man born of a woman greater than John who is Elijah that has come.&rdquo; And everybody didn&rsquo;t understand what he&rsquo;s talking about, yet some of them who understood he was saying John the Baptist was actually Elijah come back and that the life of Elijah was too short enough to warrant all the development that Elijah could perform, he had to come back as John to carry on the work. So we see that we have ongoing process on a conscious level and he was consciously stating it. Now maybe that to search is an indication that your lost. This is not a search for God, most of us assume that this is a search for God. Our existence is not a search for God, our existence is to release the God within us. God is already embodied in you as the Creative Word, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh and dwell in Man,&rdquo; in this manifestation. We as manifestation have to release it by coming to grips with it. The only way we can come to grips with the Word, we have to listen. We can&rsquo;t see the Word, we can only hear the Word and to hear the Word is to listen. So in listening you take your ego out of the way because you follow instructions by listening, you don&rsquo;t follow instructions by talking. You can&rsquo;t talk to someone while they&rsquo;re giving you instructions, you&rsquo;ll confuse yourself, you have to listen to get the instructions to function. So your organism is set up to come to grips with the internal sonics by the process of listening to the internal sonics and this will lead you back to the source of your nature which is the God in you. Now that God in you is the capacity to actualize what you say. Imagine Jesus saying &ldquo;Lazarus come forth!&rdquo; And hear Lazarus, &ldquo;No Lord, I ain&rsquo;t getting up for you, man I&rsquo;m enjoying this coffin.&rdquo; This is gonna be a tug of war of wills now. If Lazarus is evolved like the Master Jesus, it would be a tug of war of wills but Lazarus was not there, Lazarus was in a clinical death state needing help from the teacher who gives the command to make the actualization occur. So we are not searching. Searching means you&rsquo;re lost, we are not lost, we are embodied with God working towards the release. Superman is locked up in Clark Kent. Clark Kent isn&rsquo;t looking for Superman, he&rsquo;s got to release it. Equally true Sainthood or Divine-hood is locked up in all of us as Soul, we have to release it. So you get the right perspective, then there is no competition. Everyone has his full view, his full measure coming to him, he just got to let it come to the surface. &ldquo;Let go, let God.&rdquo; These are all different ways to look at it but in the actual physics, it is that you are the embodiment and it is locked up in the sonics of your own voice. What you say to your cells, actualize it, but the conviction is very hard to contain or demonstrate at times because we have doubt and we have disappointments over the years growing up that when we say things, it didn&rsquo;t materialize. But you will find that when you begin to meditate, in the early stages of your meditation many of the things you say to yourself may not materialize but after you begin to clean up the body and get the mind to focus properly, you&rsquo;ll surprise yourself that whatever you say begins to materialize. The first time something like that happened to me once, I was very very shocked because I realized what a dangerous thing I could be if I didn&rsquo;t know what to say and I can see why the Creative Intelligence blocks this particular condition immediately in the untrained mind. Because if you say something and it happens immediately, you don&rsquo;t have any recourse, your own mouth is your own downfall. So you have to have some type of an insulator against making mistakes by saying things that you don&rsquo;t intend to say. Imagine we go around saying to someone &ldquo;oh buzz off.&rdquo; Now if you actualize everything you say and you said &ldquo;buzz off&rdquo; and they took off in the room like this, right in front of you they sprouted their flying capacity, you realize what you&rsquo;ve done. So realized people are not people who use their voice to actualize anything without due understanding of the purpose of their existence but that is locked up in you, that&rsquo;s God, the potency of the Word. That&rsquo;s why the ancient people always say &ldquo;speak the truth.&rdquo; 1:30 Now if you speak truth that means you&rsquo;re speaking fact. If you speak fact, it actualizes then the code of the West or the law of the West in this country is &ldquo;a man is only as good as his word.&rdquo; We begin there making our words actual actions and finally it does crystallize that whatever you say is an actuality. We can&rsquo;t create with the Word, we can only duplicate what is already here. So for example when the people were short of bread and fish and they were hungry, the Master Jesus turned to one of his disciples and says &ldquo;Go buy some bread,&rdquo; he said go buy it, that means he must obey the laws of the environment and the disciple went out to buy the bread and found out he didn&rsquo;t have enough money to buy the bread for the amount of people that were there. He came back and told the teacher, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have the money.&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t materialize money, that&rsquo;s forgery. So then he says &ldquo;What have they got?&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t manifest what he would like to give them, that&rsquo;s against the principle of freedom of thinking, &ldquo;what have they got&rdquo; and they found that it was a young boy who had a couple of loaves and fishes that his mother had given him as a lunch so he offered it up. They said &ldquo;he blessed it and gave them to eat.&rdquo; That means he multiplied it, he didn&rsquo;t create it. An engineer friend of mine, when I was in California we were discussing Solar Nutrition and the atomic physics that&rsquo;s involved just to manifest one fish, 12 inches long, 1.5 pounds in body weight, how much energy would be required to take it from a nine month growth pattern into a nine second manifestation. When we finished calculating it on the computer, he looked at me and says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have that power yet.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Now imagine one thousand, four thousand, if it took that much energy to manifest one fish in nine seconds that would take nine months to grow from its own natural mechanics and reduce it down, what did this great teacher do? He didn&rsquo;t create anything, he compressed time, and in his compressing of time by his own voice, he was able to compress time which we called miracle. There are no miracles but there is that Divine Principle locked up in Man as his voice, God, the Creative Power that can compress the atomic force into any shape to satisfy the need providing the occupant is in a state of cleanliness. So the cleanliness is the individual must act what they say, you can&rsquo;t be any cleaner than that. That&rsquo;s why there is no commandment &ldquo;Thou shalt not lie.&rdquo; (Gap in tape). &hellip;read the Autobiography of a Yogi, many manifestations and there is a Saint today, his name (inaudible), he lives in India, his name is Satya Sai Baba and he manifests right in front of your eyes various objects on the command of the voice. He is not performing no magic, far from it, we understand these laws when we understand what they&rsquo;re doing inside. There is no magic going on in God-men, God-men are working with the principle of God, sonics, over the atomic field. That&rsquo;s why that one statement &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; the Audible Life Stream. &ldquo;And the Word was with God,&rdquo; the Creative Consciousness. &ldquo;And the Word was God,&rdquo; creative life. &ldquo;And the word was made flesh,&rdquo; slowed down atoms. &ldquo;And dwells in Man&rdquo; or the manifestation of the atom as voice. The evidence you have today is your own voice when you apply it. Meditation just happens to be a plug-in device like you plug a cord into the socket and turn on the switch and the equipment goes, you have your plugin.</p>
<h2 id="1984-july-26---sedona-sermon-on-the-mount">1984 July 26 - Sedona Sermon on the Mount</h2>
<p>Adano84_07_26SedonaSermonontheMountQ2NW1 - Audience: This is indeed a very auspicious occasion for Jeanette and myself. Most of you, certainly many of you know of Adano and his background. I&rsquo;ll relate it very briefly. Adano was born in British Guiana of a Oriental father and a Spanish Carob Indian mother. He has a background both in Catholicism and in Buddhism which I guess puts the lie to what Rudyard Kipling said that the East and West will never meet because obviously the East and West are meeting. He came to this country briefly and then spent some time in Montreal Canada with the Self-Realization Center there. He is a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda and also spent some very interesting time with native North Americans in the United States and Mexico and in 1969 he became a Swami in the Saraswati discipline and since then for a number of years Adano has a clinic in Houston. He is a practicing naturopathic physician and he&rsquo;s also an expert in acupuncture, acupressure, and in Chinese medical treatment. I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of knowing Adano for not very long. I know him as a very gentle, very humble, very beautiful person, and it&rsquo;s our honor, Jeanette and I, to have you in our home tonight, to have you with us. Adano, the evening is yours. Adano: Thank you everyone and my wonderful hosts and Margaret for getting me here. Sedona, this is my second visit here, not in this spot but in the actual town of Sedona years ago I came here and this where I met Chief War Eagle and we became very good friends and those who know him, his name is Andy Scott. He lives in Taylor, Arizona but it was in Sedona while passing through here and at the same time Kriyananda was doing a retreat. We crossed paths and that&rsquo;s how I met my friend Chief War Eagle and I always promised to come back to Sedona and so today is more of a treat and a fulfillment. (Long meditation). 0:33 Slowly open your eyes and try to hold on to the peace, halfway open and halfway closed. After you come out of meditation, that&rsquo;s how you evaluate the depth of the meditation, how long the peace stayed with you. I&rsquo;ve been asked to talk on the Sermon on the Mount. Most of us have been exposed to what Jesus taught at the Sermon on the Mount but there are other things concerning that sermon which the average person is not aware of and even those who wrote it and recorded it did not infer too much. There is a relationship going on between the multitude, the student, and the teacher. The intimate exchange of spiritual ideas between the teacher and the student is not recognized or experienced by the multitude. That is why this particular process exists, a sort of a teacher/student relationship. The general public cannot be exposed to a direct psychophysical transformation on certain spiritual experiences but between the teacher and the student, that psychophysical exchange occurs every instant. In a group meeting like this, what we call Satsang or &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst,&rdquo; many of us don&rsquo;t even know the extent of that statement, what is actually occurring. It takes many years to uncover that intimate exchange between a realized person and the student. The Sermon on the Mount was not just given for the public, it was given primarily for those 12 men who lived with Jesus and how to break their internal frustrations in their meditational process and how to arrive at an inward accomplishment in a very deep intimate psychophysical exchange, a transformation of their body, an actual bodily transformation for those men. It&rsquo;s more than just a sermon on top of a mountain. To the average person, it sounds like a sermon on the mountain but to a the student on the path of truth, it&rsquo;s his encounter with God in the realized man that opens avenues of power locked up in the student. For instance if a student is suffering with frustration from being hurt by people who pick on him but they can&rsquo;t release it, how is the teacher going to break through that pattern and heal that person to open that they will become a channel for that teacher? He may give a counsel, some type of a statement that a student can relate to, that the general public can also relate to but would it help the general public? The student is the person that the teacher is more concerned with because he is the one that&rsquo;s going to have to carry on when the teacher is gone in that process of self understanding, the process of self transformation. The general public will come and go so in the Eastern countries they say a teacher is like an elephant, he has a pair of tusks that keeps away the public from attacking him and his teeth is what he chews food with and that&rsquo;s what the organs are fed with and that&rsquo;s the disciple. His actual body is his disciple where he chews his food and nurtures it but the tusks keep everybody away from hurting him. The general public is not a disciple in the presence of realized people, only the intimacy that occurs with those who are ready for the path that has an interconnectedness and that&rsquo;s why this type of tradition goes on, it will not stop. When Jesus was asked the way of truth he said, &ldquo;None come unto the Father but by me.&rdquo; The general public didn&rsquo;t understand what he was talking about &ldquo;but suffer it to be so for this is the way of righteousness.&rdquo; It is the transformation that occurs between the realized person and the unrealized person as a bond which they call teacher/disciple relationship and when the two have arrived at that transformation, there is no teacher/disciple, it&rsquo;s enough that they are friends because they&rsquo;ve both broken the internal conflicts that separates them from the unified process of Beingness but the general public can&rsquo;t experience that. 0:40 So until we realize what the Sermon on the Mount is involved with, we may go off in tangents trying to interpret the meanings of what he said. But then we look at it from the level of a disciple and a teacher relationship and not as a someone giving a sermon on a pulpit or a mountain top for the general public, we&rsquo;re gonna experience something entirely different, far more intimate with the Creative Process and with the God-nature locked up in ourselves. Number one, Jesus attained his Christ-hood. That Christ-hood is present in all of us when you recognize it and when you realize it, that&rsquo;s why he says &ldquo;As many as received me, to them gave he the power to become sons of God.&rdquo; When you recognize your Christ-hood in you, you are a living example of the sons of God, the Christ power but it&rsquo;s in you. The disciple is one who takes on the responsibility to make the transformation from inside. When he takes this responsibility to make this transformation inside, he needs direction and how is he to know that this direction that he&rsquo;s going in is going to be of value? It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re trying to teach somebody something to do and if you don&rsquo;t give them some standards to work by, how are they gonna know if they&rsquo;re making progress? So those twelve disciples were given certain standards to work with. Therefore the very first word in one of the measurements of the inward growth is &ldquo;blessed.&rdquo; Have you ever thought of that? How can that be for the multitude? It is not something intended for the multitude, it would be something intended for someone who is involved in an intimate connectedness with a teacher. Some type of transformation that must occur in that person&rsquo;s internal nature to raise them from a level of self-destruction to a level of self-acceptance and self-effulgence. You can&rsquo;t get this transformation just openly saying it on a pulpit or reading it from a book. All the readings of how to drive a car doesn&rsquo;t get you behind the wheel and equally true all the readings of the scripture writings will not transform you from inside your nature. It&rsquo;ll get you thinking along those lines, it may commit you to want to find out what can be done but until you get behind that wheel or until you get into that internal transmutation, that internal transformation as an individual from a gross level behavior to a more refined level of behavior, you need help, you need some type of a monitoring process to get you there. You wouldn&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going right or wrong. And especially when one is trying to realize his God-nature, it&rsquo;s not an easy thing to realize. So those statements have very very deep psychophysical, therapeutic processes involved with them but the average person would not know that until they encounter it and work with it and then it begins to open up. Let&rsquo;s take one and I&rsquo;ll work it through with you so you can understand that when you go back to read it. Now, don&rsquo;t read it like an ordinary person reading it, read it as one who has been it into the inner awareness of your in-depth qualities and let it unfold for you. It&rsquo;s a formula number one, it&rsquo;s more than just a statement. It&rsquo;s actually a very deep psychophysical spiritual formula for unlocking the reservoir of your higher potential, but you don&rsquo;t know that and a teacher can&rsquo;t up and dump it like that on the public. You can&rsquo;t expect somebody to tell you how to do something which would be unprepared like the general public. He knew his disciples were on the path, he knew there were a lot of people around, but he had to give them, for the time he was allotted to stay with them, data or insight; all the necessary methods of how to make the internal transformation as well as personally transforming them by being among them. That&rsquo;s why a living person is more important to extract the tooth from your mouth than one in a book. You can read of all the great dentists that take teeth out of the mouth you know but you need a living one to take that one out of your mouth. So you do need some living person to integrate for you the qualities of a spiritual life. (Gap in tape). Years ago when I used to read, when I was studying to be a priest, all these things were so far fetched and yet I was fortunate to meet Yogananda living in the body. The experience was to pull together certain internal qualities for me to center me so that I can open from within myself what the real truths are all about and it comes back to the Sermon on the Mount. So &ldquo;blessed.&rdquo; When we think of this word do you realize what a tremendous power is imparted to the initiate? Not just the general public because the general public is not involved in the process, it&rsquo;s the disciples that were involved in the process. They were empowered right away with it because a realized man can&rsquo;t say something that he cannot demonstrate; that&rsquo;s his realization: he has to live his own words. God-men live their words so if he said &ldquo;blessed are they,&rdquo; right away he&rsquo;s pouring out subtle transformations within the mechanism of the listener. The multitude may get some kind of an exchange but the in-depth transmutation, the in-depth transformation is in the student that is learning to unfold. &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,&rdquo; right? The very first real formula. Reading it or hearing it like that to the layman he&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Well poor in spirit means what?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stupid, cheap, lacking, and if I don&rsquo;t do anything, I&rsquo;ll inherit heaven.&rdquo; You can get all kind of notions about the whole statement and never really get an internal transmutation of what is intended between the realized man and the student who is on the path. Years ago when I came across it, I too labored under that situation not knowing what was the real transmutation and the real accomplishment of that statement. But when it was revealed and pulled together by the teacher, then qualities open for the first time. 0:50 What we call &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; is a gradual permeation of the whole physical body going into a state of relaxation. All the tension and the stress that the body has been subjected to prior to that moment begins to recede. There&rsquo;s a quality that comes in, your breathing expands, and there&rsquo;s a sense of cellular washing, a sense of cellular cleansing that starts to occur. Anyone who has pursued meditation will tell you, in the early stages of their meditation life can be pretty miserable because all the aggravations come up to aggravate you and distract you and before you know it you wish you never got into this process of wanting to know about the Creative Principles or God. &ldquo;But suffer it to be so, this is the way of truth,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the way we have to go, you have to be cleansed up and it&rsquo;s not just taking a bath or stop eating wrong foods, it&rsquo;s another type of cleansing that is going to occur now from your inward nature. But that is not obvious at the moment, only when this teacher and the student has set up a bond, then this exchange occurs. Within 24 hours a day seven days a week or any moment, you can feel a sort of a flushing system occurring in you and you really know something is going on from a very subtle level. You may not understand it in the early stages but if you stick with it and that&rsquo;s what blessedness can be now, a sort of persistency, the whole mechanism starts to clean itself, it is becoming blissful, it&rsquo;s becoming purified. And it&rsquo;s not imagination, it&rsquo;s measurable, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so fantastic about this process. We&rsquo;re fortunate to be living in a technological society where the brain is not accepting hearsay like we did centuries ago. We&rsquo;re testing, trying to validate, and though we may seem to be squandering, we have to hurt ourselves first before we improve, that&rsquo;s one of the beauties of this part of the world. The other part of the world you can be very restricted and avoid the test or you don&rsquo;t want to get too deep into the measurements, that&rsquo;s not healthy either. We need to measure, we need to validate, and not stumble blindly into it. The gradual physical changes in the body can be experienced, can be measured to indicate you are making spiritual changes in your nature. Now &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&rdquo; Most of us are over programmed with this word &ldquo;poor,&rdquo; that we remain poor all our lives. It&rsquo;s not intended that you should be poor because even Jesus at a later date says &ldquo;the poor you&rsquo;ll always have, me not all the time&rdquo; you see? So it&rsquo;s not that type of a poverty they&rsquo;re talking about, but we can program ourselves to that type of understanding of the word &ldquo;poor&rdquo; and feel very depressed. &ldquo;Why me Lord, why me&rdquo; and never really understand what he is involving us in. Some of us have thought that the word &ldquo;poor&rdquo; means to be humble. When they say &ldquo;poor in spirit, they mean humble in spirit,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s not 100% true either when it comes to the teacher and the student. It is all right for the general public to interpret it that way and may get ready for the actual interaction with the living teacher or someone who is realized. But the actual thing that is occurring in &ldquo;poor in spirit&rdquo; is you don&rsquo;t know when the teacher will come into your life. If you did know then you&rsquo;re rich in spirit and you don&rsquo;t really need a teacher and so he said &ldquo;blessed are the poor in spirit,&rdquo; blessed are those who attune themselves and wait for the moment when this influx of spirituality will come into their life, preparing them. The more you wait and let it come, it begins to manifest in your life. Now in the Eastern tradition they say &ldquo;When the student is ready, the Master is there.&rdquo; Well how can he be ready if he&rsquo;s rich in spirit? He has to be ready only when he&rsquo;s poor in spirit but that poor in spirit don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s suffering from lack of, it is that a sense of readiness has been reached where the timing of the teacher and the student are going to lock into each other and the exchange of realization and the switching on of the two individuals will bond. For example, at the River Jordan there lived a man whose name was John and he performed a ceremony called baptism by using water and many people came to be baptized by him. Yet the man John said &ldquo;I baptize you by water but there comes one who will baptize you by Spirit&rdquo; and that even that one, he&rsquo;s not worthy enough to untie that person&rsquo;s shoe and he kept telling the people that all the time. Then later on another man came and the moment he arrived on the scene, he looked all around and he said &ldquo;There is no man born of woman greater than John who is Elijah that has come.&rdquo; But how can this person suddenly arrive on the scene, look at this individual performing his work, and openly declare what he thinks this person is unless there is some connectedness, some exchange occurring between the two of them. Then he walks up to John and he says &ldquo;Baptize me.&rdquo; Well John looks at him and he says &ldquo;No, you baptize me.&rdquo; Well picture for one moment two grown-up fellows arguing who should throw a little water on other&rsquo;s head? (Laughter). It all sounds as if it&rsquo;s in-depth yet but in preference of the relationship, John condescends and baptizes the stranger and he was Jesus. And lo and behold John saw a dove descending and heard the voice saying &ldquo;This is my beloved son in whom I&rsquo;m well pleased.&rdquo; An exchange, an interconnectedness occurred.</p>

<p>Adano86_03_28_3LivingtoLiveQ2NW3 - 0:13 All around us, we think we are seeing living people, but really, 99% of the time, people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they are 60 years of age and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically, but if they are living to live, they have this tremendous power available to them to be in the world yet not of the whirl, to be seen and not to be seen. 0:40 The most important thing in this journey of now, since it is not going anyplace, it’s called the Journey of Now. NOW. And it sounds like a journey which implies going someplace, but you’re not going anyplace. It’s a journey of coping, more than going. It’s a big difference between looking at it as a journey of going someplace, from one place to another place. It’s occurring in Now. A journey of coping in the Now and since Now and coping are all contained by the Creative Me, that’s why Moses had to confront it, “there is no god before Me,” and don’t have no graven image. Don’t look for any object outside of yourself that’s going to represent me. Me is already locked up here. 0:51 I’ll give you an example of an illusion and the actual truth. There was a priest who lived in a town and a big rain came and it started to flood the area. So the priest began to pray to God to stop the rain. Got out there, praying, and the water came up to his knee and all the parishishioners in the town saw him there praying and they came along with the boat and said, “Father, please save yourself. Come on, get in this boat and let’s go to the highland for refuge.” And he says, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go save anyone you find that needs help, take them to safety.” He kept on praying and the water got up to his chest. By that time a second boat came along and the people said, “Oh Father, please save yourself.” He said, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go and find people that you can save and take them to the higher ground.” They went off. By that time the water got as high as his nose now. Along came a helicopter with a ladder and said, “Hey Father, please save yourself, grab the ladder, the place is all flooded.” And he shouted, “No, no, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go ahead and try and save anyone that you can take them to higher ground. I am praying to God to stop the rain.” Finally, the water is over his head and he is standing before God and he says, “How come I’m here? I thought you would stop the rain?” And God said, “Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more do you want?” You see what belief can do in that fixated state versus when the practical is all around you for you to function. And that’s the problem is happening to many of us today, that we get so over fixated in the belief and when the practical thing is there, we miss the truth. Not that a miracle cannot happen to pray for the rain to stop, with God anything is possible, but I don’t think God is constantly manufacturing miracles because somebody get down on his knees and prays for it. When all the other varieties of ways for man’s survival and continuance is available to him. He’s just got to open his consciousness and recognize the many other opportunities that are there for his survival. This is what we are calling “Living to Live” instead of living to die. Living to die is a fixated state. Living to live is not. All the great men who have come down throughout the centuries all came to teach us to live to live. FROM MARJORIE MORGAN NOTES: Yes it is very auspicious tonight the whole week has been so miraculous, so unusual, (Easter week). On the way down here I was looking for a present for my associate in Texas, trying to get a birthday present for the person. I coudn&rsquo;t decide what to buy the person. We stopped at different places and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re coming along outside Gila Bend, I said to my friend who was driving, &ldquo;stop the van, stop right here, your going to get gas.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;no, the gas station if further down.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;no, the gas station is right here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop, stop,,&rdquo; and he pulled over to the side of the road and there is the gas station. I don&rsquo;t know if you know the place. It is called Cosmo Gas Station and Cosmo Restaurant. It&rsquo;s right on the way to Tucson. We go into the place to buy gas, and the owner had a little store on the side. I saw the present. It was a brass crucifix and I picked it up and somehow it didn&rsquo;t ring a bell completely. It was ideal yet it didn&rsquo;t fit; and I said &ldquo;well tomorrow is the crucifiction (Good Friday,) there is something wrong. I turned around and on the shelf behind me is a little dish-plate with the last supper painted into it. I said &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and when I reached for it I could feel the vibration , and the price was so appropiate. The owner started to laugh. We were getting something so beautiful for almost peanuts. But the person whom the present was for would appreciate having it and discovering it on a day like yesterday. That was so amazing about it. Now tonight we are discussing one of the most unusual moments in life-on Good Friday-that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about. Is it realy the crucifixon or the sorrow of death? Or is it something that leads to the triumph of what are we all living here for? Society is geared to live to die and it&rsquo;s not an ideal process. It&rsquo;s creating sickness. But you&rsquo;re got to live a certain amount of years to prepare to retire, to phase off, and be placed in the soil ,and to look for some nebulous region in the heavens, and you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually there. Then you can go along through life with tremondous conviction-it&rsquo;s there. But the real test is when you lay down and die. And then here we celebrate and remember a life that is lived on the planet and that is gone. Yet the challenge is not today. The challenge is the day after tomorrow. What happens? The triumph of death. But it&rsquo;s not so much the triumph of death&ndash; that is what you are looking for; what we are looking for is how to live to live and not live to die. All through the centuries man has lived to die and took out his vengence on his fellow man in order to eliminate it so you won&rsquo;t have to face it. And then here comes along an incident where the man Jesus raised another person from the grave showing that living to die isn&rsquo;t really the goal of life. Why raise another dead man from the grave if living to die, to find God is the true purpose? But living to live, to encounter God, is now in your immediate life, is the real challenge and the real experience. Yogananda use to say everything else can wait but the search for God cannot because it&rsquo;s a conscious now experience, not something nebulous and far beyond time. If you can&rsquo;t encounter it now in the waking state and really have the understanding and assurance of how it relates, you don&rsquo;t have anything. If you&rsquo;re all lying down dead in this room and God walks in and says &ldquo;Hi folks. What do you want,; your breath back, the power to perform miracles, or some possessions to make you the wealthiest people in the world?&rdquo; What would you choose? You sure would want your breath back! It doesn&rsquo;t look like much. It doesn&quot;t sound like much-right-compared to performing miracles and having possessions, yet you cannot perform miracles if you don&rsquo;t breathe. And you can&rsquo;t own anything if you don&rsquo;t breathe either. Is it in death or is it in life? When you understand where the real encounter is then you understand why Jesus said &ldquo;My God is a God of the living, not of the dead.&rdquo; Meaning, living to die has no assurance but it&rsquo;s the ideal way to function. But living to live is ideal. It&rsquo;s ideal because it guarantees it&rsquo;s own self, it assures it&rsquo;s own self. The resurrection is an indication of a guarantee. But more than that the principal is in nature. The butterfly is a model of it. The butterfly came before man because his environment was created for him to live in. Man-if you make man before you make his environment where would you put him? But you have to make the environment first in order to function in it as a man, male and female. But then you can&rsquo;t have someone in the sky constantly directing you. It won&rsquo;t make any sense. You have to place the laws of nature around you to allow you to discover by trial and error. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so beautiful about it; that each one of us is carrying his own cross and not the other person&rsquo;s cross. &ldquo;Pick up your cross and follow me.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t pick up mine. He picked up His today. Each one of us is carrying his own particular confrontation with life, not living to die in the confrontation,but living to live in the now, each one of us. Wherever you are, whatever your doing, that&rsquo;s the moment of confrontation. And it&rsquo;s the moment of living to live. So by leaving a butterfly as a model - the butterfly is a caterpillar - a worm - eats his way through life, spins a cocoon which you call a shroud, and emerges a different creature. Of all the creatures that can fly there&rsquo;s none more beautiful than a butterfly. And I have deliberately squashed up caterpillars and checked them to see how they rot, and squashed up butterflies, and compared them. And I&rsquo; never found a rotten butterfly but I&rsquo;ve found rotten caterpillars, telling me without doubt that life is for living and not to run from it. And it&rsquo;s in that process when I look at the caterpillar I realized its tissue and I looked at my own body and its tissue. I am made of the same model. But I have one advantage over that caterpillar. I can muck-up my opportunity with my mouth; but he doesn&rsquo;t have to, he eats his way and becomes a butterfly. But I can make all kinds of mistakes with my words. Whatever I say to myself I get sick or I get healthy. The caterpillar doesn&rsquo;t do that to itself so that&rsquo;s my disadvantage and my advantage, how to regulate my spoken word to warrant the result of the process which is eternal body or non-decomposing bodies; or take it with you and you pass on into another realm. Now its not in the imagination. It&rsquo;s a natural face. We are already designed for it but our spoken word prevents us from experiencing it. When you say we are living to live we can leave the body as a testimony of a non-decomposing organism. That would defy the thinking individual. Or you can leave then an empty coffin and wonder where we went like Brother Jesus did. He left us an empty hole in the wall. And he&rsquo;s gone, but is He invisible or has He gone? That is the question. He hasn&rsquo;t gone. But He is visible and indivisible at command performances; meaning, He is here with us. We have to make the attempt to want to see the living in the living and not the living in the dead. All around us we think we are seeing living people. But really 99% of the time people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they reach 60 years of age, and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically. They are just occupying space chemically. But if they are living to live they have this tremendous power available to them - to be in the world and not of the world. To be seen and not to be seen. Now is may seem farfeched but it&rsquo;s not. There is a book called &ldquo;The Incorruptables.&rdquo; There are over 300 case histories. I&rsquo;ll put it this way: one case history for each day of the month or the year. And 80% of the case histories are women of non-decomposing bodies on record. So you see it has nothing to do because who lives to die most of the time in all modern society? Did you ever hear a woman say she&rsquo;s living to retire? We always hear the best is what? He&rsquo;s working hard to retire - right? All a woman says is that she is tying to hang in there. We have to change our programing. We had better had because it&rsquo;s not practical and it&rsquo;s producing more sickness. Resurrection is not a far-fetched process. Every religion has its evidence,. But more so, people who don&rsquo;t belong to no religion, who mainly realize by virtue of trial and error, by the process of being practical moment to moment, are arriving in that state. Churchianity has nothing to do with the realization of God. Realization of God is a personal interaction of life. You are the living temple of God. You are the living church. It&rsquo;s not some building like this that you go to on a Sunday. If God were to rest what would happen to us? We&rsquo;d be in a bad place. He can&rsquo;t turn off this equipment called the universe. He has to be everywhere. So he is his own devil! By playing His own devil he tests His own creation. But we never ask about it that way. Once we begin to realize and live in it we begin to realize that God is and always will be. Not a person sitting on a throne. A principal that has become the universe locked up in man to talk back to himself. That&rsquo;s the funny part of it. Of all the creatures in the world to worship God, they know in the 80&rsquo;s. Man endowed with individuality to talk to himself. See, He has to convince Himself and that&rsquo;s the uniqueness of it. By becoming His creation and taking the roll of man which is flesh and setting up individuality in order to give it a sense of uniqueness. The individuality is the process of which the creator talks back to Himself. Now, when you are awake and you are looking at me right now you have individuality and you feel different. You may accept what I say or reject it because you&rsquo;re awake and you are hearing me talking to you in English and you&rsquo;re using your memory training because you are programed to English; therefore you comprehend what I am saying. I look Oriental so if I spoke to you: you would not understand what the hell I was saying to you, (laughter,) right? So there you go. What the hell is that guy talking about? You see, our words suddenly lose their sense of value, and their individuality has a problem. Now all of us go to sleep at night. When you are sound asleep do you know if you are a man or a woman, no matter if you spoke Chinese, English or French? You see? But God, He isn&rsquo;t going any place. He is still holding us together, allowing us to breathe; and if you don&rsquo;t wake up, it&rsquo;s over. That&rsquo;s facts that you have got to live with every day. From the dawn of creation when we knew the universe began, to when it ends - midnight eternity. That&rsquo;s a long time. So He is not going out of business, but he is providing a unique process by which His individualized manifestations can be permanent, and not resolve itself into a unified field. He wants us to be permanent by giving us individuality, by allowing us to experience trial and error to discover living to die or living to live. And living to live is &ldquo;To he who overcometh I will not send forth a second time but will make him a pillar in the house of the Lord&rdquo;, incorruptable. Or the option of that is to appear and disappear at will, still not corruptable. See what I mean? Look what you got when you begin to realize it. Your best friend, (Adano kisses His own hand here,) self love, not nartistic, cosmic. No greater love than he who would lay down his cells for his fellow man, but greater love is he who can recognize the God in himself. That&rsquo;s the greater love because I can&rsquo;t love you like myself. I can only love you as myself. There is a vast difference. See. &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of thy mind not part of the mind. So you can&rsquo;t sleep you know,. You can&rsquo;t die, that&rsquo;s the end of the mind, but that&rsquo;s no all. If you&rsquo;re going to love Him you&rsquo;re going to do what? Be alive, awake, alert and enthusiastic, and,with all your heart. It&rsquo;s got to be counted conscious now, all your strength. The respiratory rate has got to be involved, and soul. That&rsquo;s your individuality. You are soul. If you have soul it&rsquo;s preposterous to ask the body to save it. But because you&rsquo;re an individualist in the creative process, you can use your individualism to exalt your reality and bring out the soul- ness of it which is God in you. Make it a permanent principal. If you have soul it is preposterous to ask the body to save it, but because you are an individualist in the creative process you can use your individualism to exalt your reality and bring out the soul-ness of it which is God in you. Make it a permanent principal. &quot; To him that overcometh&rdquo; - overcometh this flux - you won&rsquo;t have to do it a second time. We may be at a hundred million second time right now waiting to make the transition , but in making a pillar a pillar is a structure of something that doesn&rsquo;t change in the house of the Lord, in this whole creative process. So the only way we could become permanent would be like the butterfly emerging out of the caterpillar - the incorruptible. As we achieve this incorruptible state we have the individualism still locked up in us to go back and forth in the universe being visible and invisible on command performance. For that reason early man created his communication by saying &ldquo;I believe in the communion with the saints.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a vast difference to say I believe in the communion with spirits. The saint was once a living human being who went through the transition of going from the visible to the invisible, and from breakdown to non-breakdown. Therefor he has no hangups and he has no games to play. He&rsquo;s not here to take advantage of you or try to get you into God. He is here to remind you that you have God in you. The psychic may not. Ge can be carried away. He is the moth that flies to the light and gets burned up. The butterfly is different. It doesn&rsquo;t fly to the light to get burned uyp. It emerges out of the caterpillar by the process of , gradual anguish, of eating it&rsquo;s way and comes out a beautiful creature that can fly. That&rsquo;s the transition of the true person. That is the path that the great man Jesus come to show. His life is that model in human form taken from the cosmic law laid up in the caterpillar to the butterfly. All the great souls that demonstrate this are his brothers and sisters because the Christ principal is locked up in you already. That is why he said in simple language &quot; the things I do you can do also, but not greater than me&rdquo; - right or wrong? I know it is wrong because if he said that , then I say &ldquo;right brotherJesus, you are the only one and true son of God. I&rsquo;d throw myself down here because you are number one and will always be number one. But he never said that. He said &ldquo;the things I do you can do and greater things shall you do. &quot; It means the option to be free is locked up in you, if you grasp it and apply it. Because he grasped it within himself and applied it, he grasped the greater quality, the greater power locked up in himself. Now we have to grasp it. When it is put into simple language it simply means we have to grasp the desire to live to live and not live to die. Living to die is not the Christ state. The Christ state that will offer you death and it dies in itself cannot be a Christ state. It has to offer you life and remain as a living principal in itself. If God is life and God is in everything and endows you and I with individuality to experience to see if you are willing to take a chance with your individuality at the conscious level. Unconsciously when you are sound asleep you won&rsquo;t know. That happens to you from the time you are born, your conscious,and you, must go through your life-part of it- unconscious; and you may go through your whole life with that portion of unconscious, never happening, never finding out what really occurs, what really happens in that period of your life. Who are you? What are you doing there? What am I believing or what am I actually trying to experience? A vast difference -what I believe versus what I actually am-are two different things-like night and day. I can believe in a lot of things; but it can turn out I may be wrong. Then I&rsquo;m destroyed with my delusion. What I actually am is not going to fool me because that is exactly what I&rsquo;ll always be. Now I am atomic energy ! I&rsquo;m not going any place! Ancient man called it spirit. Modern man calls it cosmic force. Whatever you want to call it, it&rsquo;s not going any place. It is. Like it or not. When Jesus said &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father,&rdquo; you see this body, you see the cosmic principal. &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; This individuality and this principal are one in the same thing. We aren&rsquo;t going any place. You are stuck with it. Two things equal to the same thing are equal to what? Newton&rsquo;s law-one another. You and I -yes-are one in the same; but at different levels os expression called individuality. The realization is your moment to moment encounter. I&rsquo;m not here to mold you into anything, I am here to find who I am. You are here to find out who you are. But we could be locked into a long time arguing as to how you will mold each other, and hate each other; and yet when we fall asleep at night all the molding is over (laugh,) and all the hatred is over and if we never wake up what did we learn? Nothing, because we are back right where we started to find out what we are when we are sound asleep. You see, that&rsquo;s why Paul quit trying to go around converting people. Do you know why he quit? It was when he realized he couldn&rsquo;t control his internal life. He said, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing.&rdquo; Meaning: You can go around rejoicing in your converting these Jewish people to become Christians. I quit because I live and die daily in the Lord right now. I don&rsquo;t know of any other process that I have found out that this is where it is at - not trying to con- vert. You can&rsquo;t make a rose into a daisy. A rose is a rose and a daisy is a daisy. Both have to get inside. I have to intergrade too. At the process of breathing we come into this world and we cut the cord. If we breathe on time they keep us. If we don&rsquo;t breathe on time they bury us. Then we start all over again. You are lucky if you think of it: you made thirty years, forty years, sixty years. You are lucky because, consider all the belief systems that proceeded you before you got to this point- where you are ready to accept yourself for who and what you are. You are more concerned now, not what you believe, # and it&rsquo;s derogatory conditions to discard it. It&rsquo;s no loss. It&rsquo;s what you actually are now-what you are to yourself. That is what you have to go through. So once you accept that you and the Father are one, the comedy of it is that it makes life much more simple. The simplicity of it is that your loving your enemy for the first time for what they actually are. If you haven&rsquo;t got any more enemies, whose your enemy now? The belief systems are your enemy now not another person. So you realize what is yourself. You revitalize yourself and you begin to live. How many people in the audience here have read &ldquo;Autobiography of A Yogi&rdquo;? When Yogananda&rsquo;s teacher was suppose to have died Yogananda was torn up as any other person would be as a human being; yet when his teacher comes back and greets him Yogananda thinks it is an apparition and Yogananda rushes up to meet the teacher and hugs him. The teacher says &ldquo;hey man let go, you&rsquo;ll squeeze the hell out of me.&rdquo; (Laughter). This hurts you know. like Thomas reaching out to Jesus. Gosh fellow, make sure. And Jesus comes through the door and eats with the disciples. These are the things that make people realize what the atomic principal is. We have had a lot of sudo experiences , but the general experiences are always genuine. That is why your churches decided to set up a difference between the psychic experience and the actual spiritual experience. The prayer &ldquo;I believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; means the correction of my own misapplied decisions. There are no sins to fear in this world but misapplied decisions. I have to accept that I must make decisions. I can make correct ones or incorrect ones. I have to live out the correct ones as well as the incorrect ones. Assuming the responsibility to correct them is my cross or, like you say, my burden, not yours. All realized people begin to realize it in the end; and once they accept the actuality of it they are living to live, therefore there is no sin. There is just trial and error in learning. You are learning by error, you see. You make a mistake to compare, not to make it again. To have life without mistakes you would not know where to go; but to have life in order to make mistakes you have something to compare now to move it. So when they say &ldquo;forgiveness of sins&quot;meaning we give ourselves more time to correct our self-made incorrect decisions that we have lived we have to correct it ourselves. The saint is the same. Saint - a Latin word meaning sane. He&rsquo;s not trying to run your life. He at least has discovered how to live in a sane way by living to live, and the model is that they are there. They don&rsquo;t impose since thy are cosmic nursemaids. (Laughter.) You know, you hire a nursemaid to take care of the children while you go to work. Basically, when we realize ourselves what job do we have? We are all working for &ldquo;big Daddy.&rdquo; So who is down here undeveloped? Your brother and sister is another form of you Who is down here locked up in individualized states? It is the same God because it is life flowing in and out, and the interesting phenomenon is this: do you think the amount of life force that is inside of you is any different from the quantity in my body or anyone else in this room? They have tested this already. The amount is exactly three ounces. From the time they cut the cord you weigh exactly three ounces more after the cord is cut. When you finally quit breathing you weigh exactly three ounces less. So that three ounces of food belongs to? It&rsquo;s God in His creative nature playing roles of individuality. We are stuck in our big fat ego thinking we are going to hold on. We can&rsquo;t hold on to the wrong program of living to die. The ego is no assert there. In living to live we can be blessed to have the reward of keeping that process in the mechanism that no longer breaks down. The very same oxygen that keeps us going in living to die suddenly becomes an asset in living to live. Now if Jesus and all these great men didn&rsquo;t come to teach us to live to live we would not be celebrating the next two days, (Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday,) because that is the evidence we have. It is the next two days, how we accept these laws and look at it, what is open to us. Two thousand years ago we could not comprehend how to handle it. We are only fourteen years from the year two thousand. We have all the equipment around us to validate, but man is eternal if he learns to live to live. But if he learns to live to die, he has to repeat the process over and over; but since this is not a mass exodus to God realization at the very individualist process, each one has his own cross to carry. I can&rsquo;t carry yours, but whoever arrives at that process and is established, becomes a cosmic nursemaid. (A Guru.) See-because what other love can we be applying once we arrive. We can only apply the love of inspiration, the love of confidence, the love of assurance, the love of guarantee to the individual who is struggling to work through their own individuality to the one reality. So it is like a a jigsaw puzzle and realization is like the turn style. We always slip out one at a time. (Laughter) So what do we have in our consciousness to work with? The most important thing is this journey of now, see, it is not going any place. It is called the journey of now, inward; and it sounds like a journey of going some place,, but you are not going any place. It is a journey of coping more than going. It is a big difference between looking at a place. It is a current in now, a journey of coping in the now. And since now and coping are all contained by the creative me, that is why Moses had to confront it: &ldquo;There is no God before me&rdquo; and &ldquo;do not have any graven image,&rdquo; Do not look for any image outside of yourself that is going to represent me. Me is already locked up there. You only can point to this one, me (yourself.) Me flowers, me leaf, me table. You don&rsquo;t like it? That is too bad! He will always be a flower to Himself; so I have got to come to the realization the me, God, is here already. Moses would look inside and say the burning bush is the light inside of your head. Who are you? I am that I am. Well, how can any object identify itself without using the words I am? I am God. I am a bird. I am a potato. I am Adano. I am lucky. I am. All the I AMs make it what? One big I am. You see? Even Jesus said &ldquo;I and the Father are one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; These men understood the reality of living to live and broke away from the illusion of living to die. And that is what you call the ignorance of ignorance. There is no sin. It is just ignoring and misapplying your decisions to your commitment; yet you have to come back to correct it. That is what is so beautiful about the process. If you are a teacher and you had a student that took and examination and he did not pass would you put him in the next class, or would you send him back to do it all over again? Right? So this is basically the fundamental unity that underlines all individual forms. At the individual level we have to confront our nature by trial and error. We may make mistakes, wrong decisions and we can&quot;t expect to go any further in understanding if we don&rsquo;t correct it because it will come back to confront us. The sooner you realize it the quicker you get healthy because-why? You don&rsquo;t feel as vulnerable any more. You don&rsquo;t feel trapped any more. That is why Jesus said confess your sins before your fellow man. Confront your mistakes before others. Re-evalute it and get on the ball with what? Living now! It is easy to resolve the anguish by talking then by holding it and trying to withdraw to avoid it. That is living to die. More and more as we become conscious of what we are we automatically face ourselves and internal healing begins because healing is already locked up in us. It is denied us when we live to die because we have already shut it out with some kind of a notion that we are going some place to get it, and when we do get there, it is not there; but if we accept it here in the now and it is locked up in the creative me and the individually I</p>

<p>Adano88_03_08FlagstaffQ1NW5 -</p>
<p>Adano88_03_26_1SatsangQ1NW5 - 2:11 I&rsquo;ll put it this way, all the knowledge that has come down to us if we were to apply it in our simple way, day to day, these words could be your greatest measuring stick for living in the carbon based body, &ldquo;I accept the communication of the Saint.&rdquo; But Their communication has nothing to do with channeling. Their communication is actual manifestation of Themselves for you to check&rsquo;em out because They&rsquo;re your brothers and your sisters so They can&rsquo;t play games in your head. Therefore I accept that type of relationship. The next statement is &ldquo;there are no sins to forgive, but misapplied decisions.&rdquo; I accept responsibility to correct my own misapplied decisions no matter where I did them, I accept that responsibility to correct it and if you ask God, &ldquo;Is there a sin?&rdquo; He may say, &ldquo;Yeah, when you don&rsquo;t look at Me.&rdquo; Now who is Me? Yourself, you see? So that&rsquo;s why Jesus put in a nice way by saying, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of your mind. You can&rsquo;t do it with part of your mind, so it gotta be all of your mind so Me is involved in the all and with all of your heart, all of your strength, all of your breath, and your neighbor as yourself. Everything is, but that&rsquo;s the understanding that brings you to the&hellip; that you will resolve all the misapplied decisions that were done and correct them. 2:13 So that&rsquo;s valid, God will clean up His own act via the individuality. Individuality triggered it, individuality can clean it up and resolve it in the unified field, that&rsquo;s your true self. And last but not least, the atom is eternal, I am made from the atoms. I am 144 elements. I ain&rsquo;t going no place because who am I? I and the Father are one? Two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another? Am I immortal or am I just a figment of my imagination? Audience: Immortal. Adano: Good, then if I&rsquo;m immortal, then you make the declaration, &ldquo;I will do the cleanup, or the dirty work, because I trigger it off myself through my individuality as an opportunity to experience differential relationship &rsquo;till midnight eternity. In other words God, creating His universe out of a unified field, has to impress back upon His nature the highest integrity of individuality of assuming responsibility for the role as an individual. It&rsquo;s what you call Superman emerging out of Clark Kent (laughing from Adano and the audience). The maturity of the super being out of the individual. The quality that&rsquo;s inside of you that must emerge for, what you say, assuming responsibility for being you. Not afraid of it, not running from it. That&rsquo;s in essence what we are saying and it is there that They&rsquo;re trying to teach us and we&rsquo;ll constantly be reminded by it in all the different meditational groups. We&rsquo;ll have it more and more, seeing it everyday.</p>

<p>Adano88_03_28TucsonSatsangQ1NW3 - 00:22 So the person who is realized, he isn&rsquo;t wiser, or better than. That isn&rsquo;t what the word realized means, or implies. It is a person who has come to accept that each moment is unrehearsed, each moment is unique, and each moment is all they have. So some wise man wrote a long time ago, &ldquo;after looking through my life, I come to realize that I have to live every moment of my life from now on as if it were my last moment.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way he summed it up. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have any moment to look forward to or look back on. There is no way I can pick up yesterday or tomorrow. It is a respiratory principle and worrying about others wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. What we can do for others is keep the thought of a cooperativeness which you yourself would feel in your present time frame as you cooperate with your timeframe. This particular condition will go out to help others to sense this cooperativeness and it gets stronger in them and they begin to cope with situations instead of panic. More important is that you accept that there are moments in your life that you will be threatened with situations that you aren&rsquo;t prepared for, you&rsquo;ll feel competent or incompetent, but until it happens or you have to live it, what would you do, worry about it?

<p>Adano89_09_25TucsonQ3NW3 - Cusp of Aquar. cycle 200 yrs - compensation, initiate takes over investiture, can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re right, must know, breath free - breathless lungs, Sonics, diamond body, understanding gives you control over investiture, understanding has no ATG, is driver - not a passenger. Verbal rain, no goals - process, master unconsciousness then you&rsquo;re free, breathing can switch - RNA - DNA, what is bliss, breathfree, breath less, sleep, wakefulness &amp; death, Ed tells story of seance, must learn breathless state, let go of geometry, let go of past, what is present, living the now. Looks can be changed instantly, relive journey of sperm to ovum, moving electrons, rebirthing - got to meditate!, Ovum #149 calling sperm #149, 4 of June - story of Swami Ananda &amp; story of him being made Swami, G.U.R.U., skin knows how to breath, &ldquo;investiture&rdquo; &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; &ldquo;be here now&rdquo; 2:10 See there is no commandment, thou shalt not lie, because the whole universe is a what? an illusion, optical illusion or Maya or relativity, centered upon acceleration, elements playing this particular process of holding things together in a geometrical shape by resonance, that’s the spoken word. Your own spoken word holds up the geometry and your own spoken word separates the geometry. So if you’re going to be honest with your cells, you have to make the commitment and finish it by doing it and just don’t say it and don’t do it because they’ll pull you out from underneath and let you face your own dirt. See? So that is why placebo works. The scientist doesn’t like it, but it’s a preparation for the acceptance of commitment&hellip; Thank you. Well I guess we gotta hit the road. I love you folks&hellip;</p>
<p>Adano00_1AdanoQ4NW4 - Misc topics. Mantra means spiritual aid, designed to help you understand yourself. Psalms are laid out to show us an ethical way to live. Harassment is like a picador (bullfight) and well wishers in a family are like picadors. Meditation disciplines: focusing the eyes (pick a point / focus without blinking), art of breathing (I and my Father are One is a breathing technique), art of hearing (demonstration of Hong So technique from Yogananda), discipline of feeling (left thumb on right wrist and locate pulse, built in rosary / metronome). Story of Indian Chief and Minister from Assembly of God church, Chief is just wearing a blanket. Minister says &ldquo;Chief, don&rsquo;t you feel cold?&rdquo; Chief says &ldquo;tell me friend, do you cover your face in the wintertime?&rdquo; Chief pulls aside blanket and he is naked and says &ldquo;Me all face.&rdquo; That was a prayer technique that Adano learned. Story about a student (later the Swami that initiated Adano) who did not think he was making progress. His teacher asked him &ldquo;How long can you sit down and meditate without getting restless.&rdquo; The teacher and student meditated and at the end of one hour, the teacher nailed the student calf to the floor with an old rusty nail. Then healed the student saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the scar so you will know how far you are in god.&rdquo; Master Jesus was not suffering on the cross either. The most difficult part of the discipline is feeling. Body getting stiff during meditation is feeling diminishing in certain areas, but the mind is craving sensation. So it sets up an alarm system and end of meditation.</p>
<p>Adano00_01FromEdQ4NW1 - Not eating. Weight gain / loss. 10 36 radicals. Diseases are placebo. If you label it, you got it. Yes, no, and maybe of what is actually involved. The pineal gland is a lens that provides convex vision. 20 Getting the real understanding 30 Pickup your own cross and follow me. Love the Lord with all your mind, strength, and soul. And your neighbor as yourself that&rsquo;s the key to immortality. Butterfly eats his way to butterfly-hood. Psychophysical synchronicity, a spiritual person is a practical person, moment to moment action represents immunity, disengagement of unity, free love w/o coercion, surrender timing to consciousness, can you act what you say, convex vision, karmic or spermal.</p>
<p>Adano00_1SolarQ4NW7 - Acid / alkaline nitrazine paper. Meal is comprised of protein, carbohydrate, mineral / vitamin, lipid or oil, liquid or water. 10 Animal flesh doesn&rsquo;t have nitrogen. 20 Almonds have nitrogen and all 12 basic minerals. 30 Animals go over animals that are not healthy. 40 Adrenaline and uric acid in meat attacks liver, pancreas. 50 Spirulina is built to raise the enervation level. Take it at night if from Mexico. Afternoon if from the US. 1:00 Almonds set the hydrochloric acid, eat them first. 1:10 Morning, afternoon, evening timings. Boiled oranges.</p>
<p>Adano00_02FromEdQ4NW1 - You are your own heaven and hell with your tongue. Love backward is evol-ving. You got all eternity to evolve. Ever new love, ever new joy or you would get bored with it. Come in sperm 162. 10 Spermal confrontations. 20 Living in the now is the liberation from the conditions imposed by the planetary system. Saturn is Greek for Chronos, Father time. 30 The Law of Miracles in Autobiography of a Yogi is the Unified Field. 40 Creative Intelligence is playing a fantastic game and gambling on it, but the creation cannot win, it can only surrender to it. &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s banking that Man will play every game to avoid giving unconditional love. 50 Cold war and whose language will setup the behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Adano00_2SolarQ4NW7 - The challenge for the mechanism is to work your way through. You can live / function minus the meat, but some blood types crave it: A and AB even though they are designed to not be meat eaters. They are designed to eat grain that has acid that doesn&rsquo;t affect them. However, they crave the experience of acid from meat. Type B and O craves to be a non-meat eater. 10 Story about man with amoebic dysentery. A little Sake helped it. 20 Sake is made from grass. Rice is a neutral food. 1 lb wild rice, 3 lbs of brown rice combined is the ultimate form of protein. Can be used in place of almonds. Short grain is a little more acid than long grain. Mucus can be caused by having grains at the wrong time (morning). Gas, mucus, and hardening of the tissues are signs of food out of time cycle. 30 We are at the mercy of nature if we don&rsquo;t have a stability backup like an anchor being carried by a boat which is only used during storms. Nighttime foods. 40 Vitamin C from nightshade plants like tomatoes and bell pepper. The tomato is a fruto-vegetable, a cross between the two. It behaves like a  bat, it flies and has no wings with a face like a rat. It hunts at night in the dark. Tomato climbs like a vine, but behaves like a fruit and has vitamin C that doesn&rsquo;t break down with heat. Don&rsquo;t crack fingers sideways. 50 Seaweed is for gonad and uterine canal plus eggs and fish for reproductive organs. Oysters for horniness. Iodine / seaweed for regenerative organs. Vitamins phase out in alcohol so nature has made the maguey plant (cactus) in the bromeliad family. The leaves are like the public hair. Genital problems that are toxic are solved by vitamin C. Herpes is a drastic problem with lack of vitamin C. Maguey plant (tequila) is good for this. 1:00 Story about man running race drinking apple juice, then orange juice when finished. Excellent results. 1:10 Different racial groups have different time to phase out cow dairy products (latest is around 21). Goat milk is alkaline in reaction. 1:20 Explanation of times for different foods. Most heart attacks happen after lunch from out of time eating. Giving them oxygen helps them at this time.</p>
<p>Adano00_3SolarQ4NW7 - Medicinal dose of alcohol is a teaspoon. Smells of apples in relationship to ripeness. 10 Farmers picking fruit at the range of malic acid smelling like ammonia to prevent worms from eating them. Light affects the odor of plants. Alcohol from potatoes, beets, etc. 20 The organs have to be fed and cleaned in each time cycle through fruit in each light cycle. Morning cleansing is the best time through fruits and nuts. Afternoon heavy meal and cleaning with grapes, melons, berries, and evening semi-heavy meal and pineapple. Daylight savings time is for economics. 30 Checking timing of the body at 3 AM. Environment is God and you are God. If the two aren&rsquo;t synchronized, then there is discordance. 3 AM = right nostril. 40 Story about Sonny biting into a hamburger with a toothpick and having to go to the hospital instead of going to the front lines of the war. Adano recommended that Sonny create pains in his body because he was too pure and was losing his immunity to pain. Sonny got sick one day and started losing weight. The doctor&rsquo;s scared him and he went on a long fast to clean up his body. Adano recommended again that he get some pain in his body, but Sonny went ahead with the fast. He called Adano to meet him at 6 PM. When Adano got there, Sonny had killed himself and left a note for Adano that said: &ldquo;I refuse to suffer.&rdquo; Adano went and got a bottle of rum in honor of his father who forced Adano to drink to cure him of his toxicity. He never got rum after that until Sonny&rsquo;s death. 50 Adano born during gallbladder time so he thrives on foods in the middle of the day (and he had his gallbladder removed). Adano got on the path when he was living in Canada in 1945. He looked for a 100 books on God. He was broke at the time and realized he wasn&rsquo;t being practical to survive. He had only $3. He was looking at a photo of Yogananda and turned over on his bed and locked the shutters. Just about midnight to 1 AM, he saw what looked like a firefly that moved. It got bigger and kept moving until it went to Yogananda&rsquo;s picture. Only the eyes of the photo were talking to him. The eyes were saying &ldquo;none come unto the Father, but by me.&rdquo; The next day &ldquo;Autobiography of a Yogi&rdquo; fell off the shelf. Adano recognized Yogananda&rsquo;s face on the book. He read the book from beginning to end. He wrote to Yogananda and Yogananda wrote back &ldquo;none come unto the Father, but by me. I accept you as a student.&rdquo; Adano then found a job as a chef in a Chinese restaurant. Then he took the SRF lessons and soon got a letter from Yogananda that said &ldquo;Prepare yourself for initiation.&rdquo; 1:00 He took a bath and sat down in front of the picture. In a few minutes, he felt a big thumb on his forehead. Adano&rsquo;s eyes started flaring up and he walked in that state for 7 days. He could see the future, but couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. It phased down after he stopped analyzing it. Adano wrote again and ask where he could get 100 books about God. Yogananda said, &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the book compared to 15 silence in the Soul.&rdquo; It took Adano 18 years to achieve this. 1:10 Maple syrup has iron. Cherries have iron. Black olives. &ldquo;A little bit of anything is medicine, too much is toxic.&rdquo; 1:20 &ldquo;There is a time, place, and a season for everything.&rdquo; King Solomon (King Solar-man)</p>
<p>Adano00_4ScienceoftheSoulQ1NW4 - God as the Divine Creative Intelligence, knowing our origins, in the science of the soul you must always get the same result / the same common experience, what the same common experience of man? = peace, bliss, God is not a person sitting on a throne, man must accept a wide scope of god that he can relate to tangibly, to a dying man God is the next breath which brings him joy because he has more life to pursue his desires, this joy is God to a dying man, to a man who is poor God is the joy of winning the sweepstakes or gotten an inheritance because he is secure now that he can pay his bills, removing his fear and insecurity. The common feeling is Joy. The person who is sorrowful and needs sympathy from his fellow man. The moment it is extended to him is joy. You walk out on the street and the rain is falling and your clothes are wet and someone comes along and offers you an umbrella, that brief Joy is God. He is making us realize through our very structure that He is the Joy of ourselves. The Saints call it Bliss, the Divine Rapture, ordinary people call it Joy. Prayer is the first link in the Science of the Soul, Jesus being asked how to Pray. Pray is a privilege and a two way communication, prayer brings results according to how it is applied. Prayer in a transmitting stage should be asking the Creative Intelligence for understanding. The second type of prayer is reception (the adult prayer), in this stage God is talking to us giving us ideas or inspiration to act in the environment. Some of us cannot accept inspiration from God because we have a mental conflict because we cannot tell fellow man that God has talked us. God is the divine broadcaster as a divine joy coming in the heart and this broadcasting force is coming through us to insure us against the pull of negative vibrations in the environment so we can face of obligations and work in the environment. Reasoning blocks the wonderment of consciousness (child-like quality), and reason causes the inner life to dry up, but Reason, logic, and experimentation is the second link in the science of the soul because it allows us to believe and know the creative forces, wisdom, divine reasoning, intuition. Prayer can be brought into a day to day experimentation alone or in groups, using our reasoning to plan and work in our environment, a proper, balanced existence in our environment and we are an extension of our environment. Prayer cannot create a microphone, it takes reason also. At 39 minutes, good summary of above. However, over attachment is a burden of reason and logic, so the next stage is meditation, how do we transcend the pull of our desires by the very things we have constructed around us so they don&rsquo;t become a burden to the mind. Meditation is that next link that frees us and helps us to transcend the pull. Meditation is the ability now to receive the thought waves from the Creative Intelligence surrounding you, flowing through you, inspiring you to the oneness with the Creator. The Soul is an extension of the Creator, like the image is an extension of the original form. Breaking the illusion that we are separated from Him. Example of the reflections of the moon in ten glasses of water, breaking glasses, mopping up water, and getting back to the original image (feeling the oneness back). Meditation is an acronym for Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities Towards an Intuitive Observation / Oneness with Numenon. Being independent of the five senses for the first time. A total identity with the divine life. You can&rsquo;t stay in that state, so don&rsquo;t be despondent when you shrink back out of that state otherwise you would be taken away by men in white coats. Joy from Prayer (sending / receiving), Joy from Reason, and Joy from Oneness of who you are because you are transcending the pull of the senses, lined up with the divine current consciously. Master can assume the karmic debt and extend the period of payoff without extra interest. The technique is called Initiation (baptism) drawing the energies toward an inward flow. See the radiant form of the Master. &ldquo;As many received him to them gave ye the power to be Sons of God,&rdquo; radiant light. Stories of life control: Jesus raising the dead, Lazarus (rich and poor), the Centurion&rsquo;s child, himself. &ldquo;My God, my God, why has though forsaken me&rdquo; was Jesus&rsquo; mantra from Psalm 22 allowed Jesus to pull the energy into the brain and hold it. Blue is Christ Intelligence, five pointed star that looks like a Dove diving down like when Jesus was being baptized. The Science of the Holy Breath is a gift, Master Yogananda empowered many to initiate. Initiation gives the person the key to shift gears so that you can go on.</p>
<p>Adano00_4SolarQ4NW7 - Certain illnesses require immunization, but to not become toxic wash the area with apple cider vinegar and put castor oil on it. Sake is the most neutral alcohol. One teaspoon of local alcohol when traveling as a natural immunization for the colon. Plantain must be cooked. 10 Cashew is a fruit (cashew pear). Vine ripened / falling off the vine is best for tomatoes raw, otherwise cooked. Sprouted beans have high content of nitrogen with protein or cook it with grain. 20 Mushrooms should be cooked otherwise the spores can take hold in the colon (manure). Story about New Yorker peanut farming in Texas not realizing peanuts grow underground. 30 Salted peanuts are not the best. Peanuts are needed for protein and for the reaction on the liver. It has a mineral that is ideal for the liver, making it elastic. Good for alcoholics. Raw peanuts are not the best. Two teaspoons apple cider vinegar, two teaspoons honey, and 8 ounces of distilled water is the only thing you should drink while eating. Eat a solar food after a difficult conversation to relax the body. Phases out the reaction of hostility. 40 Yucca has to be cooked. Uses for various foods. Dextrinization to make food &ldquo;high octane.&rdquo; Bypasses time in the colon for utilization. 180 degrees 15-20 minutes. 50 Almonds to set your weight. Add an almond for another 10 pounds, remove an almond to decrease 10 pounds. 1:00 Drink cold liquids to gain weight. Drink warm liquids to lose weight. Carbon dioxide causes bloating which is a result of fermenting toxins. Dancing is good to reduce CO2. &ldquo;Autopractic technique&rdquo; = working on yourself. &ldquo;Shake and shiver.&rdquo; 1:10 30 years to muck it up, 10 year cycle x 3. Three score and ten does not mean to die. It means to become the patriarch to show them how to live without the conditions. When people live to 100 then do more decision activity. So you would be eating less because it requires less heavy foods to make decisions, but the brain wouldn&rsquo;t be ready before then. You have to grow up and see it all before you make the decision. 1:20 When you eat and the time you eat it, attitude still plays an important part because even Jesus says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you put in that defiles you, it is what comes out that defiles you.&rdquo; The enzymes working on the minerals in the saliva creates toxicity from the sonic resonance of the words. It depends on how you say it. 1:30 Adano helps somebody with cramps. It&rsquo;s not the calcium, it&rsquo;s the iron that&rsquo;s the real problem.</p>
<p>Adano00_05FromEdQ4NW1 - The script is only 99% valid. 1% is random surprise which is reserved. He who is strong enough to wrench the dice out of the hand of the decision of Fate, changes the whole game, but you have to have the strength. The 1% is defying the laws in terms of existing conditions which he has to face. Kal is time. Sat is conscious. The path of the realized man is one of conscious exhortation by verbalization over the time relationship by anxiety. The universe is a sonic process geared down to geometry to exhibit time. Time takes precedence of geometry and sonics takes precedence over time. Optics is needed to examine it. Sonic can only be heard. 10 We must live our sonics. The movie Altered States showed the fallacy of chemistry over time. Adano falling off the building. His brain was operating faster than optics which allowed him to push off the building and landed on the grass by six inches. 20 Moving fast versus moving slow in people&rsquo;s thinking. Environment is synchronous with input and storage of one&rsquo;s nature and you can only synchronize your action to match it to survive and that is timing and you override timing by what you say to yourself. Insecurity is the only security. I thrive on insecurity. 30 You dream in alpha and theta, but not in delta. If you can stay in delta and be aware, you find out you&rsquo;re neither man nor woman. Dead men are all in delta, but they can&rsquo;t walk with it. Realized men are in delta, walking with it, and they know their neither man nor woman. &ldquo;Those who have eyes to see let them see and ears to hear, let them hear.&rdquo; Monroe Hemi-Sync tapes. I build biofeedback machines. Everybody can raise their body temperature, but it is very hard to lower temperature except in delta. When they photograph me, the upper portion of my lungs don&rsquo;t show up. Structure of the lungs: 5 lobes - two on the left and three on the right. Electromagnetic heart is on the right side. Jesus ascended to the right hand of the father. 72,000 nerve ends in polarity so 144,000. 40 Whirling Dervish&rsquo;s. Bio-oscillation to get ketchup out of a bottle. Bioemulsification of the Dervish&rsquo;s lymphatic system. 50 God is very mundane and very sacred. The sacredness of God is that we can&rsquo;t take away His job of making a creation. We have to survive and be satisfied to be a creation and Him be the Creator, but the beautifulness is the face that principle is embodied or in-resident in this organism as sonics, the ability to talk to one-self and by virtue of this embodiment and privilege, the atoms must obey me if I act what I say. It is that simple and that powerful and that dynamic, but if I don&rsquo;t, then I must pay the consequences by virtue of denial and lack of understanding and to be out of time is very obvious after awhile because you&rsquo;re going to goof up. 50 Question: How can I better time my stock market investments? Answer: I&rsquo;m going to answer you like a certain brother of mine told another friend. Your outer life, I have no control of, no matter you may seem to love me from within your heart. If ever you need to find central focus within your brain, close your eyes and see me if you can then discover what I can do for you at that point in terms of timing. As far as the external manifestation through your open eyes, I can&rsquo;t alter that for you. I can&rsquo;t eat for you, but I can help you to help yourself to eat correctly. We can&rsquo;t really alter people&rsquo;s outer lives. The outer live is your own responsibility, to make the mistakes and learn from it. Inner life is the relationship of gurus who can trigger a sense of unity with your nature. That is a different kind of relationship. I went to Las Vegas and won back every cent he spent to stay there. I don&rsquo;t want a penny more or penny less. I went four times to Vegas and broke even each time. Using credit to your advantage</p>
<p>Adano00_AndysHouseQ3NW1 - Andy Gallencia (sp?) in El Paso. Talking your problems with others is the healthiest form of therapy there is. Common exchange releases a lot of common illnesses in us. Yogic postures for people who refuse to change. Adano explains the Lion Pose, sticking your tongue out. Children wanting recognition all the time. They don&rsquo;t have an alternative to seeing this recognition. Parents can&rsquo;t let them get away with it. Adano helps a woman with her child&rsquo;s trauma with stomach problems. 10 What color comes to mind when you think of yourself pregnant with the boy. Blue. Can you think of any disappointment? Yes. Well that is carried over into the boy, in the pregnancy. 20 Continues to discuss the boy&rsquo;s eating problem and how the solution has to start with the parents. Like a mold with a scratch like an X. All the products made by the mold also have the X. You have to fix the mold. We heal ourselves but at the same time we heal our offspring. Yogis were psychological therapists grounded in physiology. 30 Yogis did a lot of biological techniques to heal people. Martial arts - built an image of the parents and attacked the images. (gap in tape). Alcohol kept in the mouth until the enzymes break it down from stinging to tasting sweet will not affect the brain. Melissa and Adano talking while traveling. Healing is not an occupation, it&rsquo;s a karmic debt that you&rsquo;re working out with people. When you work with sickness, this is karmic debt. So don&rsquo;t take it personally. Any other occupation you can advertise, but not therapy because you are working out karmic debts. They will find you which builds your capacity to serve. You&rsquo;re a channel for the goodness that flows through you to help others. 40 Initiation establishes the frequency of the therapist: Dissolving, eliminating, strengthening, and rebuilding are frequencies because you are correcting constriction / dilation which causes these conditions to appear. (gap in tape). Consciousness is a gun, words are bullets, don&rsquo;t monkey around with it unless you get hurt with it. A real therapist doesn&rsquo;t talk much. He can&rsquo;t have ifs, and buts, and maybes in his head. Once he finds the frequency, it&rsquo;s like a machine gun. If you know your frequency is strengthening, then you use it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the target it. I have a machine gun that will shoot it down. But you don&rsquo;t worry about if they have a fortress, or an armament, or armies, the machine gun will do the job. You go to the person and hold them and strengthen the person. It isn&rsquo;t you who is healing, we only act as channels for the frequencies. The fine tuning of your technique is called timing. I only touched Andy last night, I only talked to the others because they didn&rsquo;t have anything I could work on. They all had trauma. They were all traumatized people. (gap in tape). There are certain things you have to keep to yourself to earn a livelihood. (gap in tape). Story about sheep with stripes and optic photography planting information in genetics of organisms. 50 God is not always working in the way people want it to be. Explanation of how the pyramids were made by sliding large rocks over sand. The sand acts like a ball bearing and the limestone slides on it. Once positioned, they remove the sand with a brush. (gap in tape). Limestone doesn&rsquo;t cut with a saw. You wet the limestone and then you take papyrus, jute, or horsehair. Grease it and put fillings of sand and it can be cut. (gap in tape). Adano explains Astro-cartography. 1:00 So what did I learn? Enjoy Now because that&rsquo;s all I got. The nostril that breathes is the divinity that is me and there is nobody out there to punish me for good or bad because there is no good or bad. The good or bad is my game I play with myself thinking I&rsquo;m important or unimportant. When in actuality, God became me and He&rsquo;s having a ball allowing me to make an ass of myself believing I&rsquo;m doggone stupid or ignorant or all kind of muck-up. And all He did tell me from the start of creation, &ldquo;Go forth, multiply, and have dominion, but don&rsquo;t setup your franchise.&rdquo; So multiply means produce yourself as much as you want - trillions upon trillions of times, have dominion - play the game of running the show, but don&rsquo;t hang on to nothing. So oh boy, is that a game? (somebody says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a show.&rdquo;) Yeah, and when you live it out by going through it, He says &ldquo;Here, keep your suit. Don&rsquo;t trade it back in. I don&rsquo;t need it. It&rsquo;s already yours.&rdquo; You can modify it, make it look male, female, skinny, young, fat, or aged, but it&rsquo;s all here. Permanent suit, it&rsquo;s called Living Soil. See I don&rsquo;t have a Soul, I&rsquo;m Soul, Living Soil, 144 elements in an immortal. (end of tape).</p>
<p>Adano00_AtBettysConversationsQ4NW3 - Sounds like Adano &amp; Melissa traveling at beginning of tape, Trauma is a verbalization of something in the brain. Delta - to release trauma - yawn &amp; shit. Accurate + Pressure - Acupressure. Yawning is a suction. Delta makes you tired because you think you have to be tired in that state since it usually happens when you are sleeping. (gap in tape). Discussion of working for oneself. 10 Credit cards vs. debit cards. Future forms of currency (US postage stamps). Post office and banks will merge to eliminate fraud. 20 Adano talks about currency in the future using checks and thumbprints. Quitting smoking by smoking all cigarettes in a day during mid-day. Cigarette points on ear. Take three balloons and put their faces on the balloons and then pop the balloons. The cigarette is a dependency pattern. Sticking the tongue out helps. 30 Yoga took postures from animals and are the rules to make you healthy. Disciple means learning how to be healthy. The Lion pose is to build strength like the lion. Meaning of names Bobby May = he may or may not do. Bobby = Baby. The word Joe is a &ldquo;buddy buddy&rdquo; word, friends with everybody. More discussion about names: Adano = I dunno. What is a neutral name? 40 William = William the Conqueror (came to Adano&rsquo;s clinic years before). Liz Metrik and Harry - if she goes by Elizabeth, they are equal. He is a &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; experience. Adano says that he &ldquo;harries&rdquo; Liz. Harold of Hastings went to Normandy to recruit the aid of William, Duke of Normandy, to reclaim his land in England. A monk told Harold he needed a better name. William helped him reclaim his land. The last battle Harold refused to recognize William as his partner. So they had a argument and Harold took off to the land of Hastings. They had a confrontation. Long story short, Harold gets shot in the eye and William declares him King of England, &ldquo;This land is ours.&rdquo; This was because Harold would not pay William for his help. 50 Harold has two meanings: Harry=hurry and it doesn&rsquo;t have stability. It is somebody who constantly harasses you. Herald = to bring in good news. Saint Francis of Rome - She is the Patron Saint of all drivers. Dropped Saint Christopher because the church did not think he was a real guy. Russell means to russell up, to be active. The American Indians don&rsquo;t give a name until the child is 13 years old. Then the child goes out for 24 hours and comes back with a name. Adano tells the story of a boy Adano knew that came back with a grey eagle feather from an eagle he tracked that was molting and he was called Grey Eagle. He ended up taking care of the family&rsquo;s sheep. Yogini = Female unified consciousness (vs masculine Yogi). English does not have masculine and feminine because it started out as a dialect and evolved into a language, which is its advantage over other languages.</p>
<p>Adano00_BiosonicsTonesQ5 - Guy Manners speaking for a minute &ldquo;sound is the basis for form and shape.&rdquo; and the rest are tones from the Biosonics video.</p>
<p>Adano00_ChantsRamDasQ3NW3 - First eight minutes are Adano Chanting: Thou Art My Life, Who Is In My Temple, I Am the Bubble Make Me the Sea, Elemental Song, Door of My Heart, Listen to My Heart Song, and Happiness Runs a Circular Motion. The rest is not Adano chanting.</p>
<p>Adano00_ConceptsofA77Q1NW4 - Rest is timelessness. That is the meaning for the word rest. God is the eternal principle or creative energy is in the timeless state after performing everything that there is to perform in a time state called creation. Creation exists in time. Now, there really is no time as an actual principle. There is the illusion of time in which creation must exist or appear to exist. Now, in this appearance, a unit of time is the distance light crosses the width of an electron, giving its potentiality as a creation. There really is no thing called time. The only that exists is infinite motion to the highest degree of ultrasonic movement. The creator is audible life energy. He spoke before he became the light. It&rsquo;s not a person, it&rsquo;s a principle. &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo; Audible life current that is inside our own bodies. There is music inside of us. He who can see the lord in human form has seen Him at his best. Everything in this relative world is synchronized to time. The audible life current is that pure essence that exists in timelessness. It grants permission to its lower nature, Kal, the time cycle, to make a creation. God is a Sagittarian in opposition to Scorpio in the astrological belt. No matter how Scorpio tries, he cannot overrun Sagittarius. We are Beings of Light. The whole universe started in the sign of Sagittarius. It is the only symbol that is man and animal and the only symbol that is armed to protect itself. It must have the power of life over death. The bow and the arrow is the justice point, the self destructive principle, but at the same time upholding the law. Scorpio can only sting itself or kill you. It can be destroyed by the Sagittarian. Man brought his religion from the galaxies. Alpha Centuri is the galactic center and the Cosmic Life Force is vibrating there. &ldquo;The word IS god&rdquo; that makes all the difference when John wrote his works. So man doesn&rsquo;t search for his soul, man IS soul. 10 You can&rsquo;t take out the ideations of existence out of the universe, though you can change their atomic change. Even Jesus could not enforce a dictatorial dominance over the universe. He had to work by divine will, he therefore was at the right place, at the right time, for the right confrontation at the wedding. The role of the soul living in a time cycle that knows no boundary lines save love. The master obeys the law, but he shows by his love that the law has no control over him. All that time asks us is to face your obligations, no avoiding them. The highest form of therapy for a schizophrenic individual is to fight back. &ldquo;Mother, I would rather do it myself.&rdquo; So involvement is the key word in spiritual growth. Realize your involvement because you are alive and you have a commitment to yourself to face the time cycles and their repercussions. We do not have to reincarnate, we have to resurrect. (question from the audience) Jesus had to be asked. No master will usurp that right though he has the power to crystallize thought because he would be exhibiting his ego. Ego is best recognized as hurrying to do something too fast without waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s dispensation. Watch out and don&rsquo;t eat your words back by being in a hurry. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna do this no more.&rdquo; What do they end up doing the next half hour? Creative intelligence makes us realize that our ego is locked into the time cycle and the time cycle is going to throw us the confrontation immediately to make us face it to eat our own words. So if you are not in a hurry, sooner or later you are going to get the experience. Everything Jesus did could have been done in 24 hours. He was not in a hurry. A Master does not alter the thought patterns of people who don&rsquo;t want to be altered. That setup their own ego and block it. He works with those who are humble and those who are receptive and karmically linked because He Himself is Divine Love without coercion. He&rsquo;s unconditional love. Therefore He wouldn&rsquo;t use the person for His personal gain. He has no gain to have by performing a miracle because there is no miracle to perform. He brings their desires into focus by responding to the time cycle when that desire is supposed to crystallize for them. He knows exactly that split second when it was gonna happen. And if you live the spiritual life you&rsquo;ll notice the spiritual life is photo finish most of the time. Now I&rsquo;m talking from experiences now. Those photo finishes I love you. Adano sings the &ldquo;photo finish&rdquo; song. &ldquo;How I love you, how I love you, my dear old photo finish.&rdquo; But you see photo finish is good.</p>
<p>Adano00_ElPasoQ4NW1 - (Very bad tape). Biorhythms. Rule #1 don&rsquo;t panic, rule #2 don&rsquo;t panic, rule #3 don&rsquo;t panic. Who I am will kill me if I panic because I will think I will be saved, go to heaven and that bull. &ldquo;What I am&rdquo; saved me more than who. What I am is that I am atoms in the form of a tissue mechanism and if it don&rsquo;t breath, they bury it and if it does breath it stays alive regardless of going to hell or heaven. You gotta breath and who the hell would wait for a dead man to show up to torment him. Up your right nostril is god or brother Jesus, up your left nostril is Satan or Lucifer, in the middle is you, this piece of skin. (Ginger laughing).

<p>Adano00_Flagstaff_DiscussionQ3NW1 - Jesus was a Jew and the servant was a Greek, so the man didn&rsquo;t want Jesus to come to his house. &ldquo;If you but say the word, my servant will be well.&rdquo; The subtle function of physics tells what is going on. &ldquo;Not in all Israel have I seen such faith. Go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Not in all the reality of the &ldquo;is-ness&rdquo; state have there been any form that breathes in the unified field that generates a conviction to the source of its origin until now to confront the Christ principle locked up in form as a request to insulate it against the feedback of the five senses of the sick person that is going to be imposed or abused or criticized by the surrounding community. Here you ask this shaman to come to your house. All these are interplays of the biological fears. When we get down to the atomic physics, we get to the core, &ldquo;go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; This is kinesiology right now. He is healing another individual at a distance by the command. At the atomic level, the servant is healed because he relates to his winning ness principle. The time lapse of the love has no limitation between forms. Pain is a necessary ingredient to stimulate respect and immunity. (Gap in tape). 10 God is a humorous kind of fellow. One person said to me a long time ago, &ldquo;we only meditate on God as man, you mean there is no female part of God?&rdquo; Yes, God is mother too, its a &ldquo;her,&rdquo; its not a &ldquo;ME.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;come let ME make man,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;come let US make man.&rdquo; So there is a father / mother God you see? It is only we who have been educated in this part of the world that think of God as father all the time. We totally ignore that God is both principles. You cannot have a creation with out both principles in it. The male / female or the positive / negative or the passive / active principle. So the scripture is accurate when it says, &ldquo;come let US make man.&rdquo; The word US is plural and man is a dualistic force of positive and negative, male / female, &ldquo;male and female created them.&rdquo; We have the male man and the female man. &ldquo;And God breathed into man the breath of life and man became living soul.&rdquo; But man is the atom, that is the image we are made in. So we say &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; or &ldquo;Atom,&rdquo; the proton or protean man. But a proton is only a part of the atom, there is one part that is constantly spinning out. Scriptures are very symbolic language. The rib of Adam is Eve, which is the electron. When you split the atom, you see the rib action. The orbital pattern of the electron spins around the proton to form the atom. And we don&rsquo;t live in an atmosphere, we live in an atom-sphere. We are an image, this physical frame is an actual image of the cosmic sound and light called God, pure light. Sound and light are the two forces. Light is the passive force and sound is the active force. So God the Father is the active force. The proton always carries the sound in it and the electron carries the light in it. This the yin / yang of the Chinese philosophy too. God is pure light or pure life, which is the neutron which splits in the atom. God is in his creation. The neutron triggers intelligibility in other forms of life to recognize this relationship. The god is me loves the god in you. God has become all. The neutron is in all of us. When you meditate, you look at the point between the eyebrows. The light is shining in the darkness, the desire nature, the cohesive function of the atom. &ldquo;But the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; Within this cohesive force, there is no comprehension going on, only observation. You are also doubting me, which is the darkness. The part that doubts what it hears, Satan, the adversary, the centripetal energy. When the atom is split, something has gone someplace. If you split six pounds of material, only 5.5 ounces are left. How did it get out of the container? We sing a chant, &ldquo;who is in my temple? All the doors do open themselves (endocrine glands). All the lights do light themselves (the energy inside). Darkness like a dark bird, flies away.&rdquo; You are triggering by meditation an atomic reaction in your spinal column, starting the process of spiritual evolution or spiritual expansion, speeding up your spiritual growth. Meditation is to help you realize God all the time, that He is inside of you, not outside of you. The process is to center. 20 Darkness comprehends it now. &ldquo;But let the light so shine before men.&rdquo; Shining with the exact replica of you. &ldquo;You see Me, you see the Father.&rdquo; That is breaking through from the electron level to the proton level, from the light level to the sound level. You will hear the actual sound the proton is making now. The waves are music set to the octave. The whole universe is a musical octave. In the octave, you begin to realize the Christ or the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; of god, the true light of god embodied in the proton, there is where the sound current goes on, the true kernel of your nature. Realization is the whole journey and it has to be inside the human body. There are two lessons, humility through ethical living. Two, the transformation of the animal body, the decaying body, to the non-decaying body that can dematerialize / materialize by divine law, like the caterpillar to the butterfly that never breaks down. To him that overcometh, I will make you a fixture in the house of the lord, an expression of this reality. When this body has thrown off corruption, it is a glory unto the lord. When we drop off the relationship of the electron and become involved with the proton itself, we begin to transform the body itself. Protein comes from the sun. Man used to draw the energy of the mechanism through the medulla oblongata. Man had that ability at one time but then he got engrossed with the electron. Man&rsquo;s body is composed of 16 elements. The atomic physics will verify how many times man has fallen from the protonic nature. As we travel into space, we will produce bodies with less and less minerals in the body. The more we change our environment, the more this body will depend on direct energy and less on solids and liquids. Between teenager to 40 or 50 is the gorge period, but after that it is tapering off. You ever try keeping up with a baby? Their protonic energy is active. The meditation is a technique and a process, not a goal, specially designed for the purpose of conservation of this energy. The advanced approach of conservation is to learn to appreciate solitude and inactivity, so that the body will have a chance to recycles / recharge / revitalize itself. We do this when we are asleep. The waking up is a reinforced thought pattern of getting up. We are far more tired when we are asleep. The spurt of energy comes from having to go to work, etc. 30 The disciples were criticized for falling asleep when they were meditating. The bodily structure wanted to taper off. We don&rsquo;t have to repeat the mistakes they made, we can utilize the feeling of waking up from sleep, and transfer this into a conscious sleep. So you are going to consciously close the eyes and consciously relive the feeling of waking up. You want to try it? Adano leads them through an exercise. 32 Put your feet together with the toes touching each other standing up. Turn the hands the way the feet are, turned out. Elbows into the side. Hold it for a count of 50. Enjoy. You feel loose and limber now? Hold the position until the hurting sensation ceases. It hurts because you are conscious. This is very spiritual. Adano leads a meditation now. (Gap in tape). Adano tells a story of a woman with several degrees who is a waitress. Maybe someday when she&rsquo;s ready to move on to be her own boss, then all those labels will be her presentation for her ability to run her own business. Now she has two kids who are almost 18 now. That is what Adano calls &ldquo;low profile attitude.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s amazing, some people know how to do it naturally. Adano comments on a woodpecker and proper attitudes toward animals.</p>
<p>Adano00_FlagstaffQ2NW3 - Meditation, giving thanks for enlightenment and unfoldment. The audible life stream has become you. Hearing the music and knowing it has become you. 20 Thank you. Any questions? Question: Would you talk about realization, what it means? Adano: In the early stages of understanding, most of us try to get to a state where we think we know and will never be ignorant anymore. This craving is what the eastern people call your delusion. You will continue to feed the fire of the craving to be deluded, but you will arrive at some preposterous, unimaginable place in your awareness thinking you know all there is to know. When it actuality, realization is the acceptance that god became you. According to Paul, after many years of his own internal searching and many unusual experiences over the control of the environments by his thoughts, he discovered how deluded he was and made this remark. &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the lord.&rdquo; Hence he left the room and went to work to be a tent maker and lived for the moment of now by being very practical every moment. Even when he died by giving up his life for his fellow man, he demonstrated the fruit of the spirit instead of the gift of the spirit. The gift is the miraculous power and the tremendous desire to think you know you know. The fruit of the spirit is the understanding that god became you and you cannot become him. Therefore every moment of the now, you are god in motion. You are not a god, you&rsquo;ll never become a god, but you are totally satisfied that god became you. Come let US make man, that is sonics and optics united to make a manifestation with a polaristic process locked up in it. Every moment you accept that realization, you will discover one fact about yourself, you can only live what you say to yourself. You can&rsquo;t take a bath in a blueprint bathtub. Therefore realization is not thinking to become, it is not a blueprint, it is an experiment with yourself. All I can see here is reproductions of self. Love the lord with all your mind, strength, and soul. 30 This marvelous temple is made up of 144 elements and everything else is made up of the same. Love your neighbors AS yourself. Once you let go of the feeling to insulate, that is when the rapport, the unification, and the intensity begins. You feel it like a tingling sensation. The more conscious you are of the tingling sensation, the more you begin to see the whole spirit (Holy Spirit), kundalini, pentecostal, slain in the spirit. You are unfolding in the energy field, biokinesis. Conscious recognition of it. If you look for the simple in the moment to moment, it will always be miraculous. If you keep looking for the miraculous, it may only occur once before you pass out of the body. In the structure of your nature, you have rates of acceleration of your brain representing states of consciousness. Oxygen is the only gas that produces the phenomenon of consciousness. Beta = photographic focusing, eyes are like a camera. Alpha = slowing down the lens, becoming more geometrically specific and not hazy. Selectivity synchronizes to purpose and is very exact. &ldquo;A man is as good as his word.&rdquo; Forced to live your thoughts or they will slam back in your face. 40 Theta = the geometry plays with unfinished actions. We never can finish all our actions, there is always a little left over because we are an organism that must live for tomorrow. Futuristic confrontation. This is the basis of attachment and the cause of all suffering. There we call the dream state. It is necessary to motivate you. You have to program it to replay. Theta is the reservoir of the unfinished dreams in terms of geometry. Delta = the dreamless state, where all geometry disappears in your head. It is blank. Peace that passes understanding. No more verbalization or analysis to describe it to yourself. But that blank is not an end. An end would generate geometry. That blank or peace is a competency or strength. &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; A biodynamic resonance that doesn&rsquo;t have a geometry, but has a vibrancy. The highest yoga is (Adano stands on his two feet and walks). God is for the living, not for the dead. The movie called Cocoon, fixated and liberated individuals. Even after he buries her, he still won&rsquo;t accept liberation. (gap in tape). It is a matter of accepting the christ nature in yourself. As you recognize it, you can exercise it. It has to do with your right to be a being. (gap in tape) 50 Question about the apples decomposing. Adano: First is moldy and powdery and that is the eliminative principle. &ldquo;Creativity energy flowing though me will eliminate all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of the individual.&rdquo; If it retains a little fluid / shriveled up is the dissolving principle. Dried up hard, no powder, no water, that is the strengthening effect. If it remains firm for a whole year and it doesn&rsquo;t collapse, it doesn&rsquo;t shrink, turn powder or watery, that is the rebuilder. Beta = eliminative, alpha = dissolving, theta = strengthening, delta = rebuilding, omega = apple grows, avatar, descent of god into flesh. Seeing at versus seeing through (looking at the subatomic particles). It has to do with focusing. Questions: Is there a particular meditation for each state of the apple. Adano: Meditation is a biological two way communication between the external geometry of the eyes and the internal geometry of the eyes. You have to sit back and listen. The program is already passing through the cells in the four different speeds, so just sit down and enjoy the show. You are the audience. &ldquo;Man must appreciate that he is a witness.&rdquo; 1:00 Close the eyes and watch. Then the levels will start unfolding. You will see the beta / powdery effect, then alpha where your eyes get watery, then theta where you are dreaming that Dracula is biting you, then delta where you enjoy the movie to the full extent, that is the rebuilding effect. Then if you decide you want to start your own movie, that is omega. Then you are living with it for the first time, no guilt or fear or frustration or making up for mistakes. The real anguish is if you think to stay something and it happens, you think you caused it. In actuality, you have lined up the brain to the unified field. E=mc2. You better not think or say more and you keep your mouth shut. And you enjoy living in the world in a simple, rational, humble way. Ability to be practical moment to moment is the test. The next test is how immune is he, that tell us how divine. If the saint and the sinner get the same disease, then there is something wrong in their practice. 1:10 He is not practicing meditation, he is living meditation, but you have to start someplace, so you sit down and watch and use a respiratory function to shift gears and observe. You will experience the sonic resonance and elation of the mechanism due to healthiness. You can live more objectively. The timing becomes obvious to you to act. It is not how smart you are, it is how soon you get through the gate of heaven before it close. It is timing. The summary of the meditative process is the timing of the daily events in your life, regardless if you close your eyes, is the evidence that creative intelligence is directing your survival. Then you are living meditation. Whatever you do will be synchronized to the time to be practical. When is the appropriate time to act. The wise man learns to function with the timing. Once you begin to focus that way, the moments of time will allow you to act.</p>

<p>Adano00_Hoovering2Q4 - All Cymatics sounds.</p>
<p>Adano00_IMEBEQ1NW1 - Pain is essential to develop immunity. If you never had a confrontation, there is no way for immunity to develop. The highest process is to go through it. Pickup your cross and follow me. Each person experiences their own Scope of the Horror and not to be afraid of it, overcoming the unconsciousness of it. You can&rsquo;t become unconscious of the Me in you. The I is constantly reminded by the Me because Be will always be there presenting the bill to I and Me is the bill. So, for that reason, we gain this by the process of going through. When there is no more Me to clean up, would Be be satisfied? Be will not be satisfied, because Be itself would be bored and start again creating an I to give it freedom to generate a use for Me. Me would emerge again from the Be. Come let us make Man in our own Image and Likeness. Be cannot stay stagnant or non-active. Even if it creates I as a form of expression of itself with individuality and complete freedom to squander its existence. Be will forced to generate another Me. There is no way for you to be unconsciousness, non-existing, or non-immortal. When you lock into the immortal ness of yourself, in the I-state, Me-state, or Be-state you are unified, free men or lord of yourself. Health is Be - I - Me. You call it I-Beam, so you light up. Dreams are misfiled data and reruns of Me. I and Be are busy talking to each other in your sleep. The Me is sleeping. Me responds because Be uses it to confront I. Be stores Me and stores I and I has no place to operate in without Be. I could not come out into existence before Be. For that reason, Me is already existing with I and both are stored in Be. Then Be is greater than I and greater than Me, but Be is totally helpless without I and the Me operating in it, even though it stores it, Be would be useless and serve no purpose. Therefore, Be craves exchange and interaction between I and Me. Which needs your Love? Be. 10 Listen, Listen to my heart song. It is Be that sings the song and guarantees the assurance to I that the Me principle is there to back it up. But never I is going to sing to Be. I can forsake Be, but Be cannot let down I. The heart is neutral, the I is the upper part from the cervical to the top of the head. The Me goes from the Lumbar to the Sacral to the Coccyx. The Be is the heart in the center. The real love of God is the healthiness of your Beingness. I breathe, therefore I am. I relate, therefore I retain. I share, therefore I am everything. Then your creativity starts to flow, Be is creativity / self-sustaining. God isn&rsquo;t punching no clock, he is punching customers. And he is resting one day a week. Solar Nutrition - The fifth rule is &ldquo;Live to eat in order to live not to eat.&rdquo; Three score ten is the natural timing for the breatharian transformation. God has individualistic emancipation of society. Each person has their own horoscope. In one lifespan, there are three periods of development in each lifespan. 30-35, 45-65, and 85-95. 20 Abstain, injury situation, or natural progression. The natural progression process is for everybody. There is not other great or glorious contribution to the Creative Self than to live in synchronous harmony with it. I, Me, Be makes more sense living in the Now. 30 When all else fails, follow the instructions. The Garden of Eden is more of a focal point of behavior of Man. It is allegorical. Man had to make the &ldquo;make the mistake.&rdquo; All life forms have a blood type as a reminder process to interact. Macrobiotics found that the chemistry is 80 / 20 to be normal and flowing on time. We don&rsquo;t have years, we have revolutions, so you are endless and youthful all the time, like the movie Cocoon. Intrinsically you are atomic mass utilizing a tissue fold to interact. You are always living in the now with newer, better opportunity of exploring. Andy and Mary (Chief War Eagle), Andy used to say &ldquo;Life is simple, but difficult to apply.&rdquo; No one can see through your clumsiness. You have to work out your own clumsiness. Rule number 1, don&rsquo;t panic, rule number 2, don&rsquo;t panic, rule number 3, don&rsquo;t panic. Just keep muddling your way through. 40 Discussion between people in the room.</p>
<p>Adano00_InvolvementEmergenceQ3NW1 - The inner eye has to be open to understand beingness acting on consciousness and beingness acting on beingness. Now we as human beings can bring ourselves up to the Christ state, or the Master state. We must attain masterhood. We have to attain this state, &ldquo;none come unto the father but by me.&rdquo; We all have to come to that state of development. Then from that state inward, it is God himself, the Creative Intelligence, that pulls us up. We have a physical lift from the body itself and you may find yourself lifting off the ground going through these states or you may see internally how the electrical structure is developed and you go into what is called Moksha or liberation. But this is internal, one can&rsquo;t see this on a physical level, one has to see this on the extrasensory level. You begin to feel the body tingling and you don&rsquo;t crave solids and liquids as much. These are the outward symptoms of the change. A surely of consciousness permeates you. Because the ethical life has to develop before arriving at consciousness acting on consciousness. You judge your spiritual development by the length of time the peace remains with you in a conscious state. When it remains 24 / 7 / 365, you have reached the Christ state. 10 Question: The the Soul leave the body at different times? Answer: Man is Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t have a Soul. The chemical form breaks down, the electrical and causal (ideational) forms remains. The link breaks after 72 hours. Nobody is changed by Christ, they have to make the decision inside. Adano tells story about the man in Canada who was locked up for drugs. It was imposed on him by society to put him in a dungeon. He decided to pray. He eventually gets out after 21 days because he prays for forgiveness. He sees a light come into the room and a voice &ldquo;none come unto the father but by me.&rdquo; The Christ radiated his light into him. His finger prints have changed have this so they cannot prosecute him. Christ met him at the halfway mark. No matter how far you go, you have to make the turnaround. It might be dramatic or subtle, through love. Story of Saint Paul and his conversion. 20 &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why doest thou persecute me?&rdquo; He was doing it with mental remorse. He had internal conflicts in his subconscious mind. Story about Adano falling off the building and the physical body lying there with the electrical / ideational part went out into time and space. &ldquo;If this is death, I enjoy it. There is nothing to be afraid of. I and my Father are one.&rdquo; The Divine Consciousness told him to go back to teach people how to deal with pain. 30 Doctor having to take a different elevator and running into Adano dying on the table and saving his life. God acting through the doctors to have somebody who knew how to help Adano run into him. We have the right to live each moment and have divine life pull us out. Adano saw himself in oneness with everything, God is the Oneness, all the Realized Masters were there and made him realize that he was one with God. He only heard &ldquo;you and I are one.&rdquo; But can I stay here? But the Consciousness said &ldquo;no, you must go back.&rdquo; So then I accepted this, the first rule of the Consciousness, living by divine will. So the test is to go back into the body, that was his choice. If he chose not to go back, only he would suffer, not divine intelligence. 40 (Gap in tape) A Master is not trapped in the lower levels of consciousness. He can get out by remembering one basic truth. &ldquo;He that does the will of the Lord is my brother and sister. And he that follows in My word is My disciple.&rdquo; Following the words of the Master binds us to him through all the levels of creation. We hold back the Divine Principle by avoidance. You sense that your existence is eternal, but you are afraid something will be lost in you if you die. But the strange thing is that when you go to sleep, you do not know if you are a man or a woman. Where have you gone in consciousness? When you terminate physical existence, you don&rsquo;t have continuity of memory, you must reincarnate. It is the last desires that carry over to the next life. 50 You have been cheated of fulfilling your desire when you still have the desire in a baby&rsquo;s body. The whole mind is in turmoil. How do we free ourselves? It takes a Realized Person to enter your consciousness and raise you to the point where you can see this correction. The christ intelligence does this in a realized person. It becomes active at the last moment in the mechanism. There we can generate the consciousness to lock into your consciousness and release you of the desire. The Realized person whispers in the dying person&rsquo;s right ear, &ldquo;The check did not bounce and everything is ok and the Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; Helping the individual pass over in consciousness. 1:00 Adano shouting &ldquo;who is dying!&rdquo; to get his consciousness moving. The doctor&rsquo;s had been saying that he was going to die, the bickering made Adano &ldquo;over involved in weakness and over involved in strength.&rdquo; So say positive things in the presence of dying people. Find out what they are holding onto and help them break free of those desires. We can help the individual in these critical moments to break free. Taking full stock of what we are involved with and getting some sense of direction. Jesus saying &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be for me and for mammon.&rdquo; (gap in tape). Jesus going to the seashore when he got too &ldquo;bogged down&rdquo; by people. 1:10 Divine will is to recognize that &ldquo;you are always at the right place, at the right time, for the right experience.&rdquo; No experience is good or bad, but an opportunity to test your behavior. An opportunity to test your attitude that this experience is neither good nor bad. There is only one way to behave, that is to love. (end of Satsang, clapping). Questions and answers. How does man know if he is raising his consciousness. Adano goes through the levels: energy acting on matter. The light shining in the brain. (but the darkness comprehends it not). 1:20 Freshen up with vital consciousness. Energy acting on energy. The saliva will taste like honey / nectar which descends from the brain. Consciousness acting on energy. You can move physical objects with your consciousness. The time cycle responds to you. Story about Jesus turning water into wine. The craving of Mary was strong to have her son do something to impress. She tells the servants &ldquo;do what he tells you.&rdquo; The atmosphere is set with desire. If he had the desire, he would have brought wine, but instead he is satisfying the mother&rsquo;s wish, but still admonishing her behavior.</p>

<p>Adano00_Psalm4ChantsQ3NW2 - Adano explains Psalm 4. Brain emits full potential when eyes are 1/2 open 1/2 closed. &ldquo;Salvation belong unto the lord.&rdquo; Darshan radiates so much love, that 5000 people can be immobilized by the love / spiritualized. They feel like their vitality is going out of them. &ldquo;Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness!&rdquo; That means that the consciousness now responds with attunement when we utilize the right law of meditation. &ldquo;Thou has enlarged me when I was in distress.&rdquo; Consciousness expanded when negative thought patterns were trying to take over. We don&rsquo;t know what will happen when we start meditation. Cold sweats, pounding in my head, trembling, being pulled by the hair roots. When we are partially doubtful and partially calm, so they are afraid to continue and they avoid. David is showing how we should respond in this condition inside, 1/2 restless and 1/2 calm. &ldquo;Hear me when I call.&rdquo; Let me feel that the contact of the inner peace is flowing through me. My consciousness expanded beyond the negative pull when I began to meditate. &ldquo;Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.&rdquo; Let this conscious flow through me so I am competent to handle it and I know without doubt everything is working as it should. This is confirmation that the symptoms that are occurring in us in meditation are real. &ldquo;Oh ye sons of man, how long will you turn my vanity into shame.&rdquo; 10 The consciousness is saying: How long will you go on doubting the possibilities of the experience being genuine and what you think is happening to you is partial and not the real thing. You will try to accept partially, doubting. &ldquo;Oh ye sons of men.&rdquo; Higher consciousness is talking to egos. &ldquo;How long will you love vanity,&rdquo; the unrealistic thought patterns. They are not real, they are like show. How long will you try to seek after temporary conditions are not permanent. All the symptoms of cosmic conscious or god awareness are identical like sickness. There is a difference. Sickness is permanently there, creating a disturbance in your cells. In cosmic consciousness, you have an experience of it knowing that you are master of it. It doesn&rsquo;t affect, you transcend. &ldquo;Stand in awe.&rdquo; Accept yourself and be it (cosmic consciousness). Don&rsquo;t deviate, stick to the path, this is the discipline. 20 You really trust the lord when you are sound asleep. The bed is a sacred spot. Be still as if you were sound asleep. The initiate accepts and lives it out. He doesn&rsquo;t run from his environment. &ldquo;Offer the sacrifice of righteousness.&rdquo; Send up the thought &ldquo;Father, I love you.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t even know what he looks like and you love him. You have to make that particular attempt to turn you on inside. You have to trust the vital life power coming up your spine, kundalini. The science of the souls is very specific. The Psalms show you how to relate and make it work for yourself. Now we have covered the two types of people that exist, we covered the relationship of the government and the system that we exist in, these are in the first two Psalms. In the third Psalm we see now the head of the government has to find inner communion to offset the harassment that we call modern day lobbyism. So we are moving on now to man&rsquo;s happiness is in god&rsquo;s favor. How can inner consciousness gain contentment by total awareness, that&rsquo;s god&rsquo;s favor. The mind is not evaluating in terms of compassion, mercy, and grace, but only in terms of the insecurity. You can&rsquo;t live without relating to a higher part of your being as a supporting force within you. The man of spirituality is known by the fruit of his consciousness and his inner peace. Joy comes from within, not from without. One can have a bumper crop and still be discontent, but the joy you feel everyday is entirely different. It spreads out through your entire being and it starts in the heart center. There you hear the bells ringing inside, when the heart chakra opens up. 30 If the huge mastodons were here, what would have happened? They would have kept multiplying. Nature has a way of maintaining the balance. &ldquo;The meek will inherit the earth.&rdquo; Who will survive? The strong, or the weak, or the meek? It&rsquo;s the meek. The humble, attuned, synchronized to live itself is the meek, and he survives. He is accepting divine law. We are not here to run from the world, we are here to live in it. But only by living it can we understand it and understanding is the highest thing you should get if you are going to get anything out of spirituality. You can&rsquo;t carry riches to the grave. Death is a condition, if you understand it, you surpass it. Death is your last opposition. So are supposed to be free, in charge of this mechanism. Pituitary is the mental microphone of the mind. Broadcast, &ldquo;father I love you.&rdquo; This is the greatest mantra. Real meditation is a flow of love. 40 Total consciousness does not entertain negative living. It will fall apart. Jesus says &ldquo;call no man fool.&rdquo; There must be a reason for this, a karmic debt. Clown is a different thing. When you say a man is a fool, that is a different thing, you are cutting the very vital life principle, representing the creator, and addressing the creator as a fool. The consciousness cannot stand the fact of destruction by its own volition. Though it has the desire to destroy itself at times, but even then it cannot stand the fact because it is committed to repeat the principle all over to test itself. It will have to go through the process of learning again. It has to come back in another body form to learn out the mistake of killing itself. When we look at ourselves, to be happy, it must come from inside. 45 Chanting begins for the rest of the tape.</p>
<p>Adano00_RebirthingGuidedMeditationQ3NW3 - Adano guides the group through letting go of birth trauma through color recycling, &ldquo;first month, second month, third, fourth, fifth, six, seventh, eighth, ninth, the doctors are working, cutting the cord, and you are breathing in pure joy through your lungs.&rdquo; Black, grey, etc. indigo, violet, then changing into white light. &ldquo;Like a fog off the brain, light a weight of the chest, shoulders, etc. All through the toes, ankles, calves, kneecaps, thigh, hips, waist, chest, shoulders, necks, arms, top of the skull, the whole body is feeling the joy coming up.&rdquo; Yawning. &ldquo;You are the breath. You are not the body, you are the breath in and around the body, coming in and going out.&rdquo; 10 Yawn. Feeling freedom. Yawn. Equi-flowing now. Feel your oneness with the breath, existence, conscious, joy. Energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared. You are one with the chair, the floor, your breath, the entire room, the environment. Every sound becoming one and you are the container. Feel it coming up the spine. 20 Adano tells Bill Lockridge from El Paso that he was very steady. Modern man needs the equal flow because he is constantly driving vehicles and put into the survival decision making, so he needs the living in the now more than the agricultural man. 27 (gap in tape) Feel the air around your skin. That air blowing against your skin is creative love, sustaining the universe. Within that air there are many gases and they all have different fragrances. Only one sustains the consciousness and all the other accentuate our quality. The more you feel the warmth of the air, the more the love is intensified in your body. Feel all the texture of the skin relaxing, absorbing and nourishing itself from the air. You are nourished directly throughout the entire surface of the body. (meditation follows). Between you and the realized ones, the feeling of the air on the surface of your body. 40 (still meditating). 53 Yukteswar says, &ldquo;get up and sweep the floor.&rdquo; You can get lost in the drunkenness of peace. The joy of now, but the more you recognize it from your saliva, the more you are actually living on that ambrosia. That&rsquo;s why the ancient Greek gods lived on ambrosia and nectar, Mount Olympus is right here (probably pointing at the point between the eyebrows). This principle is flowing up in the saliva and oxygen that comes in to activate the whole form is the catalyst and the tongue that is designed for resonance of sonics is the bridge between the gas and the biological chemistry setting up the flavor in the mouth. Moving the tongue around the mouth releases the enzymes. You can tap into the enzymic process in the body and have the cells replenish themselves in the conscious level instead of the unconscious level of sleep. It is basically within the whole organism, but we don&rsquo;t look at it this way. When we understand it, we have access to the reservoir of all the truths that the ancient people were trying to teach.</p>
<p>Adano00_Solar1Q4NW1 - (must be in the 1980s because Melissa is talking around 15 minute mark.) Blood types and learning to cope with them. Put protein in first. Middle of the day, beans and rice are a complete protein. Seeds: sunflower, sesame, pumpkin. Type B or O have a piece of beef or lamb (less toxic). A little apple cider vinegar to reduce toxicity or a little wine (for the stomach&rsquo;s sake). The brain does its own self alignment through the silence level between 3-5 AM since the Earth exposure to Cosmic Rays before dawn. 10 Monotone (color) environment to slow you down and cope with routine better. Husband as confrontation reminder for the father. You can&rsquo;t tell Dad off because he pays the rent. Necessity is the mother of invention, the daughter is boredom. 20 80% alkaline, 20% acid. If you use a flesh product, always get some malic acid in your system to phase / flush out uric acids. Two teaspoons apple cider vinegar, two teaspoons honey, 8 oz distilled water. Drink two glasses per day. This allows you to be safe from the effects of the uric acid in tissue. Dextrinized bread doesn&rsquo;t make you tired. 30 Ghee made from heating butter and separating it. Two types of cholesterol in butter: white = insulator, yellow = lubricator. Ghee is better than meat to insulate and builds up bone marrow. Story of sugar, originally beet, but British found cane easier to grow. White sugar was originally for kidney disease (India / China), the brown sugar (rock sugar) was meant for eating. Yogis discovered white sugar good for restarting kidneys. Honey is neutral. 40 Cashews should be roasted. Other uses of cashews. Coconut oil is a saturated oil, ideal for massage and cosmetics. Mix it with plantain and breadfruit and it acts like a soybean oil and doesn&rsquo;t clog up your system. Cashews need to be cooked. 50 Potato should be cooked since it is nightshade family. Mushroom should not be eaten raw, can cause fungus in liver. Asparagus - cook it. Tooth therapy to keep teeth from falling out: swiss / cheddar / monterey jack, clove of garlic, slice of onion, and a little parsley. Then drink a little aloe vera juice or chew it with it.</p>
<p>Adano00_Solar3Q3NW2 - Trace minerals for kidney time, iodine working in both shut organs. In the middle of the day (from pumpkin seeds), at night (seaweed). Sea salt also has natural iodine. Selenium, iodine, zinc, and chromium. Zinc and chromium are in the same color spectrum with mercury and nickel. People with mercury fillings usually both people in the evening (6:30 PM). If you have a tooth problem, swiss / cheddar / monterey jack slice with clarified butter, garlic, and honey, and aloe vera and parsley. Copper affects spleen and heart. Gold / silver affects the small intestines. Arthritis comes from clogging of small intestine. If you eat meat, then put hot sake over it to take out the uric acid and reduce the arthritic condition. Marine life oils neutralizes the condition from animal fat and reduces arthritis. Aluminum is found in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It is also a trauma mostly for men and these are men who have been promised a retirement plan and just prior they lost it. Real mental trauma. The brain would not accept failure. Most of these people went into a shock pattern. 10 If you are focusing on a goal, then you are going to be let down. If you are focusing on the process, then you don&rsquo;t worry about what happens tomorrow. 9 times out of 10, it is the person punching the clock that has the problem. The more you cater to the process you will stay healthy to take care of your obligations. The process holds up itself. The trace minerals have another condition that we need to know. Taking it in a liquid form is better than other forms. Body toddy is the most natural source. Iron and Vitamin C go together very well. Tomato juice and molasses have this combination (in the afternoon). In the trace minerals you will also find opposite the organ there is a trace mineral setup to correct a problem in that organ. Lead is opposite to the spleen in thyroid area and the spleen has arsenic so if you phase down arsenic, you would need a trace mineral containing the opposite, lead. The final food that would compensate, a nighttime food such as ginseng or fotea (sp?) that would phase down arsenic or aluminum. Your major trace mineral is iodine, so as long as you keep iodine up, the other trace minerals can&rsquo;t have an effect. 20 Diabetics need to take a lot of trace minerals to stabilize, such as thyroid trace minerals. The bulk of people are hyper, not hypo, so they need something to slow down. Yogis have mastered the understanding of breath from umbilical to breathless state (not breath-free). That is the purpose of meditation, is to feel, holistically / osmotically integrating the oxygen. So they call it cosmic consciousness, able to see in all dimensions. Totally oxygenated, from head to toe, all the time by an osmotic process. Nitrogen moves the muscle, hydrogen creates the desire, nitrogen gives you the willpower to stick it out, oxygen let&rsquo;s you observe it. So you observe yourself craving to stick things out. You have carbon dioxide as a residue build up. It was a value at one level and a threat at another level. It will refrigerate you and preserve you or it can over refrigerate you and traumatize you. Less air is called the breathless state, from the nostril to the skin. The trace minerals are the transporters, working osmotically under the skin. You have the 12 basic minerals, the basic geometry. Yogananda used to pray to learn to live on cosmic frequencies, less and less on the solids and liquids. 30 Fasting causes the body to breath slower and tingle. In meditation, when you close your eyes you are trying to sense cellular osmotic absorption in your body. You can feel it like a tingle. 32:22 So here we have the right to eat on time by the light, the right to eat by lunar because of the pressure, and the right to eat anytime and bless it. But don&rsquo;t eat anytime and don&rsquo;t bless it because it will muck you up. (Comment from a student, &ldquo;But Therese Neumann knew the physics.&rdquo;) The thing is this, you learn the physics not from a school or a book process. After working with your body it becomes so obvious that they puzzle, &ldquo;where did you get your knowledge?&rdquo; You begin to see the phenomena is working through you. Your mind begins to zero in on it and then if you want to go validate it because you suddenly discover this wealth of awareness of yourself, you will find that most of the data is written in some book, but never put down in a way to comprehend it. So they are actually experiencing that today now. Adano explains Physician - Heal thyself as &ldquo;Physics I Can - Heal Self.&rdquo; You are the can that contains the physics and through your I-ness you can correct the flow of these elements in the cell and the osmotic approach is the direct interaction with the timing. Timing of iodine, stored in the thyroid. 40 Spitting when you get really mad so you don&rsquo;t have to swallow the enzymes. Then it will start sweeting up if you leave the mouth open and shake it up, then swallow it. We are getting more to understand the physics of ourselves. Working on people based on colors, but working on them at the right time of day. First take the age and go back. Age 35 equals 8 years, what happened at that time of life. Adano tells the story of his trauma at two years old. Individuality is god&rsquo;s costume. We are the individuality as the form or geometry, and we provide this entertainment for the unified field as the breath, the unified principle. The breath is the unified principle, outside / inside as oxygen all over the place. The one that creates awareness, not intellect, consciousness is like a camera, it records and plays back. The consciousness is universal. 50 If it is occurring in a mature body, it would be more indicative in the geometry. Mediation is a means to look at the thing more maturely. The more you correct it yourself, you are operating more efficiently. You are not avoiding mistakes, situations are opportunities to learn how to make a mistake, not to make a mistake, and not to feel threatened by not or making a mistake. Freeing the mechanism from  making preconceived assessments of a situation and getting locked into it. The moment you are working with determines what you are going to do. Adano explains the recent Chinese &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo; Then they have to discuss or a coup is the next stage. This is how the human brain is setup. 30 years to muck up, then the rest of the years are recycling years: 31 is a 4, 32 is a 5, etc. Adano tells more about his traumas a child, then falling off the building in 1955 as a way of working out early traumas. The body knows to correct itself if we allow it.</p>
<p>Adano00_SolarAtHoustonClinicQ1 - The first rule of Solar Nutrition is a little of anything is medicine for your system, too much is toxic. I will underline anything and toxic. And the person responsible for this statement is a guy called Confucius. The only problem with it is that a little for you is not a little for me, each person&rsquo;s little is different so we can&rsquo;t trust the word little, we have got to me more specific in terms of measurement. That&rsquo;s how come we find out research goes on today, what &ldquo;little&rdquo; fits everybody. So we can&rsquo;t say a little will work, we have to be more specific, if is a gram, milligram, or half a gram or whatever it is. That&rsquo;s what makes it work. 2:00 The second rule, there is a time, a place, and a season for everything and I am going to underline time, place, and season. The time has to do with your health. Your whole body is regulated by time. There is no way you can get around the timing when it comes to health. What you eat and when you put it in keeps you health, but when you put it in is more important. The place also regulates your pocketbook, if you are in the wrong place you will go broke. You can do anything you like, but you won&rsquo;t make it and in the right place, everybody wants to give it to you so that&rsquo;s evidence of fact. So they say &ldquo;go west young man&rdquo; and &ldquo;go east young lady.&rdquo; The man goes west and he&rsquo;s a cowboy and the woman goes east and she is in the chorus line. If you go north or south you may get stuck so it depends where you want to go, but that&rsquo;s the place. And the season, there is no such thing as season, there are conditions of nature so zero degrees moving forward to 32 degrees is a condition called winter, 32 degrees moving forward to 75 degrees is a condition you call spring, 75 degrees moving forward to 100 degrees plus is a condition they call summer, 100 degrees plus moving backward to 75 degrees is a condition called indian summer, 75 degrees moving backward to 32 degrees is a condition they call fall / autumn, and 32 degrees moving back to zero is a condition called winter. 7:15 The third rule is &ldquo;live to eat to get sick.&rdquo; See, that&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way. If you don&rsquo;t eat to get sick, you don&rsquo;t appreciate nature. You would be very egotistical and bombastic. So nature has rules and laws designed to make you respect her. One, there is only a certain length you can stretch you leg before she will snap it. There is only a certain amount of food you can put in your tummy before she busts it. There is only a certain type of food you can put in there before you vomit it. She is very smart so she knows how to make you sick. When you like to show off and put it in and think you can outdo nature with your mind, but nature runs your body. She doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot what kind of mind you got. Mind over matter, that&rsquo;s a bunch of baloney. It used to work years ago, but it don&rsquo;t work no more. Because why? You think you got a big mind, you are going to prove yourself and then your body lets you down and they bury you. 10 Live to eat not to get sick. Then it gets boring and you eat to get sick again. So the fifth rule is &ldquo;live to eat in order to live not to eat.&rdquo; A caterpillar is doing that, eating its way to a cocoon, then a creature comes out that can fly, a butterfly. &ldquo;Of all the creatures that can fly, there is none more beautiful than the butterfly.&rdquo; Butterflies do not rot and that principle is locked up in your body. Eating is a method to prepare you to live without eating. Because you &ldquo;process&rdquo; food and not &ldquo;eat&rdquo; it, you have to go to the bathroom. Don&rsquo;t confuse the mass you put into your mouth and the mass that came out as being evidence that you ate the food. The mineral contact of the biggest food wouldn&rsquo;t fit into the tip of a pinhead. You have 30 years to muck up, 30 years to clean up, then the rest of the years are yours. Three score ten is the transition time (70 years) to living on direct energy. Direct energy is sound waves which is breathing. 20 Mastodons carry their babies until they are 93 and lives 900 years, turtles live 100 years. Dinosaurs take 1,000 years to hatch. Moses took the scarab design off the walls of the pyramids. Early human left this design on the pyramid walls to remind people of their origins. The human body is a time traveler designed like a spaceship, but something was missing. It only showed the calcium distribution, but they left off the ambulators. From the top of the skull to sternum is the first layer of calcium formation (Zone 1), the second is from the sternum to the top of the pubic bone which is the lumbar region (Zone 2), and then from the lumbar to the anus or coccyx is the third (Zone 3). These regions are synchronous and Carl Jung is the first man to recognize this when he said the archetype is the pattern that sets the blueprint for the life form. You need the five requirements to stay healthy in your body: protein, carbohydrate, mineral / vitamin, liquid / water, lipid / oil. Needed for every meal in each of the three light zones. After high school you have to stand on your own two feet. From 18 - 30 years you can &ldquo;muck it up,&rdquo; the oriental calendar rat to the pig. 30 Each light zone must have Vitamin C and relate to the types of sicknesses. If you have a chest cold, tomatoes for lunch. Vitamin C in the morning is orange. Solar Nutrition is broken down into two functions: 21 days before the full moon = The Solar Cycle then three days before the full moon, the full moon, three days after the full moon = The Lunar Cycle. To summarize Adano: Three days before the full moon &ldquo;move the clock forward&rdquo; Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch. Three days after the full moon Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast. 40 &ldquo;Automatic, cruise-o-matic, cleanup.&rdquo; On full moon day anything goes. The reason it works is because of the pressure of the moon on the earth and you go to the bathroom quicker. The next thing you need to know is your blood type. A and AB can be 100% fiber eater, total vegetarian. B and O can be 100% tissue eater, meat eater. But nature didn&rsquo;t intend us to be 100% anything. Yogananda said that he was a &ldquo;proper eatarian.&rdquo; To stay healthy, you have to be 80% alkaline (fiber-fruits and nuts, vegetables, grain, etc.) and 20% acid (tissue, fish, eggs, etc.). Too much of either can make you sick. The balance between the two can make you healthy. The best tissue is the lamb which has the least toxic. 50 The cow and the pig are very toxic when they are killed. The lamb&rsquo;s blood before getting killed is toxic and after it is not toxic. &ldquo;Lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world.&rdquo; The deer is good also (for the hunter). Night time tissue is fish and egg. Male and female are worms and eggs. Male sperm is the worm and female has eggs. The egg ate the worm. A person with arthritis can eat lamb, fish, and eggs and get rid of it. You must know your blood type. Litmus (nitrazine) paper under the tongue. 6.5 to 7.5 is normal. Below 6 too acid, above 7.5 you are too alkaline. Acid person has a runny nose, full of mucus, always spitting up mucus, tongue is white and coated, hacking cough, and skin cracks with a yellow fluid coming out, and you ache. Also can have red spots on skin. Alkaline person has a pink, cracking tongue, dry cough, skin is very dry, cracks without fluid. Alkaline cancer is possible. When you are eating on time, you are alkaline. Melissa Wolf gives people a kinesis test. 60 Eating it and blessing it when you don&rsquo;t know is the saving grace offered by Jesus. But when you do know, you don&rsquo;t abuse it, you utilize the correct knowledge and if you have to use it outside the cycle, then you bless it. 1:05 Tape changes and Adano leaves, talking in the restaurant where they get pie. 1:10 Adano talking over breakfast to Roger Warden and a couple other people. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with the positive, the negative is powerful too. Anytime you slip back into the negative, you are going to get it, full blast. If you correct the positive with your mouth, what do you think you are going to do with the negative? The days of the play is over my friend. You are a passenger no more, you are the driver. Planet earth and the sun has moved in the last 20 years around Alpha Centauri therefore what you will be saying in the next 11-12 years will be crystallizing both positive and negative, faster and faster. In 15 years, Adano will be 80 (so since Adano was born in 1924, this implies that this tape was done in 1989). It&rsquo;s physics, it&rsquo;s not devil, it&rsquo;s laws of physics. That machine (the video tape recorder) was put together by physics. (In the video, Adano looks into the tape and looks through time.). Cooperation and doing it &ldquo;their way.&rdquo; Then tape changes again. nighttime now and people are talking over dinner. 1:20 Adano tells the story that he was born while his parents house was burning down. Miscellaneous conversation. Somebody chanting Nityananda Guru, Om Guru. Prismer music. Roger Warden tells the story of going to the dumpster at 3 AM and throwing away his smoking material. Adano says &ldquo;What are you worried about, you don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo; 1:30 (Somebody says that tomorrow they go on savings time, so the day must be April 1, 1989). More miscellaneous conversation. 1:33 What Jesus said was fact, &ldquo;but the Father in me doeth everything.&rdquo; That includes the thinking and your holding on to what you think you need and even what you think is your breath, that is His still. He is teaching you to be receptive and stop trying to run the show and enjoy the show, but he has given individuality and because he has done this, individuality is a freedom that allows you to kill yourself. That&rsquo;s why there are only three tests, kill to eat, kill yourself if you don&rsquo;t like it, or try to possess everything to be on top of everybody. That are the three tests that Jesus mastered in the desert. More miscellaneous discussion over a meal. The oxygen is pushed into us between 14.6 and 14.7 psi. The Russians and the Americans are getting ready to go to Mars so they will have to share their knowledge to do it. We have the launch power and they have the ability to keep &ldquo;the internal contents&rdquo; functioning better. 1:40 Big executives must have one hour twice a day in anti-stress rooms by using sound and light waves to deactivate the stress. Breath-less does not imply slow, it implies less repetition with longer pause between inhale and exhale. It is being done to you. Breath-free is not Breath-less. Breath-less is a condition of less repetition with longer pause in between. The period begins to run longer and the quantity per minute is reducing to compensate. Napoleon only breathed four times a minute. He thought it was a disease, it was an asset. But he did have some kind of problem that made him a tyrant, a dictator, imbecile, like Hitler. 1:45 God has a strange way to use a human body to make it stand out among society to mold it. We wouldn&rsquo;t have England today and other parts of the world if there was no Napoleon to mold it. It would stay in a corner and hide itself, but because Napoleon came along and did lots of things and forced the Russians to be somewhat more independent, so these were necessary things. Prana Yama was the old agricultural language based on compulsive guilt. We have to move onto what it is actually doing to the human being and what was it for in the first place. 1:50 Society fools itself by trying to make everybody equal, so the process was setup for individualistic realization / freedom because the Creative Intelligence has no intention of going out of business before midnight eternity. No master answers questions for the masses, it is for the specific individual&rsquo;s life frequency. It doesn&rsquo;t apply to a group, only to the person asking the question. What is all the knowledge in all the books compared with 15 minutes silence in yourself. But you cannot find an S-E-L-F, it don&rsquo;t exist, but you can discover 15 minutes silence, that is no electromagnetic static action in the cell. Which gives the experience of looking (Adano gives darshan), where everything is about to get transparent. And you think you are getting schizophrenic. They call it Darshan, full sight, and it is oxygen. (Adano demonstrates). Story about Yogananda going into the body of the soldier who got shot. Story about Trailanga Swami from Autobiography of a Yogi. Discussion of Prana Yama breathing. Prana means life and Yama means conscious relationship, not control. Consciously relating to the oxygen around you. Feel it, let is go through your skin and travel through your body. (train goes by with horn blowing and Adano is giving Darshan) Even the train is telling you. Now can you draw the energy of that sound into your body and feed yourself (Adano does it). That sound just gave me enough energy to go back to work without having to eat. Now you are recognizing what I am talking about. Don&rsquo;t try to steal the air. Feel the oxygen on the skin. Now you notice that your breakfast has all gone out of your body. Anytime you burp you are getting rid of the traumas. Let your eyes get oxygen. Now you notice the feeling is very clear, very centered, there is no stiffness.</p>
<p>Adano00_SolarQ3NW1 - Iron from the prune, iron from the almonds, piece of kiwi or peach. Kiwi is higher than vitamin C than orange. Almond will bond with citrus vitamin C. These all grow in Zone 1. The organs in Zone 1 are very important, especially the lungs, the preferential organ. 3:30 You need a little acid and you need a little alkalinity to be healthy. It is not 100% acid and it&rsquo;s not 100% alkaline, it is 80/20, you have to have the balance. That&rsquo;s one of the emphasis of macrobiotics, the acid / alkaline tone because modern science is hammering it away because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so obvious in the chemistry, but the time again regulates its beneficial results. The kiwi has more vitamin c than the black cherry. The kiwi and black cherry will absorb iron into the blood, but doesn&rsquo;t have citric acid to phase off the mucous. Citrus phases down quicker. If you are running a race, start the race drinking apple juice for malic acid, but then the lactic acid builds up, so you have to switch into a citrus juice that will phase down the lactic acid. Adano tells the story of the runner who kept losing races until Adano told him what to switch to orange juice in the second lap of the race. The sugar content of the citrus fruit is like &ldquo;high octane.&rdquo; 10 I had to prove it to myself first. The minerals and vitamins are brought into the body by the fruit, especially the skins and seeds, but then it is the oil. In the morning, get the three vitamins A, B, and C (most). C is the anti-toxin vitamin. Need to know what the vitamin C is made from. Corn Vitamin C can cause a clogged up stomach. Acerola cherries (best) or rose hips are the best &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; vitamin C. Don&rsquo;t just take the pills, has to mix with the saliva. I prefer to eat six meals a day, a small bowl of nuts, prunes, kiwi, cherries carries you through from 7-9. Then 10-12 you have orange juice as vitamin C backup, but also hormone balancers since we also run on hormones, not just food. Folgers coffee, not Maryland Club, mountain grown, one cup only with a teaspoon of Hershey&rsquo;s baking cocoa and maple syrup to sweeten. These three, taken around 10 AM is the hormone balancer. Take it in at spleen time for blood sugar regulation. Spleen and pancreas are interrelated. Hyperglycemia people have high blood pressure. Get irritable at spleen time. Hypoglycemic people have low blood pressure and get sleepy at that time. Hyper type can get diabetic, hypo type can get hypoglycemic. The cocoa comes from a cocoa bean, the coffee comes from a coffee bean, when they come in contact, the caffeine has no effect when mixed with maple syrup. A heart attack is lack of oxygen. (if they die at 1 PM in the afternoon). It can also be a lack of carbon dioxide. (because of gall bladder, if they die at a quarter to 1 AM in the morning).

<p>Adano00_StatementofLoveQ1NW1 - Saints and Sages of all religions. Brother Jesus, be though present and bless this meditation and open the hearts of these loved ones, free their lives from all obstacles, and bless them with the physical, mental, and spiritual unfoldment and may thy love shine in the sanctuary of their hearts. Bring them from the darkness to the light, ignorance to the truth, bondage to freedom, the impractical to the practical, the unconsciousness to the conscious. Release within them peace that passeth all understanding, Om, Shanti, peace. Repeat, Om. Adano does each 3x with people repeating after him Om coccyx, Om sacral, Om lumbar, Om dorsal, Om cervical, Om medulla, Om master, Om christ, Om master, Om medulla, Om cervical, Om dorsal, Om lumbar, Om sacral, Om coccyx, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, etc. 8 Godliness is practicalness, you will discover that for yourself. That&rsquo;s why this gathering today is not a religious gathering and the friends that have invited me here are friends. I love you, but I&rsquo;m not in love with you because to be in love is to fall out of love and then I&rsquo;ll blame myself for making the mistake, but to love you, we have a wonderful relationship, wonderful communion, very unending, very rewarding. That&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Adano00_TucsonQ4NW1 - The aging process is the inoperative behavior of the structure on time. Time is the distance light crossed the width of an electron, therefore the unit of time is measurable by action, conductance divided by resistance. We function in a time process, but we carry a ruler to keep track of it, it is called a watch. You are a light process and the rhythms of your light process are set. Transformation of carbon into the diamond and alchemy. Alchemy means &ldquo;all the elements&rdquo; but it built a philosophical structure to describe the mechanics of the 144 elements. But that label is not appropriate for today&rsquo;s time because it carries with it a sense of guilt. Chemistry doesn&rsquo;t have guilt, but the same laws and 144 elements are there. The reaction time is what we are dealing with constantly. If you are lead, you feel guilty that you are not gold. Al-mond means all the world, the 12 basic minerals that make the human body as a food, the most complete food. The physical body is in three rates of acceleration, the chemical rate, electrical rate, and the magnetic rate and they are all setup with chemistry. That&rsquo;s why solar nutrition takes food into the mechanism on time. We came to this country because we didn&rsquo;t have anything and our self enterprising nature pushes us forward. 10 Whenever a scientist makes a breakthrough in data concerning his environment, he is going to have to alter language from a guilt level to a non-guilt level, from a generalized level to a specific level, and no one is going to like him. 10 But if he doesn&rsquo;t freak out, he might be an asset to society. Ancient people used certain techniques to break away from environmental programming like mantra or repetition. What they are trying to get at is integrative part of your beingness where the creative reservoir is functioning totally unlimited like a fountain of youth inside of you. Freemen or lord of your cells. Adano sings, &ldquo;enjoy yourselves, it&rsquo;s later than you think, enjoy yourselves, you&rsquo;re never going to be pink, the years go by, they&rsquo;re always full of drink, enjoy yourself before they stink.&rdquo; This is nature&rsquo;s greatest contribution to creation, but it is taking us time to come to grips with it. We are moving out of churchianity into human dignity which is called spirituality. Churchianity had to mold itself from primal consciousness, from its agrarian heritage it was valid, but it isn&rsquo;t valid when it breeds sickness in the form of guilt. We have to come to grips with the reality that we are beings here for the purpose of expressing creativeness and therefore it is taking the laws of physics and chemistry to break away from that all inclusive frame, to let us look at ourcells for the first time without fear. I have one mantra, it is called Maha Asana, I will demonstrate it for you. Adano demonstrates. You see it, you heard it, it is called standing on your two feet. Delta has two functions, the first function of delta is this, Adano snores, the other state of delta is to get up and function and the moment of function is the moment of contribution. You are applying practicality. Delta doesn&rsquo;t have anything to offer other than to release, it releases what you have. It is the non ego level. Deep down inside of us is the urge to do something constructive. We are programmed to feel unworthy, once you begin phasing that off and begin to look at yourself actually the way you are constructed, free men or lord of your cells (yourselves). Delta is the observer, you paid the money for the movie to come on the screen. Yogananda story about seeing himself on the battlefield being shot in the chest. We have this phenomena going on in us because we are an expression of light. 20 The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second and the earth is 8000 miles in diameter. Adano explains carbon dioxide and oxygen and how it links everybody together with the speed of light squared. 22:22 Paul came to the final realization that the miracles were not the essential purpose of life, understanding the truth is the real purpose of living, how to function in a guilt free state. So he said &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing, for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; Meaning he was able to phase in and phase out on the cosmic tape called oxygen that produces the phenomena called consciousness or identity which made the intimacy of self beingness, worthiness now, the greatest joy. That was his rejoicing for the first time. He was rejoicing in self beingness. Whenever you do something that doesn&rsquo;t please the parent, they are going to remind you that you faltered. After awhile you get a sense of worthiness or unworthiness. But deep down inside, unworthiness also exists when the sperm are released to the ovum. You don&rsquo;t know if you are going to be a winner because nobody asked you to run the race. The struggle goes into the biological memory banks to determine the willingness to survive. You wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in this room if you weren&rsquo;t a winner. Adano explains twins and siamese twins as two sperms who did not slow down sufficiently to dock with the ovum. The creator has to put himself in all these different individual mechanic to test the love. Why is he testing love? Because he is endowing the creation with love. He creates us. We are created in this process and love is the principle that drives it to create therefore it has to endow the creation with love and give it a sense of worthiness, but a sense of worthiness is never appreciated unless there is a sense of competitiveness. You see it. You can&rsquo;t have a front without a back, a top without a bottom. This is a necessary means to develop immunity to cope with the environment. 30 So every law of nature is well worked out. We have to come out and live it at the intellectual level and assess it with the intellect. So you need your intellect, your programming, to evaluate the biological laws. Here is another mantra at the intellectual level, &ldquo;prayer unceasingly.&rdquo; Breath is only prayer because it makes a sound in the inhalation and exhalation called So Hung, Adano snorts. &ldquo;I am that,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the sonics resonating in the nostril with the incoming / outgoing air.&rdquo; When you begin to understand the truth behind it, you have to live the mantra by breathing. You disengage from the childlike behavior and get into the actual mechanics to live now. The mantra phases down beta to give you control in alpha, then it phases down the alpha to disengage you from the discordant geometry that is not stored correctly by memory tissue. You may say something and not take full note of it and that&rsquo;s where you have the responsibility for the actions. Repetition is an ingrained process for discipline. You can also chant or shout it or maybe mentally think it. Each individual finds his own idiosyncrasy, like Frank Sinatra, &ldquo;I did it my own way.&rdquo; You must find what is intimate to your nature and apply it. You will get the same result in the end, that is the delta level, totally devoid of geometry, alphabet, and numerals, and the strength of the inner consciousness. That is the level you are heading to. The paths are many, but the truth and the experience is still the same. Then you have to get up and live it.</p>
<p>Adano00_UmarkedQ3NW1 - Holding the little finger up while drinking tea is &ldquo;wearing their love on their sleeve.&rdquo; That connects to the heart, they are very vain people and controls the small intestine, they don&rsquo;t eat too much. Gap in tape. This finger controls circulation, sex drive, and elimination. Now this finger controls the lungs. Body language is already preset is already indicating how these forces are working inside. 2:20 We are so close to the experience of oneness if we can just program the mind to work with simple techniques. The oriental people have learned it so they use a candle, or they use a picture, or they use a photograph, something to center. And you say &ldquo;I want to merge with the Master.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the common term you use? &ldquo;I want to be one with the Master?&rdquo; It is the same as saying I want to be one with the little flashlight. The image has nothing to do with the inner experience. The inner experience is a bridge between the physiological will and the psychological will in order to experience omnipresence which is a sense of oneness or at-one-ment. This is also a feeling of outside-ness of your body. Yet you are never really outside. Because outside of where? You have always been outside, but you were looking down and trying to hold onto this, calling this the reality, but when you break the illusion of the psychological level and see that &ldquo;hey you&rsquo;ve been free all these years and never knew you were free,&rdquo; but dreams are the only way to help you to remember that you are free and most people get dreams that they are always traveling someplace, flying someplace. This is to remind you that you have always been outside. So don&rsquo;t block them, the idea is to recapture them and start focusing them. Adano explains physiological will and the psychological will based on Hatha yoga postures. 10 Adano tells the story of the composer who can see the energy flowing up the body. Adano explains the flows of energy in the body and the alpha machine. Long silent periods in tape while Adano demonstrates techniques to people. Sounds like Margaret is talking about the elemental song and singing it 16 times for all the elementals in combination. 20 Margaret fumbling around with the relationships between the elementals, interrupting Adano. Adano explains pressure in the body pulling downward and upward on the colon. Ascending colon not flushing lung and large intestine to block up. Descending colon not flushing causes spleen, liver, and stomach to block up. It has to be kept clean.</p>
<p>Adano00_Xmas_CosmicConsciousnessQ1NW1 - Adano gives a talk with an organ in the background. Come, let us pray with the deepest devotion of our souls, Om Brahma, Om Vishnu, Om Shiva, etc. Our beloved Jesus Chris, Supreme Master Babaji, Great Master Lahiri Mahasaya, Master Swami Sri Yukteswarji, our beloved guru Paramahansaji Yogananda, and the saints and sages of all religions, we bow to thee all. May the Light of Christ Consciousness flow through us as it has manifested in thy life. Open the doors of consciousness that we may perceive in this incarnation the universal christ consciousness throbbing within our hearts. Bless us that we understand the truth and feel thy love and may thou love shine on the sanctuary of thy devotion that we may awaken this love in all hearts. Om, Christ, Gurus. 0:05 Good evening folks, we are gathered here tonight, myself, Sonny, and Al to wish you a Merry Christmas. At the same time to participate in group meditation. I would like you to join us and commune with Christ. 6 I want to tell you something very important tonight and that is how to see the beloved Jesus within ourselves. You may ask, how do you see a person? The answer is the eye. The eye is constructed like a camera. It has a dark chamber, a lens through which light is admitted, and a sensitive plate through which the light acts. In the human eye, the sensitive plate is the retina. Light acting on photo sensitive chemical substances in the retina creating impulses that are transmitted to the brain which interprets them as visual images. When you hear a sound, it too is converted into touch. You not only hear, but you feel it also as vibratory sensation. Similarly, light does not go into the brain as light, but acts on the photosensitive cells of the retina. The result is a chemical stimuli activating nerve impulses that travel to the brain and are converted there into mental images having form, line, and color. The retina is actually a thin out pocketing of the brain around which the eye has formed. In fact, when you see a person, you are not seeing him, but a photographic image. The power of vision is in the brain, but if the brain is anesthetized, you cannot see anything. Even when you become absent minded, your brain does not respond to the impulses coming into it from the retina. You are unaware of outer happenings. Many years ago, our guru Parahansaji, when he was a young boy, happened to be in a state of Samadhi or divine ecstasy. His uncle was so alarmed that his uncle struck him in an effort to arouse him. Master heard him saying &ldquo;what is the matter with you? I struck you three times, but you did not respond.&rdquo; Master was so deep in concentration, he had no bodily sensations. His mind was so focused on god that all sensory perception of his uncle&rsquo;s presence and his slaps failed to register. 10 We seen then that we must have some form of contact and that is where the eyes are important. The eyes act as a two way camera. It photographs images from the outer world and also images from the subconscious and superconsciousness realms, the electrical nature. Our waking mind or conscious mind, reacts to retinal impressions. Observing images, objects, persons, that are in line with the vision. How then may a person see Jesus? This is the question tonight. We who have lived and have read of Jesus who has lived thousands of years ago would like to perceive him, not as a mental image, but the body of Jesus and the bodies of all saints who have lived on this earth plane and were immortalized in Cosmic Consciousness, God. It is possible and the Great Ones can appear before us anytime. 11:30 More so tonight, which is dedicated to Jesus. 12 How do such visions occur? There is a definite science to it. The technique is to focus your eyes at the Christ Center in the forehead between the eyebrows. When your eyes are upturned in this way, you shutoff the awareness of outer lights. Gradually, slowly, you will begin to see another light. This light is of a bluish color. Where does that light come from? It is the astral light of the brain, the electrical nature of man, that issues from the pineal eye or gland and the medulla oblongata. And that is reflected in your spiritual eye in the center of the forehead. This is the single eye of which Jesus spoke of when he said &ldquo;if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&rdquo; As you gaze at the point between the eyebrows slowly focusing the mind and thinking of Jesus, we will begin to see that it takes shape. 14 Now we know, that in order to see an object with shape, light is necessary. One cannot see in the dark, therefore all Saints saw in visions in a state of light, not physical, but astral light. It is necessary to shut of your physical vision first. To achieve success, the half open eyes have to be concentrated at the christ center. In order to see the astral light, you must focus your eyes at the astral center, calmly, without strain, relaxed, with deep concentration and devotion and in that astral eye you evoke the image of Jesus. Our Guru has seen Jesus many times. Jesus has olive skin and dark brown, his nose if flattened at the tip, his mustache, hair, and sparse beard are black. Keep your whole attention on that light in the spiritual eye. Don&rsquo;t try to visualize his appearance, but silently generate the thought at the point between the eyebrows mentally saying, &ldquo;please come to me&rdquo; and continue with devotion, &ldquo;please come to me.&rdquo; From that cosmic source, that light of god will materialize around you. He will first come to you as a small image and as your power becomes stronger, it takes on the full form. 20 When you open your eyes fully, the vision will vanish. You will have to try harder to see him when the eyes are open. These experiences are tremendous, but can be only achieved with your deepest desire and love. So meditate until you make contact. The blessings of the guru and the grace of god is with us tonight. If you don&rsquo;t see Christ right away, you will feel him. 25 I have been telling you this whole evening about Jesus and how to contact Him, but what is more important is the object of communion with the Christ Consciousness. For centuries, from Jerusalem to India, this earth plane has been hallowed by great souls who have all brought the same one message to us, that is the message of Self Realization, the Christ Intelligence which manifests throughout vibratory creation. A person cannot know of Jesus merely by reading a book on theology, scriptures, he must feel the presence of Jesus in deep meditation, he must have an experience of Christ Consciousness throughout vibratory creation. We must learn to seek this spiritual solace in the inner, immortal temple. 27 Let us enlarge the cup of our consciousness so that the Christ Consciousness can fill us and quench our Soul thirst. As we behold the Christ Consciousness in all individuals, families, races, creatures, we must finally experience Him in the spinal Christmas tree of the bodily temple. There we will discover the Star of Wisdom, the omnipresent Ever New Joy, the Cosmic Sound, Cosmic Light, Cosmic Vibration, Cosmic Wisdom, and Cosmic Love. Every year and every moment, the Christ is recognized in Cosmic Consciousness and the angelic beings all celebrate this glorious manifestation. Let us now celebrate this Christ Consciousness in our own meditation. Let us prepare the Christmas tree of the spine and let us place the eternal gifts on this beautiful spinal tree. The gift of eternal consciousness life, unconditional love, unattachment, service, understanding, self control, and self surrender. And as we place these gifts on the spinal column of the great cosmic Christmas tree, we behold the Cosmic Christ Consciousness permeating us in a golden, blue white light, flowing through us and around us and may this Consciousness lift us up that we be living examples of these glorious gifts and as we permeate our consciousness, not the physical body of Jesus, but the glorious Christ Consciousness that is in all creation, we will then participate of these glorious gifts that we feel in the spinal Christmas tree in the bodily temple. Om, Christ, Gurus. 30 Oh beloved Jesus, I surrender my ego to thy consciousness. May thy blessing flow through me to all these holy ones. As I touch them on their forehead, my thy blessing flow to them, granting them permanent Christ Consciousness in this bodily temple. And may they feel thy presence and behold the many masters who have made us conscious of thy presence. And may we live in this glorious consciousness and participate with this blessing. We thank thee. Om, Christ, Gurus. Adano stops for a moment, gap in tape. 37 Somebody else talking 40 Adano tells the story of Yogananda&rsquo;s life. Babaji, the Supreme Master and Avatar made this statement years before Yogananda was born. &ldquo;I see that you are interested in the West as well as the East.&rdquo; &ldquo;East and West must establish a golden middle path of activity and spirituality combined. We have much to learn from the West in material development and much to give in universal methods to the West in order for them to base their religious beliefs. You Swamaji have a part to play in the coming harmonious exchange between the East and the West. Some years hence I will send you a disciple whom you can train for Yoga dissemination in the West. The vibrations where of many spiritually seeking souls come flood like to me. I perceive potential saints in America and Europe waiting to be awakened.&rdquo; You see Master&rsquo;s life was preicted way before in a conversation between Supreme Master Babaji and Sri Yukteswar. Story about Yogananda praying for approval to go the West. Babaji came and gave him approval. This is all in Autobiography of a Yogi. gap in tape then somebody else talking. 50 Still somebody else talking. 60 Adano talking again. Beloved Master, perceive this great Cosmic Experience by gazing on the Supreme Master Babaji. Now, Master himself craved this experience to be a permanent thing within himself. Sri Yukteswar bestowed the divine experience of Cosmic Consciousness. The divine experience does not come by intellectual willingness or open mindedness. It descends through the enlargement of the consciousness and by devotion and through the natural inevitability of a divine nature, the student pulls at god with irresistible force and the cosmic vision is then drawn down within the seekers range of consciousness. Adano continues with stories from Autobiography of a Yogi. 1:00 Somebody else talking, the Samadhi poem. 1:10 Adano talking from these cosmic experience that it is possible for us, the disciples to daily experience this cosmic experience. As we close our eyes and gaze at the point between the eyebrows at the Christ center, slowly expanding our consciousness and beholding the golden light, the blue, the cosmic white star radiating, feeling our presence, traveling through our entire bodies into our rooms, the four walls. Beyond the four walls expanding to the very boundaries of our community, to the boundaries of our countries, and to the boundaries of other countries, expanding throughout the entire earth. Our consciousness is expanding to other planets, stars, galaxies, the entire creation. As we behold this cosmic chalice, this cosmic holy grail being filled with the divine spirit, the divine nature. We shall drink daily as we see the cosmic light and hear the cosmic sound and feel the cosmic bliss permeating our bodies and taste the cosmic nectar in our mouths and smell the cosmic perfume. Then we know, beyond all doubt, that we too are experiencing this glorious cosmic consciousness to which the master Paramahansaji came and brought the beautiful techniques for us to experience them. We shall daily commune with our cosmic nature and drink in this holy spirit. 1:10 Adano plays Yogananda&rsquo;s voice reciting &ldquo;God, Christ, Gurus.&rdquo; Oh beloved Guru, Paramahansaji, I surrender my ego to thee. May thy blessing flow through me and through my hands and to thy beloved disciples. And may they feel thy presence when I touch them on the forehead with thy consciousness. May that consciousness flow into their consciousness and permeate them. We thank thee.</p>

<p>The Cherokee word for soul is ada:n(v)do. It’s semantic meaning, deconstructed from its root, ada nv a, indicates that someone or something is in transit, moving from place to place. This transitory vision of this mutable and mobile essence has its origins, according to Fogelson, in the aboriginal Cherokee belief that four primal animate life forces emanate from the human body.
