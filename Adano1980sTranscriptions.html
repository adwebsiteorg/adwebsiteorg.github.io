<p>Adano83_07_26FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3 - Many of us may not know too much of the meaning of Darshan and even those who are initiated sometimes have vague understanding of the word itself, the mechanics, let alone what is involved in the experience. Before we meditate the brain, before it entered the house, it&rsquo;s in a state of excitement getting here, trying to decide for the traffic, it really can&rsquo;t dip deep into the core of its structure. So at a satsang which means fellowship with truth, the individual who is the focal point who has been spending many years dipping into this potential of their nature, acts of a sort of a resonating device that lines up the alpha wave of the brain of the student so that the brain can then dip into a non-verbal state. So you feel like for a brief moment everything is suspended, there are no words coming up, you&rsquo;re in a state of expectancy but that state, that brief moment is known as Darshan, the whole sight, the devotion of heart, not of brain. There is no verbalization, the internal dialogue has temporarily suspended itself between left and right halves of the brain. Now it gives you the initiate and the word initiate simply means the individual who is going to work on their internal mechanism and has the privilege to work with it by being locked in to certain laws of nature and having prepared themselves by cleaning the body, making it less toxic, they can better resonate with their inner consciousness. In the olden days they would call that baptism and when Jesus went to John he said, &ldquo;You baptize me&rdquo; and John said, &ldquo;No you baptized me&rdquo; and picture two grown people arguing who should throw water on each other&rsquo;s head. But then he said &ldquo;Suffer it to be so for this is the way of righteousness&rdquo; which merely means relate to the inner laws by synchronicity with someone who has delved deep in to synchronize. That doesn&rsquo;t make the person superior to you or somebody pull you by the nose, it is like going to a battery charger and renovating the battery and bringing it back up to full charge so we do need these periodical encounters which is called Satsang. Now it can be in the presence of the person or in the absence of the person so we realize the form is not the connecting link, it&rsquo;s the attitude. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;suffer it to be so,&rdquo; it other words go in, suspend the internal dialogue so that the potential that you are begins to come up. Those who have never been initiated they&rsquo;ll also feel a charge that will stir them to want to know how to actually work in the detoxification and centering of themselves. It&rsquo;s a sort of an encouragement to the individual and those who have already been initiated, it&rsquo;s a reinforcement of what you call your annual carburetor tune-up, getting the machine to be more and more specific to its internal potential. So it has two advantages: one, it helps to suspend the internal dialogue that is so difficult to do being involved in living in this environment that is composed of sonics and you can&rsquo;t help talking, from the day you&rsquo;re born everybody&rsquo;s talking to you. Even when you go to bed, you&rsquo;re dreaming that someone&rsquo;s talking inside so you do need periods to suspend that dialog just to get centering. I know you may have lots of questions and answers that you&rsquo;re waiting for but before we take that as initiates, just to bring ourselves back to the important concept of our nature. One person asked &ldquo;what is the most important role as a human being?&rdquo; And this was the answer that came back from many many religious and spiritual leaders and even if you track it down historically in the writings, the importance is to realize you are an initiate of the highest consciousness, to realize that you have the tools to work with internally, scientifically to validate your true reality, and it has nothing to do with the individual or individuals who come and go, they are just the finished product. It&rsquo;s up to you to finish your job and go through the process and realize it. We pay respect to those who go ahead of us, yes, because they&rsquo;re the ones who innately sense their true potential either by sickness or some intense yearning from a previous life or because they have some function to perform while they&rsquo;re alive but whatever drives them to that research, from that moment on you&rsquo;re involved with a non-image, love for God. &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other graven image before Me.&rdquo; It is your contribution to the you in you to prove it once and for all that He became you and that&rsquo;s why they instituted initiation or baptism thousands of years ago and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what school or avenue we come from or use to get that, many roads lead to the door right here. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many roads it took to get here and I had to fly in an airplane to get here, yet I have to come through that one door, see what I mean? 0:10 The door is in the heart and that&rsquo;s how Yogananda would say &ldquo;Door of my heart open wide I keep for Thee. Wilt Thou come, wilt Thou come, just for once come to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even just once incarnation give me the living experience of my potential, restore my memory, restore my conviction of the reality that Creator has become his Creation. No longer lets me live in the conflicts or intra-polarity of the right brain and left brain. Let me center, let me have what they call peace that passes understanding.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a peace that the world gives, the world gives you six feet under the ground, it&rsquo;s called tranquility in the grave and may you rest in peace. The peace of the initiate or the Soul Potential is the strength of peace, the capacity to keep coping with daily challenges and going through them. This peace the world can&rsquo;t give us, only the Christ nature in you, the God nature in you gives you that from your self-confrontation but you need human beings to divert your attention to that point of reference. They may be called teachers or guides or Gurus, what is more important, not they, is that the student is not greater than the teacher and the teacher not greater than the student, they both got to go there. We both have to come to this door to greet each other tonight so our roles are not important, who is teacher and who is student, what is important we are initiates of the Spirit. We are initiated into the Spirit to find our own potential, we are baptized, we are brought into the inner contact devoid of outer trappings, devoid of outer images. We start off our early growth by relating to images and finally we mature into the one real temple because Creative Life lives in it. One of the hardest things in this process is to know another human being can hurt you after you&rsquo;ve done things for them, what would generate compassion from your heart for them? Yet a parent has to generate compassion for his child regardless if the child does all kinds of things. So you&rsquo;re given preparation in compassionate love from the time you become a parent, let alone humanity. That is the basis of the growth of your spirituality, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking for. It&rsquo;s a non-verbal relationship, more and more it&rsquo;s the internal joyousness to release it but even teachers get angry and tear down the money changers you know and drive them out of the church saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it a gambling place.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll spank us once in a while or pull our ears and let us know &ldquo;quit your nonsense&rdquo; once in a while, get on the ball and look in at yourself, that comes occasionally. So sometimes there are a lot of dry periods in your spiritual process when you feel that you&rsquo;re left out but you&rsquo;re not. As soon as the internal dialogue suspends itself, it&rsquo;s flashing up again, the realization goes up. And that&rsquo;s why the institution or the idea came of &ldquo;when two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; This is more intended scientifically for the initiate than for the regular person who is just interested in meeting in a meditation meeting because the real communication goes on with the initiate from that standpoint with his own Christ nature. He is pulling together his Christ nature and allowing it to release its potential through this mechanism. That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;when two or three are gathered in My name,&rdquo; not in me Jesus or me Adano, it&rsquo;s when we as initiates gather into the sense of remembrance at the time of initiation, that contact it pulls and nurtures and feeds and a Darshan, or whole sight, total sight, that is the capacity to see through, not see at. It&rsquo;s a feeling that you sense when it&rsquo;s occurring like a suspension, that is the whole name, &ldquo;in My name.&rdquo; The Creative Intelligence is Sonics and we can call Him God or Father, some people call Him all types of names. American Indians call Him Great Spirit but it&rsquo;s a vibrancy that is exchanged at the human level, that makes it more important as an experience than something that has happening and there are no human beings around. It is when you meet another human being and that human being is locking into the potential and can allow this vibrancy to emanate, then you in turn, it&rsquo;s like a magnet, you become magnetized, you can now release it yourself, it works through you also. My experience came from my teacher and I give the credit to him and he will always say his came from his teacher and we all go back and say &ldquo;Okay God, You did Your thing&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s fine and good, we respect that. The important thing is that you know it works and you know it exists and it&rsquo;s not a verbal experience, it&rsquo;s a non-verbal experience of presence. Meditation is the nurturing and trying to always retain the feeling of the Darshan or the effect or the sensation that occurred during initiation. Meditation is that particular nurturing attitude to recapture it or to re-enhance it and the more you meditate, the more you&rsquo;ll re-enhance it to the extent where it starts bubbling inside of you. Put it this way, my good friend the Pentecostal minister says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need no alcohol from the bottle, I got enough alcohol going inside of me, it bubbles into champagne&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s what this sensation of the whole Spirit the whole sight is all about is that same principle. 0:20 This sensitivity of knowing that it&rsquo;s waves that suspend the verbal dialogue and allow you to feel and reach out to the memory banks of various levels of yourself. Now I know when you take a little drink you always feel like like you&rsquo;re &ldquo;out there?&rdquo; Good. As my friend would say, &ldquo;this is a natural high,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to enhance. The main goal behind that or process behind that more than a goal is a cellular transformation is occurring in you though you may not realize it at the time. As an initiate as you become more conscious and meditate, that means enhancing and trying to re-enhance that feeling and having the verbal dialogue suspending itself more and more, an immunity begins to increase. You can cut yourself it heals very fast, you can seem to deprive yourself of many things you couldn&rsquo;t do before and a gradual strength and self-confidence, a strength of peace to cope with conditions of life becomes obvious, you&rsquo;re getting stronger in yourself. You realize that and you&rsquo;re no longer running to find the happiness in secluded areas, you&rsquo;re standing on your two feet and experiencing the happiness and the peace of mind right where you are. You start out searching and running to different areas for the peace, only to return back to find it&rsquo;s already bubbling up. That is to say in the early stages of your encounter with Spirit you&rsquo;re like the grape on the vine, then initiation is like somebody plucked you off the vine and they did this to you, (laughter) and your dry spells has got to do with all this stuff here. Periodically they&rsquo;ll put this in the jar and it starts the fermentation, it&rsquo;s gonna be very tricky job too because it can be wine or vinegar, but we can&rsquo;t stop at the wine because that would be a psychic level of our growth. It&rsquo;s good, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that is called gift of Spirit but it&rsquo;s not fruit of Spirit. It is the next stage, the enhancing where Satsang is. You meet the person or they&rsquo;re not even there, the Satsang doesn&rsquo;t stop, the Satsang is going on now at a cellular level inside with eyes open or eyes shut. The verbal dialogue can be suspended now at your command, this is shifting into the champagne level. Therefore they call that Samadhi or God-realization in the waking state, the moving state, that&rsquo;s the champagne state. Wine is the non-moving state where you sit down like this and you&rsquo;re drunk with it but the moment you get up, it&rsquo;s all gone, you rush back, that&rsquo;s the wine state. So you&rsquo;re afraid to get up and move around lest the verbalizations keep rushing back in and the peace seems to get weaker but don&rsquo;t quit, just go again. And it&rsquo;s being reinforced by those who love you as in the Eye of the Cyclone written by Dr. Lilly, you&rsquo;re not without others looking on who are deeply concerned with your well-being no matter what level you&rsquo;re at, that&rsquo;s nice to know. But no matter what level you think you&rsquo;re in, there&rsquo;s always somebody watching to pull you back up and that&rsquo;s good to know that we never really can fall short of the Creative Presence. So out of sight is not out of mind, you&rsquo;re always in tune with the individual and it pulls you up so you can move from the wine stage or the non-moving stage to the champagne stage, the ever-moving stage, that&rsquo;s the purpose behind it to get you there to be your own bottle of champagne and flip out your own cork (laughter). And Darshan or Satsang is that intent, that&rsquo;s the whole intent behind it, the whole mechanics behind it is to get you the initiated grape to move on into the champagne level of yourself. That&rsquo;s the students went to Jesus and he said &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t touch your feet, you&rsquo;re not in me.&rdquo; If I don&rsquo;t make contact with you or if you don&rsquo;t see or relate or get together, there is no enhancing of (inaudible). See that&rsquo;s how for centuries Man realized that a Satsang or a group sitting down was more important than books. Books are good but books don&rsquo;t give you the level of non-verbalization, you have to sit down in the presence with loved ones and activate the memory that triggered you in the first place to be interested in yourself and feel that vibrancy permeate you and suspend the verbalization and that allows you to extend that nonverbal quality longer and longer to the extent that you can get up and walk with it. Another quality of Satsang, which is fellowship or two or three gatherings in my Name, is the exposure to transfiguration. When the disciples were with their teacher Jesus in the Garden and he asked them to pray a while with him which means to sit down and suspend the verbalization, later on one said that they saw two other great Souls standing next to the teacher: Moses and Elijah and one brave soul said, Peter, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a tabernacle or a covenant,&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll make a commitment at this point in time in our own nature to really try to suspend the verbalization so that we can have more of this exposure to the transfiguration. Transfiguration is both visual and internal, biological. You may see facial changes on the person, interposing phases of the unity of the atom and the oneness of life at the visual level. That&rsquo;s just the skin of the banana, the real banana you want to eat now let alone get the oil, comes from inside. The real eternal transfiguration is the closing of the eyes and at the portal door where all of us merge, we come through embracing you from inside then you are transfigured. 0:30 And they have only one message for you, &ldquo;We who have crossed the threshold of silence yearn for you to cross that threshold and to merge in the unity of yourself and may you be transfigured into your eternal Now. Then a strange thing will happen, when you open the eyes to look out you may not see anything for a few seconds and you&rsquo;ll wonder where you are, don&rsquo;t get scared. Having crossed the threshold of silence, you&rsquo;ve crossed the threshold of Sonics which means the Father outside of the vibratory creation. The Father as a Son, He&rsquo;s His own Son, is the Creative Intelligence in the vibratory creation of sonics, &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father but I go unto the Father,&rdquo; that came later. The realized Man goes on to the next level, he has to go on to the next level but he must experience the first level of hearing the Sonics, having an outward exposure to the transfiguring experience of physical laws, things seem to go hazy, it&rsquo;s like looking down the road on a hot day. Don&rsquo;t get scared, it&rsquo;s just natural laws going on, you&rsquo;re not hallucinating and it&rsquo;s occurring naturally within you, it&rsquo;s allowing you to have total sight into the reality. Then you&rsquo;ll cross that threshold where there is no verbalization, there is no matching, there is no language in it. For that brief moment you have crossed through there, you are with the Father then you know for sure without doubt, He became (inaudible). Ego, individuality are all left behind in the Sonic level, in the verbalization level and a collective unity of oneness is very very pronounced in your mechanism. So I can appreciate your feeling when you said &ldquo;you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;re gonna (inaudible)&rdquo; that was because you were feeling it at a sonic level in the engulfment with the water because in a strange way you survived, that intimacy of compassion plucked you to the next level and from now on you can cross the threshold and go into your Divinity. Do not be afraid of your divinity and you may admit like Saint Catherine, &ldquo;Give me back my brother Jesus&rdquo; because she sees her own self, she prefers to have someone to respect, we all do that. I myself looks to Yogananda or living teachers because one cannot really worship a total non-image even though it became you. It would be a sense of non-appreciation for those who went before you who made you conscious but whatever time they triggered that consciousness in you to recognize it. So you are no longer afraid or feel threatened by paying respect or loving adoration to the person who triggered you. That&rsquo;s how they wrote the book later on &ldquo;At the Feet of the Master&rdquo; but you don&rsquo;t see his face, you just see the foot and many Gurus have the name &ldquo;foot of God.&rdquo; A lot of these highly realized Masters, when you translate their name it&rsquo;s called paw or foot of God or the toe of God and it&rsquo;s very interesting the names that they have. It&rsquo;s no discredit to any of us, it&rsquo;s so fantastically loving, you just love it. Everyone is. If you feel to close your eyes and merge do so, if you feel to keep your eyes open do so, let presence flow. Fill yourself with presence, let your potential come to the surface, you&rsquo;re aiming for champagne. (Gap in tape). Audience: I want to hear your exposition on the enlightenment of the unmarried person, the everyday person. Adano: We use the word enlightenment but sometimes we really don&rsquo;t connect the experience, what it represents in terms of the spiritual life. In the spiritual life the enlightenment is the ability to recognize moment to moment the intrinsic timing of events occurring around you. How you as an individual is at a certain location, a certain time, and your reaction to the conditions based upon your expectancy. In the olden days they would say every action is determined by God, His will be done, but we never really can cope with it or get any experience to say that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will and if we fail we do say it&rsquo;s His will and if we win we do say it&rsquo;s His will but we never really understand what is His will in the first place in terms of the practical exposure, practical day-to-day living. So we tend to search for enlightenment as if it is going to totally eradicate all the veils of the existence. The enlightenment in the daily life and for the human being more than the ordinary  man or woman, the human being per say, in the true spiritualness is recognition of timing. Many of you drove a lot of vehicles to come here, right? Did you buy sixty five hundred dollars worth of parts or sixty five hundred dollars worth of timing? Yet in a simple rational practical existence, it&rsquo;s taken for granted until it&rsquo;s brought into focus what you really have and what you&rsquo;re really experiencing and what frees you now from guilt complex. Spirituality aims to free you from guilt in the experience and aims to let you have the enlightenment or the understanding to be correct that doesn&rsquo;t have a feedback of guilt because there is no good or bad. 0:40 Like Omar Khayyam would say &ldquo;I myself am heaven and hell&rdquo; but heaven in the sense of a haven or reservoir, hell in the sense of &ldquo;h-e-l-d,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m held back by my own inability to time myself. Nobody is holding me back, I am holding my one-self back and that is because I&rsquo;m out of time and if we look at production and production simply represents repetition, you can say &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; now, mechanical rosary, repeating over and over, Xeroxing, do you see? You&rsquo;re getting the understanding, you&rsquo;re getting the enlightenment then you&rsquo;re again recognizing that you&rsquo;re forced to synchronize with timing. That automatically liberates you from a guilt process of living that drains you off and then you feel left out and in actuality it&rsquo;s not true. The enlightenment or the freedom from, that&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;free men all, lord of yourself&rdquo; but s-e-l-f can be very misleading and can be very nebulous and very authoritative and very deistic whereas c-e-l-l, &ldquo;free men all, lord of the cell,&rdquo; lord of these cells. This is an intrinsic battery, each one of them, it&rsquo;s an intrinsic machinery, it&rsquo;s an intrinsic powerhouse, it&rsquo;s a conditioned atom. You as consciousness is in-resident in it and the interconnectedness of timing makes you more appreciative of it therefore freeing you of the guilt feedbacks as you become synchronized to its internal rhythms. The whole frontier of reality opens itself for you now in the unlimitedness of it that there is no limitation to God, it is called to the greater glory of God. To this end Jesus healed the blind man, not because of karma if he from a past life that he is born blind or the parents which is heredity but it&rsquo;s the challenge within each one of us to pull it together in the cellular structure and realize or feel and time yourself, lock into your intrinsic timing now recognized as the true will of God. Why would the Creator create to punish? He doesn&rsquo;t punish, He provides one basic law for the whole creation to function on, we know as Newton&rsquo;s first law, right? In the East we know it as karma and to the churchianistic thinking it is &ldquo;what you sow, you reap,&rdquo; and the cowboys are singing it now, (inaudible) but karma or whatever you want to call it is still centered on timing. If you look at it objectively and don&rsquo;t be swayed by its forcefulness on you, you will free the brain from the feedback of guilt and look at it as the opportunity to rise above your limitations and that is really the full enlightenment of the human being. &ldquo;To him that overcometh,&rdquo; I will do what? &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t send forth a second time.&rdquo; You see all these things are coming to have more valid meaning and possible experience. Before it would seem nebulous not when you look at it in terms of timing and when you have to live a day-to-day life of basic survival regardless of what you believe in and when the cost factor of existence tells you where it&rsquo;s at, put up or shut up, then you know timing is God&rsquo;s will in your life like it or not. It doesn&rsquo;t take away from the old traditional way of describing the sacredness of God to you, in fact it removes the weakness of it with your own self-fear of integrating with it and it imparts a strength which you never had before and that&rsquo;s the strength of peace. &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give,&rdquo; the peace that comes from within your own I AM-ness of understanding your structure. This is strength, you can live it and not feel threatened by it and to sum it up in a working behavior of enlightenment or understanding, it is acting what you say to yourself. Years ago when I came into this area and I happened to go on the reservation and I grew up hearing this statement many times when they said that the Indians accused the white man of speaking with a forked tongue and I always wanted to know what that really meant and I have a friend who I&rsquo;m going to see pretty soon and he said &ldquo;pale face speak with forked tongue.&rdquo; And I looked at my tongue in the mirror and I couldn&rsquo;t see where it was forked and then try to get their version, &ldquo;he lies, he doesn&rsquo;t convey what he means&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not really what it was. The Indian on the reservation today or in the frontier days realized that in their structural language, it was designed to act what they say. Whereas in english it&rsquo;s not so designed, one word has many different meanings and this creates a conflict when spoken to another person who is linearly conditioned to act out what he says and doesn&rsquo;t have flexibility. Then he will accuse you for being double talking and meaning different shades of the meaning and therefore you can get into all kind of wrong understandings in communication. Yet by the same token, rigid language, linear in itself can be a prison and a flexible language can be a treasure. You can restrict yourself in one word with one meaning and at the same time you can liberate yourself with that same word by having a different meaning especially if you&rsquo;re traumatized, I&rsquo;ll give you an example. For the actual layman, as you would say, looking for enlightenment moment to moment, d-o-g, now you must be thankful to english the only language you can do this with, d-o-g is man&rsquo;s best friend, agreed? You spell it backwards it&rsquo;s still the man&rsquo;s best friend. (Laughter). 0:50 Now you can&rsquo;t do that with any other language no matter how you try so we have a unique experience here by speaking english. Many nationalities can use for the first time a guilt-free communication to their internal self, it&rsquo;s very very interesting because you don&rsquo;t feel threatened no more as you begin to look at the simplicity and the naturalness of the language and the timing of the events. Years ago, I&rsquo;ll give you an example in my own life, I&rsquo;d an appointment to go to and I&rsquo;d always think I would be late so I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get there before and I&rsquo;d get worked up with the feeling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late, I don&rsquo;t want to get late.&rdquo; So you burn up so much energy worrying about being late by the time you get there, all the red lights are in your favor. (Laughter). So one day I said to myself, &ldquo;enough of this wanting to be late, why can&rsquo;t the other guy be late and I be early? Why should I think that I&rsquo;m going to be late, can he not be late?&rdquo; I reversed the mental attitude, not feeling guilt or wishing him any kind of a bad accident or anything and so for the first time when I saw it work, I laughed, I arrived at my destination all green lights and he&rsquo;s busy apologizing for the red lights. (Laughter). Audience: I understand the timing with regards to outside events but how can we become conscious of the timing of our own selves? Adano: Time is a word that will make a lot of us think it does not exist since it&rsquo;s being conscious of where you are and you have to use your cells by breathing to be self-conscious and therefore you could say to yourself you have all the time in the world because all time is really Now and there is really no yesterday and there is really no tomorrow. Whatever occurred yesterday occurred in the Now of yesterday. Whatever will occur tomorrow will be in the Now of tomorrow when it occurs. So we can go around in circles talking to ourselves from within but eventually you will find that you will verbally zero in on the internal atomic light of the cell and then you would have a true picture of timing in the cellular structure. The distance light crosses the width of an electron is a unit of time in the cell. You are an atom conditioned onto a cellular form, you carry a tremendous power within you, the capacity to monitor called consciousness. Yet the only way you can validate it is to look inward and that&rsquo;s the direction every teacher gives, &ldquo;When the eyes,&rdquo; not one, he said both, &ldquo;are single,&rdquo; now how could you make two eyes single? Try as you like, looking outside it could never be single, it would be distorting all around. The only way it could singularly focus or singularly refer itself to or center itself, you have to close then you have a single vision and then closed vision. &ldquo;When the eyes are single, the whole body,&rdquo; now this is more scientific now, it&rsquo;s getting more scientific, no reference to any object outside the whole body, the whole cellular mechanism, &ldquo;IS,&rdquo; not was, IS &ldquo;full,&rdquo; capacity, &ldquo;of light.&rdquo; Now imagine a cellular mechanism being monitored by its own cell capabilities, the maximum light potential locked up in it and to zero in on specific measurements, each cell, each unit would involve light. And therefore a unit of time, if you&rsquo;re going to say time means an emission of this, that&rsquo;s time spelled backward, &ldquo;e-m-i-t,&rdquo; because this is really an emission mechanism and what is an emission, it&rsquo;s an energy field. As we get more specific, more objective and intrinsic, it has to go across certain dimensions and so to put it in a unit measurement to make it repetitious to be practical to survive, we will eventually recognize that this timing is propelling itself from within the atomic structure and therefore the distance it will travel across the width of the electron would give you your unit of timing inside of you. &ldquo;The light is shining in the darkness,&rdquo; here you become trapped now for the first time because when you look inside you see darkness and yet if you remember when you were initiated you saw a light within you, right? &ldquo;And the light is shining in the darkness but the darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; the very cell that is circular, that contains light, sets of a force field of darkness to compress the light, keeping the light in a state of &ldquo;capsuled down.&rdquo; The more you verbalize, the more the light disappears because you&rsquo;re putting up a shield in front of it. The less you&rsquo;ve verbalize, which is called the internal dialogue, the less you want to match words or your programming from the environment, the more the light seems to expand. &ldquo;Let your light so shine,&rdquo; that means diminish the verbalization in order for the force field of light to fill out and take over and push away the darkness. Before who? &ldquo;Let your light so shine before who?&rdquo; It only says Man, your fellow Man. &ldquo;That they may see the good works and glorify the Father which is in you.&rdquo; Others will feel or sense or actually see by the eyes when it&rsquo;s open this glow of total vision and they will sense a synchronicity with you. 1:00 From that moment on, whatever you put in the brain as a program like a computer, it punches up. Now picture for one moment you&rsquo;re in the place of the mind of Jesus, as Paul says &ldquo;Give me that mind that was in Christ&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re sitting there and somebody says to you &ldquo;Lazarus is dead&rdquo; and if you don&rsquo;t have any comprehension of what you are intrinsically, you may not be able to say &ldquo;Lazarus come forth.&rdquo; Now imagine when you said &ldquo;Lazarus come forth,&rdquo; out of the grave says &ldquo;No boss, I ain&rsquo;t getting up for you.&rdquo; That blows away all your realization about yourself but if the mechanism of Lazarus gets up and comes out and then you the person who is applying the law would suddenly say &ldquo;Father, I didn&rsquo;t have to say it in a loud voice, only because of the people around.&rdquo; Light, sonics, timing, rhythm. Now this phenomenon is not restricted only to the man Jesus because he was the very first man to say &ldquo;The things I do, you will do also and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; That lays the groundwork for greater things for him to experience too but if he says &ldquo;Not greater than me&rdquo; and &ldquo;no further than this,&rdquo; then you know where you are and you know who he is. But the principle doesn&rsquo;t do that in the mechanism, the principle is giving you greater and greater possibilities of yourself which then makes you more conscious of the internal cellular timing to the demand and you can&rsquo;t express it before the demand is there. You couldn&rsquo;t command the force to move if there is no demand. Who would fill a full cup, you see what I mean? So you couldn&rsquo;t express any motion on your part if there is no demand for it, the timing is always evidence of the demand and your ability to synchronize to fit the demand. So again no-thing moves except by Divine Will, there is no object moving in proper synchronicity if it wants to perform efficiently. If it doesn&rsquo;t want to perform efficiently it would be out of what? Synchronicity. Everything to perform efficiently must be in its state of synchronicity, this is Divine Will, nothing moves except by Divine Will. It&rsquo;s another way of saying no physical function or cosmic function or intrinsic function is occurring without synchronicity. So don&rsquo;t feel that timing, though reduced to represent Divine Will, is a mundane thing, it&rsquo;s not a mundane thing, it&rsquo;s a very sacred thing so sacred that you don&rsquo;t violate or try to push it. You know what they say &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t break a law of nature, you break yourself against it&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s how we learn the hard way. It that clear enough? Audience: So guessing that timing that is proper is more or less anticipating the events that are going to happen? Adano: I&rsquo;ll have to quote Sri Yukteswar, &ldquo;God is un-anticipatory, ever-new joy&rdquo; and though we may foretell our future conditions, it doesn&rsquo;t compel us to experience it. Therefore the stars may foretell but they don&rsquo;t compel and by this we learn now the deeper impact of timing on our lives, we have a freedom in timing. We don&rsquo;t exercise it because we don&rsquo;t know how to exercise it and the only time we can exercise this freedom is in a necessity. That&rsquo;s why the scriptural writings that the Eastern teachers would say &ldquo;All your needs are fulfilled,&rdquo; they didn&rsquo;t say all your wants are fulfilled. So life as a functional process is a necessity motivated synchronous organism comprising your cellular structure as the ultimate form of experience, do you get it now? That&rsquo;s why God cannot be competed with, He&rsquo;s unique in the sense that he became you but He will permit you and I and everyone in this room to have more and more of the potential to bring to the surface, we&rsquo;ll never run out of our potential. Audience: Then why is it that everybody isn&rsquo;t just absolutely frantic to find out how to do this? Adano: (Laughter). Some of us are like chicken eggs, some of us are like turtle eggs, some of us are like dinosaur eggs. Chicken eggs take 21 days to hatch, turtle eggs may take 90 days to hatch, and dinosaur eggs take 1000 years to hatch. (Laughter). It&rsquo;s the degree of toxicity to which each one of us are being exposed to that delays the synchronicity or recognition of it. So cleanliness is next to Godliness was a statement made, I just twisted a little to say &ldquo;Cleanliness IS Godliness,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not next to, it is. Because the more you clean up your mechanism, the more you synchronize with the Creative Principle and the obvious experience is no longer miraculous, it&rsquo;s the end result of everything falling into place for the first time which you should have done in the first place before you ever got toxic, you see? And we were non-toxic when we came into existence but we went off and then we lost our synchronicity so we come back to this by opportunity to repeat it. Nature provides the laws for its creation to go through. Audience: How long does it take? Are you suggesting a diet to cleanse? Adano: That&rsquo;s only one of the means of detoxifying the body, that&rsquo;s only one of the means. Even if you follow diet, remember you have to think first to eat incorrectly let alone to think to eat correctly. So again attitude comes back in terms of the action and cleaning up again you&rsquo;re not only going to clean up the physical action, you&rsquo;re going to clean up the thinking process too then you&rsquo;re going to try and look at the objective results. So it&rsquo;s not just something you&rsquo;re going to allow yourself to be subjected to and can&rsquo;t do anything, you have a way now to change the mental attitude, change the input or the output, and gradually bring it back into alignment. 1:10 The same way like a car, if we put so much trust in a vehicle to take us down the road with our lives at stake, like I flew in a plane today and I&rsquo;m looking at the metal there and I&rsquo;m thinking of the many brains that went to put this whole piece of machinery together and the whole conversation was chronicity or timing for each of these gadget to stay stable for the thing to fly but that isn&rsquo;t obvious until you relate. What is so obvious is the rotating of the fan and the seats all these things are obvious, the most important thing that should be obvious you don&rsquo;t see it but if one of those pieces of equipment be off time, what do we got? A nosedive, you see. So this if in a physical way is obvious to us then attitudinally, program-wise to the way we speak to ourselves is far more important to the realization of ourselves. All great teachers will tell you the same thing in their own way but when you break it down into a practical application and that&rsquo;s what you want now. We don&rsquo;t want to remain like children in kindergarten and not apply the law of life in practical ways otherwise we&rsquo;d be hurting ourselves and condemning one another and becoming very fanatical and in the end we&rsquo;ve missed the boat. It&rsquo;s when we start working with it and getting to the practical level of it, we start to see the commonality then we can go on without feeling guilty or threatened by the environment. The environment is here before us to offer us the opportunity to synchronize for the highest good but we can interfere or block that synchronicity by the attitude. That&rsquo;s how come one great man wrote this book called &ldquo;Positive Thinking&rdquo; but the thinking is the attitude necessary for the action and you have to think that you act and if you think and have to act then what is the basis of it? It&rsquo;s the rhythm or the synchronicity. Now you&rsquo;re a musician? Good. If you have four people playing with you and everyone plays in their own way, are you gonna have any music coming out? See what I mean? The same thing applies, we use the word spirituality, it&rsquo;s just another way of saying the spiraling force field of the cells and how to synchronize with that which is your DNA and RNA. They&rsquo;re set up like a helix inside of you so more and more our research world and its results are making us conscious minus guilt as the reality of our true spiritual nature. Not churchianistic or overly religious, no, those terms can put you in the wrong frame of experience. The spiritual person, I don&rsquo;t know if you all saw the picture of Gandhi, you know what he said? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hindu, I&rsquo;m a Jew, I&rsquo;m a Christian, above all I&rsquo;m a human being.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s more important, the emphasis on being. He didn&rsquo;t aspire to have any great qualities, he just wanted to live what is factually now and work with the timing of the period and spirituality is that. It&rsquo;s showing up all around us in many ways through the movies, through the different art forms that we didn&rsquo;t recognize before, now we are starting to relate and recognize it. It is becoming more and more obvious that all of us are good, don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. Remember one thing, you&rsquo;re born a winner, it could be worse. (Laughter). Audience: Now we&rsquo;re all going around detoxifying and trying to get synchronized and I&rsquo;ve read certain people or their vibrational patterns you come in contact with them, you&rsquo;ll pick up their patterns and so some Masters would say don&rsquo;t shake hands with anybody, don&rsquo;t touch anybody because you&rsquo;ll pick up their vibrations. I don&rsquo;t understand, what should we do? Adano: Yes, no, maybe. You see when you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, don&rsquo;t touch. It&rsquo;s like a child, he don&rsquo;t know a hot cup will burn their hands so you tell them don&rsquo;t touch but they&rsquo;ll push to find out and then scald themselves. And when you know what you&rsquo;re doing, you pick up a rag and take the cup off the stove and you don&rsquo;t burn your hands and maybe if you&rsquo;re pouring a hot stuff into the cup that is cold then you don&rsquo;t burn your hands either. It&rsquo;s a matter of knowing. It would be highly impractical to say don&rsquo;t touch anyone. If a person is dying there and another person comes along and says &ldquo;Oh boy, you&rsquo;re not Jewish like me or you&rsquo;re not Chinese like me, I can&rsquo;t touch you. You&rsquo;re not rich like me, I can&rsquo;t touch you.&rdquo; And another person walks in the room and says &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;d better call an ambulance and do something&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the story of the good Samaritan. It&rsquo;s to make you realize that we can carry the idea out of scope in terms of what is practical and human and what is more important is not that the person may be bad or they may not be the same peer group or rich like you, is that it&rsquo;s a human being and don&rsquo;t judge them from karma and don&rsquo;t judge them from heredity. Always look at them at the higher potential of God in them because that may be God&rsquo;s way to test you if you believe in a higher potential in your own self and the more humanistic you can generate contact, the more compassionate this force field will shoot up like a champagne out of you. But it needs that kind of a confrontation to trigger that&hellip; (gap in tape). Would you say the man who has to handle a deceased corpse is going to worry? Put on a pair of gloves and pack it away and when you look at your loved one that has passed away, when he was up and walking around you hug him. When he&rsquo;s lying there in a coffin, flat on his back for a long time and you&rsquo;re not going to (inaudible). It&rsquo;s comical you know, you can get locked into a lot of things, the most important thing is the heart. You see in my work I have to work with all kinds of sick people and I heard that before I ever got into therapy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch this person, don&rsquo;t touch that person&rdquo; and when you get into therapy, you don&rsquo;t have time to think that because the person may be going from good to worse as far as their health is concerned and you know it doesn&rsquo;t take long for them to stop breathing. If you can&rsquo;t help them to hold on to that breath and get some sense of focus simply because you don&rsquo;t want to touch them, it&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s very frustrating that you find yourself in a helpless state like that when you feel that you couldn&rsquo;t reach out and touch, even to just console the person in some way. A gesture or kindness could be all they needed to pull them out of it and that&rsquo;s why they say the good Samaritan story is a very good way to solve the feeling of touch or don&rsquo;t touch. 1:20 Why I point out that is there&rsquo;s a a story that goes like this, it has to do with devotion and touching is a devotional concept. There was a man who traveled from the States to India after World War 2 was over and he read a book on the Eastern teachings and he wanted to go and meet some living person who could tell him about these spiritual laws that are written about. And he respected the author because author happened to be a neighborhood friend of his in the same town he was born in, went to the same school but they never saw each other in India and so the author mentions these people in the East. So this man goes all the way to the East and travels from place to place and finally he arrives at a place they call an ashram or community and he meets a living teacher there, someone who&rsquo;s living there and talking about spiritual subjects. There was no difference about him, he was just ordinary dressed and he stayed there for a while and got initiated into the art of meditation then he left and came back to America. When he got home, this is what he told his wife, he said &ldquo;Honey I&rsquo;m a different man now. I no longer eat the meat and I no longer drink alcohol and I need time off to be silent in myself and I don&rsquo;t smoke no more.&rdquo; She looked at them and she said &ldquo;Honey don&rsquo;t make me into you, I like my nip, I like my little meat, I like my little cigarette. I&rsquo;ll cook your food in a clean pot, plate, and everything, everything will be meticulous, and nothing will have anything to do with mine&rdquo; and that was the agreement &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me into you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;daisy don&rsquo;t convert me into a rose.&rdquo; All right, this went on for many years and they lived happily together and one day the teacher came for a visit to this country and he invites the teacher to their home and he told the teacher what a great wife he has, that she would cook food for him without any meat or anything. The teacher said all right and they went to the house and it was lunchtime and they got to the table and there was the wife, cooked the food and their food was separate food and the teacher looked at her straight like that and as he sat down he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll initiate you.&rdquo; Now that blew this man&rsquo;s whole entire mind, here he for years been&hellip; and when he went to India he had to clean up his act and clean up his body before he could get initiated, be a vegetarian to some extent, and here she&rsquo;s been eating and nipping, puffing, and she&rsquo;s gonna be initiated right away. Well he did like that and he said the teacher waved his hand in front of her face and (inaudible), she had a double shot of champagne and she&rsquo;s gone flying and she&rsquo;s seeing all kind of colors and feeling wonderful experiences of joy. That evening the teacher is ready to retire and so his friend said &ldquo;Sir, can I ask you one question before you retire?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;How come you initiated her just like that right away, never seeing her, and me all the time in India back and forth over the years?&rdquo; Then the teacher said to him, these are the words he said, &ldquo;Your devotion is a devotion of the brain. Her devotion is a devotion of the heart.&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t say a devotion to what, it left the man to figure out what the teacher meant. &ldquo;Your devotion is a devotion of the brain. Her devotion is a devotion of the heart&rdquo; and then he tells me later on what the teacher meant, &ldquo;A devotion of the brain is I&rsquo;m too busy worrying what I should and what I should not do to please my teacher in order to live a spiritual life. Whereas my wife simply cooked the food and you&rsquo;re my husband and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo; (Inaudible), she&rsquo;s not going to offend her husband, he wants to eat no meat and don&rsquo;t drink no alcohol and no smoke so she just did it and that was doing it from her heart as a wife. She wasn&rsquo;t arguing questions why she should or should not, her devotion was simply doing the thing as she was asked. And he said then he realized now why when the teacher arrived and saw the two of them, who was really having the internal growth. So don&rsquo;t make your devotion one of the brain, to touch or not to touch, make it from the heart. That&rsquo;s where you come back again, &ldquo;The pure in heart sees God&rdquo; not the pure in brain sees God. (Laughter). You see the ancient people were very specific in their anatomy and their feelings in the anatomy because your brain will constantly analyze left and right side, what and why. The heart doesn&rsquo;t have that to do, it just does but it has a compensation, the brain has a compensation too in the analysis, it&rsquo;s not easily fooled. Therefore when the heart takes over after it&rsquo;s been convinced there&rsquo;s no shenanigans going on in the brain then the heart takes over. Whereas the other way the heart can be fooled but even so the heart will override its being self-fooled. That&rsquo;s a wonderful part of the heart, it can override its own self fooling, the brain cannot do that, it needs the heart to do that because once you&rsquo;re being fooled with your brain, you don&rsquo;t trust it no more, it takes a long time to generate the compassion but if you&rsquo;re fooled from the heart, you still will push again to ride above it and come out. The heart is designed to do that, to rise above a self betrayal more than the brain. It&rsquo;s the reservoir of the compassion. Audience: Can you say a few words about attitude since that story seems to be in some way also about attitude but what attitude should we try to develop or which ones do we have to be afraid or be careful of? Adano: Over monitoring yourself too much, that&rsquo;s the attitude you have to avoid, making it too much of a brain issue of doing things that are functional and rational to be practical about your spiritual nature. Your spiritual nature isn&rsquo;t something that you&rsquo;re trying to put on a shelf as a polished object, spiritual nature is a process of living moment to moment as practical as possible. Therefore you don&rsquo;t sum up or assess a true spiritual person by their miraculous abilities or their possessions or their logistical communication, you judge them from their ability to be practical in any situation, that&rsquo;s how you judge it. Their sense of practicality under every circumstance or situation that comes up and how simple and practical they can be at the same time, that&rsquo;s the real attitude you should be focused on, to keep it as simple and practical. The reason is that every law in nature after you start analyzing it and working with it, you see how simple it is, you just couldn&rsquo;t realize how you missed it and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking at and you&rsquo;re trying to maintain that. As one teacher told his student &ldquo;I rather you read a hundred books, investigate all there is, talk with all the people in the world before you attempt to sit down for 10 minutes to meditate&rdquo; because what you would do in the 10 minutes is so simple, you&rsquo;re not going to believe that&rsquo;s what you have to do. So he says &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you take all your time, go all the truth, and then when you&rsquo;re satisfied that it&rsquo;s a non-verbal experience, then you&rsquo;ll sit down and watch inside.&rdquo; 1:30 That&rsquo;s how come they use the term Jehovah Witness consciousness is witnessing life in motion in the organism and doesn&rsquo;t interfere or try to monitor it or try to direct it, it merely learns to recognize its rhythms and in the recognition of its rhythms, it will begin to experience the timing or what you say Divine Will, it will get up to move with it. That is exactly why they say the dance of life because once you sit down and you watch internally, you hear the internal music and music is the food&hellip; sonics, cellular sonics, feeds consciousness which is the food of the Soul. Consciousness must talk, that&rsquo;s language, it must resonate in order to be respected and it&rsquo;s a hard thing to admit that your big fat mouth is important among people. To remain silent is not so often looked upon as&hellip; and yet it&rsquo;s powerful enough to make people respect you when you don&rsquo;t talk but this sonics goes on in you and your consciousness is watching this internal rhythm, this constriction, this dilation that&rsquo;s occurring in you from breathing as you watch it. Then eventually there is no more right brain/left brain arguments, it&rsquo;s a witnessing and it&rsquo;s a synchronicity but it doesn&rsquo;t remain there. That&rsquo;s just like the grape being picked and squashed, it has to move on to the next level of wine fermenting and then fermenting to a higher quality like champagne. So sitting there and looking is not the end of it, you may suddenly get glimpses and you think you&rsquo;re psychic. Well you&rsquo;re entitled to that because that&rsquo;s the next level up but don&rsquo;t be trapped in it because Paul will tell you those are only the gifts of the Spirit, that&rsquo;s not the actual fruit of the Spirit yet. That can leave you, a blow on the head and you lose all your psychic capability but you&rsquo;re still going to be a humble person with a blow on your head or be egotistical about being hit on the head. So keep on watching inside and then the watching begins to recognize outward synchronicity which is timing which is learning to fit, everything falls into place. You move into the final stage and that&rsquo;s what they call the wisdom or understanding is the fruit of the Spirit. You understand now that this mechanism is unique and designed to exonerate you from all your guilt and express total compassion by timing which is God-realization. Any other question? Audience: Why is sitting in a fairly static position so important, sitting meditation? Adano: Well if you disengage from the beta level of your brain by looking inside when you&rsquo;re standing up, you&rsquo;re liable to fall over and hit your head and if you&rsquo;re lying flat on your back and you disengage somebody may walk in and think you&rsquo;re dead but if you&rsquo;re sitting there, they may say &ldquo;Oh, he might be snoozing or he may be practicing his weird techniques&rdquo; so they don&rsquo;t touch you, they don&rsquo;t bother you. So the Eastern man realized many people were carted away my mistake for lying on their back practicing meditation and those that fell over hit their head, you know you could be unconscious when you hit the ground. It&rsquo;s a very tricky state of the brain to withdraw from the beta level of active eye movement to a slow down rate of the alpha to watch without distraction which is the first level of verbally behavior. So sitting or kneeling this way you know for sure you&rsquo;re not going nowhere because you can&rsquo;t go that way, you see what I mean? (Laughter). At least they know you&rsquo;re praying but it&rsquo;s the fact that the person can be assumed to be in a state of death if they&rsquo;re flat on their back and they&rsquo;re not breathing because when you get into lower states of the brain, the respiratory rate diminishes to a level that the eyes can&rsquo;t recognize it and you need equipment to vouch. Well Yogananda had a teacher who one night was lying flat on his back and he walked in the room and he said &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; his teacher must be dead so he goes to get a mirror and put it under his nose to see if he&rsquo;s breathing and he don&rsquo;t get no reading and by that time, he&rsquo;s ready to call the undertaker. So the teacher opened his eyes and says &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to sleep? Stop worrying, get rid of your mosquito consciousness.&rdquo; You see mosquitoes were sitting on the teacher&rsquo;s body and not stinging the teacher but he was busy hitting at the mosquitoes and he wanted to wake up the teacher but the teacher was already in that deep state. So it can be very very tricky in the initial state so that&rsquo;s the reason why the precaution was the sit down or possibly kneel. Western man who got it from Jesus who knelt in the Garden of Gethsemane and did most of his meditation in the kneeling posture. Eastern man sat down but yet kneeling or prostrating also was found in the East, you find that in Tibet, they prostrate because it&rsquo;s one of the first respect to the Creator as the Earth. &ldquo;Who are thou o&rsquo; man to stand before the Creative Principle when the earth thou standest on is holy?&rdquo; So if the Earth you stand on is holy, you question yourself &ldquo;how can it be holy?&rdquo; It contains all the minerals that your body contains, it just happens to be at a different speed, yours is a tissue and that is the actual mineral you&rsquo;re looking at. The sense of respect for the connective unity would make you bow down but if you want to make it a little more realistic, you can look at it this way. &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness, God created He them and breathed into Man breath of life and Man became a living soil.&rdquo; (Laughter). Come let us make a manifestation with a dualistic polarity of plus and minus and infuse it with vitacity or energization and all forms became vital soil. 1:40 You&rsquo;re not saying any different from the principle, you&rsquo;re enhancing the principle without guilt. We are living soil but we can soil ourselves by being what? Tearing it down so meditation is a way to get back to all these inner understandings of yourself to free you from the fears and sitting is good, kneeling was original in the first place to make you appreciate the soil is sacred and you are soil, you are 144 elements: 12 basic and the rest are all trace minerals, you can&rsquo;t do without them. So like it or not we are forced to respect it and yet within the same apparent soil that can be dirty to the eye with the inherent vitacity, it becomes flesh and yet within the same form of flesh it has a quality not yet released, the non-decomposing quality of it. Every other form of life that comes from the soil decomposes or are soiled by their behavior and yet there is one form of life that continues to go on, that comes from the soil, and that is a caterpillar. He eats this way from the products around that feeds off the soil and then it spins the cocoon, shuts itself down like a meditation, and emerges like a butterfly, a new entire species that flies for the first time, no longer limited to the crawling on the soil, totally elevated off of it. Yet there is nothing more beautiful that flies to compare the butterfly. Look at all the things that fly and looks like one little butterfly, it&rsquo;s fantastic. Yet at the same time as much as it flies, you will never find a rotten butterfly but you&rsquo;ll find a rotten caterpillar or a rotten bird and you find rotten people too. It&rsquo;s the real one that don&rsquo;t rot is a glory to the God that is locked up in it in the apparent soil that didn&rsquo;t soil itself, it cleaned up its act, do you get the picture now? So sitting down is good, kneeling down came first, lying down is not too ideal and standing up is not too ideal because there can be problems in situations like that. Yet at the same time, you have to graduate to the posture that Man was designed for, the only posture and that is this, standing on his two feet, walking with the God in him. He&rsquo;s gotta graduate from sitting down, he has to graduate from groveling in the dirt, lying on his back to this posture: wide eyed open, carrying his Goddess in him. Not closing his eyes and walking around but he has to graduate there because that&rsquo;s the measurement of his God-ness, the measurement of his spirituality in the Now synchronizing with the demand on his mechanism. One can say Superman is no longer fictitious, the qualities are all there too but we are moving into that direction like it or not, it&rsquo;s locked up in yourself. Yes, you had a question there. Audience: I just wanted to say thank you for this opportunity of allowing us to share this experience and (inaudible). One question in meditation, when that door opens what is the focus of concentration (inaudible)? Adano: You&rsquo;ve got what they call &ldquo;signal,&rdquo; the five words that were given to you at initiation, that&rsquo;s like the SOS. Drowning in the world of words, you&rsquo;re sending out the signal that will pull you out so that that intelligence that pulls sonics together and commands light will suction you out of the verbal dialogue into the non-verbal level. So you have to use your call signals and you know you wouldn&rsquo;t dial a phone and ask for Adano and hang up before I answer, right? You wait until I say &ldquo;hello.&rdquo; And you say, &ldquo;Is that Adano?&rdquo; And I say &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; and then you start your conversation. That&rsquo;s the same way with that call signal inside, it&rsquo;s a call signal to the five levels of creation: the sonics, the gaseous, the temperature, the liquid, and the crystalline because you have to pass through these five to get beyond the sonic range into the non-sonic range which is what we say the non-verbal levels but you need that call signal to get you through. In other words it&rsquo;s like your Visa card or Mastercharge to get credit from that direction. If you somebody vouches for you at the store for your credit, those sounds freeze their brain from reliance on the verbal levels and then it suctions you, it opens the door from inside. There&rsquo;s no door that is opened from the outside. You see, &ldquo;Door of my heart, open wide I keep for you,&rdquo; it has to be from the inside then we enter it but we&rsquo;re allow to come back out because we are vouched for already so our return is already guaranteed. It&rsquo;s like my plane ticket is already paid for to go back, you see what I mean? You go in, you have a call signal to go into the non-verbal level and then you have a right to come back to the verbal level and function. So when you look into the door of consciousness to the light, you have the signals to send in that you go through. Because what is going through is a label, something someone called you. What did they call you when you&rsquo;re born, when they christened you? They didn&rsquo;t call you &ldquo;yeeaaaahhh.&rdquo; (Laughter). Isn&rsquo;t that the first sound you made? I heard a joke you know they say in China when you&rsquo;re born and they want to give you names, they take all the pots and pans in the kitchen, tie it with a string, throw it up in the air and it falls down, &ldquo;cam a lang a long,&rdquo; and that your name (laughter). So my friend War Eagle would say you&rsquo;ve got to wait until you&rsquo;re 30 years of age to go prove yourself and get a name. So all these things come up to a labeling after the fact so if we keep relating to that, it&rsquo;s not valid enough for the internal awareness of ourself. We only have one name and it never changes, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;me.&rdquo; You never lost that name and it never changes, &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s the true you and &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; I and the me are one and the same because you have to use the verbal sonics to emphasize the &ldquo;I&rdquo; to synchronize with the reservoir of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; where the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is projected out as a communication sonics. &ldquo;Me&rdquo; gives &ldquo;I&rdquo; opportunity to resonate from the open mouth and it can only be respected by the &ldquo;you&rdquo; that is &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the other person talking back to you. It&rsquo;s a comedy but these are the three words: the &ldquo;I, you, me&rdquo; game. 1:50 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on first, who&rsquo;s the second, and I don&rsquo;t know is on third,&rdquo; you know that story? That&rsquo;s the same kind of thing you have in conscious being but we are living it but we have to understand it and work with it. That takes away all the guilt and all the condemnations that you may generate from programming or incorrect programming. (Gap in tape). As you work more with the process of signaling to the door of consciousness to the light and you clean up the mechanism by the respiratory technique and free it from the feedback, you&rsquo;ll find the mechanism becomes more and more aligned with the timing. But at the same time there are moments when we feel challenged or confronted, when logic generates frustration and indecision, and that&rsquo;s where we can either be vulnerable to the ego craving to be out of time and be vulnerable because it may act out the time. But if it doesn&rsquo;t do that and it stays within its own time as it is set up to do then it will not put you in a vulnerable position. I&rsquo;ll give you an example, &ldquo;Father remove this cup,&rdquo; a statement made by Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane while meditating and foreseeing the crucifixion on the cross and the painful end of his life in the human frame. His ego could get the best part of him if he goes out of synchronicity, seeing it all within already, but then he realizes that could not be valid though it would be an escape or delay of the time, what is valid that the time is coming due that he may have to face the greatest test and if the test is set already, there are already compensations for every test. The Creative Intelligence does not test Itself without compensating Itself, It&rsquo;s not one of those kinds of a function. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a science and an art at the same time, it&rsquo;s a rewarding principle. &ldquo;Not my will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay, I know this is coming up, all I need now is the strength to go through it, stick it out to the end.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s going to be rough, I&rsquo;m not going to say it&rsquo;s easy, and that&rsquo;s how you don&rsquo;t allow the ego now to throw you off the timing and you will synchronize to the end each function, though it may be painful, yet it&rsquo;s not destructive enough to revert into the egoistic level, you see what I mean? And that&rsquo;s what they say &ldquo;It could be worse.&rdquo; Every step of the way always see what you got and say &ldquo;it could be worse.&rdquo; So even death may seem like death and it could be worse yet again when you triumph over the death, there you know you didn&rsquo;t revert to the egoistic level, you still kept the consciousness and that that synchronicity pulled you through. Basically that&rsquo;s the highest test we&rsquo;ll ever have in the form, the cocoon state of the caterpillar, the death state of the mechanism to shirk from the egoistic desire to avoid or work with it so that the ego don&rsquo;t take over and change the rhythm. (Gap in tape). Audience: How do you know when you&rsquo;re supposed to face the dragon and when you sidestep the dragon? Adano: Now that&rsquo;s a good question. Well the person who is not ready will know from within themselves that they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to face the dragon because they have never faced anything before and worked their way through it. You can&rsquo;t give up what you never experienced and you cannot encounter and work through conditions that you have never had any opportunity to rise above. You must have had or will have to have conditions thrown in your path to help you to arise or raise yourself above them. So until you&rsquo;re ready to face the dragon, you&rsquo;re going to be given little lizards to jump around, see what I mean? You&rsquo;re going to have precautionary or preparatory exposures to develop the quality of facing it. So sidestepping really wouldn&rsquo;t be any sidestepping, that would be the time spent in preparing to face the dragon. So when you look back on the many things that you overcame in your life and it didn&rsquo;t destroy you, your persistence to continue is what gives you the strength now to face to dragon. But the dragon is only proportionate to the degree of the immunity because every time it tests you, it is only trying to extract a higher level of your immunity for you. It is trying to get you stronger within yourself, it&rsquo;s trying to allow the greater qualities of your potential that you&rsquo;re unaware of to come to the surface. It isn&rsquo;t intending to destroy you, that&rsquo;s not its intent, its intent is to bring out the best in you at every level. It&rsquo;s just when you may not realize that and the ego gets the best part, then you may lose your synchronicity but otherwise you will find that if you go with it, as they say &ldquo;go with the flow&rdquo; instead of bucking it, you will adapt to the challenge and you&rsquo;ll go through. Like some people who want to take their basic training, when they&rsquo;re told to crawl through the barbed wire, they forgot to listen to the sergeant and kept their buttocks up too high. (Laughter). See that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about so you have to listen to the instructions too and go through the barbed wire. You&rsquo;ll get that sense of knowing from previous experiences of overcoming obstacles and that will give you your cue or clue to how to cope with every condition. In the first place you can&rsquo;t have a challenge if it&rsquo;s not in your karmic confrontations, I&rsquo;ll give an example. There was a young couple who met a teacher and they said to the teacher we got married many years ago and we would like to have children but we don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get any. We&rsquo;ve tried for a long time, no results, could you as our teacher bless us with the opportunity of having children? 2:00 The teacher listened, he looked all over the room, they wondered what the hell is was doing. Then he says &ldquo;I think your karma is over, I don&rsquo;t see any Soul waiting to come in to work out karma with you.&rdquo; That kind of freaked them out for a while, he doesn&rsquo;t see any Soul waiting to come out and work karma with them and so he says &ldquo;Maybe your karma is over with having children, maybe a healthy relationship with two people working and serving and being part of the community, may be your role&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re young people. &ldquo;Oh teacher, we&rsquo;re so young, that don&rsquo;t make us feel good, there must be something we can do.&rdquo; After awhile he looked around. &ldquo;If you are persistent, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll evolve a tree into the level of a human being for you but don&rsquo;t expect it to be more than a woodhead when it&rsquo;s born.&rdquo; Since there&rsquo;s none there waiting to work out karma in your mechanism and we all evolved from the tree already and the resins leached off the tree and then down into the water and mingled with sodium chloride in salt water, amoeba was formed, you see? So he would speed up this process so fast that the sperm may take form and the ovum and they&rsquo;ll be having a healthy child that is born, looks pleasing but don&rsquo;t expect it to be more than a wood-head because there&rsquo;s no karma. It didn&rsquo;t generate any karma to have to pay, it don&rsquo;t have any memory banks other than what? Being a tree see? So that&rsquo;s one of the problems of asking a teacher for something you may not need, they didn&rsquo;t have any confrontations to go through. So we don&rsquo;t really get conditions to face unless we&rsquo;ve got it already assigned to us or we have merited it. Now the same is true of the blind man that was healed by the man Jesus and they asked &ldquo;Who sin that the man is born blind?&rdquo; Did the the man sin to be born blind? If he did then that&rsquo;s past life, that&rsquo;s why he has the karma. If his parents sinned that he be born blind, that&rsquo;s heredity. &ldquo;I visit the sins of the the parents on the third and fourth generation.&rdquo; But then the man Jesus says &ldquo;Neither.&rdquo; Well if that&rsquo;s neither, what do we got? He&rsquo;s looking around and says &ldquo;Oh no, not from the past life, not from your parents,&rdquo; what have we got here? &ldquo;To the greater glory of God,&rdquo; that means the Soul of this man and I (Jesus), the present being, in this present body, came to demonstrate greater potential within your own nature to rise above your limitations. Don&rsquo;t shut yourself out, don&rsquo;t limit yourself, and sight is looking at things that you don&rsquo;t want to look at or refusing to look at or (gap in tape)&hellip; confrontation but greater strength in that man but (inaudible), he was healed of his blindness. So, but at the same time when he healed the man he did a peculiar act, it wasn&rsquo;t recognized to mean anything but the person who recorded it made a great issue of recording it. In order to heal the man when he was confronted by the people who wanted to know why the man was born blind or if the man inherited his blindness from his parents and he said &ldquo;neither,&rdquo; the way he healed this man was very very significant of telling these people they don&rsquo;t know what the heck they were talking about. I mean the way he healed him was like this, (Adano makes a spitting sound), he spit on the ground as a rebuking way to say to the public &ldquo;You are so limited in your thinking, you are so narrow-minded, you don&rsquo;t seem to want to go beyond the mere saliva of somebody who has a cough and spit it out. You&rsquo;re too busy projecting your oddities or toxicity.&rdquo; So he spits on the ground and picks it up and rolls it in a ball and then puts it on the blind man&rsquo;s (inaudible) to heal him. It&rsquo;s his way of rebuking them in their limitations just as much as they say &ldquo;Father I didn&rsquo;t have to say it in a loud voice, only because of the people.&rdquo; Many times he made gestures or comments to indicate we are selling ourselves short in terms of our problems and our confrontations and that we have to dig into ourselves to tap the deeper potentials. So when the dragon comes up, think back how many times you&rsquo;ve battled the lizards and then you know if you&rsquo;re ready for the dragon. Audience: Thank you. Adano: And there&rsquo;s another statement that will validate that, &ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t give you more than you can bear,&rdquo; right? Is that what he said? So it means you can&rsquo;t have a greater confrontation than you&rsquo;re competent or capable or have already developed immunity to or carry the potential capable of handling it. You&rsquo;ve got it in you, you&rsquo;ve got the quality, you pull it to the surface. Audience: And yet a good many people crack under stress or pain which seems to contradict that statement that sometimes the pain is too great. Adano: Yes no maybe. Yes they may crack under the pain and the stress because their ego is still out of synchronicity due to their toxicity, they haven&rsquo;t gained sufficient insight to learning to synchronize with life. They&rsquo;re maybe still pushing or wanting their own way and it has to be changed to suit them and they may be saying &ldquo;why me and why not somebody else, why should I suffer this.&rdquo; These are all maybe subliminally going on in their mind and then they may crack because they didn&rsquo;t make enough internal preparation to work with the laws of testing us. Audience: If we accept, everything is relatively easy. Adano: Yes that&rsquo;s why a friend of mine wrote the book years ago who lived in Canada, he was a sick man who injured his body. He was a doctor and he tried every means to heal himself even with all his colleagues and finally he came back to one statement &ldquo;I have to let go of all my intellectual training, all my colleagues good wishes and their methods of healing me and get down to the basics like a baby.&rdquo; And the book he wrote is called &ldquo;Let Go, Let God,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a very small little book but he was healed of his illness and he went around performing tremendous work getting people to come back to their basic humility of letting go, let God. So we do have to go with it and not fight it and the more we can let go and go with it, we find that we do ride the storm. Well all right there are case histories where the mere fact that the man kept laughing at the fact that he had cancer, he was cured, right? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous that I should suffer like this!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not preposterous &ldquo;why me Lord?&rdquo; Do you see the difference in the preposterousness of the attitude? One would say &ldquo;Why me&rdquo; and then cry for having it and the other one &ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous a thing like this happening to me! That&rsquo;s great, me of all people, I&rsquo;m glad to have the opportunity!&rdquo; And that kind of attitude is a correction than the other attitude of what? Feeling he is being put upon. In other words this man was happy to accept that he was being used. 2:10 So again, it&rsquo;s where you are inside. Audience: That&rsquo;s the quality that many of the Saints of all the different religions have had, it&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s how they got through it. Adano: That&rsquo;s exactly it. Have you ever read about Bernadette of Lourdes? The disease she had and when the sister superior who was over her found out what kind of disease she had, it really blew her mind, of trying to put her to work doing all the menial tasks and feeling that she was not trying to cooperate and when the doctor was called in when she fainted and examined her, they were told what type of disease she had? That sister became her sole friend, lifted her and moved her around. The pain that she was enduring was cancer of the bone and never complained and when the sister realized all of that that she had done to her, it made her open her heart more to her. But with all that Bernadette was above the pain in reference of helping others to rise above their pain, that was her tiger or her dragon, you see what I mean? Going through it and working with it, building up her own immunity and when she left the frame, there was no trace of cancer in the bone, that&rsquo;s the compensation. Creative Intelligence has to use us in many ways to show the deeper potential of the principal locked up in us, the butterfly locked up in the caterpillar, the Divinity locked up in the flesh. Audience: Her body is incorrupt too. Adano: Yes but the pain is the requisite of generating immunity, the cells have this locked into them, they can&rsquo;t develop immunity, they can&rsquo;t rise to a higher level of healthiness or their true nature unless they are challenged. Now here&rsquo;s a good example, if you&rsquo;re a manufacturer or product or an inventor of a product, how would you know the product is good until you do what to it? Put it through stress, test it right? Then if it holds up, then you have a working evaluation and that&rsquo;s exactly what Creative Intelligence has done by conditioning Himself into the form of flesh. He has to test Himself within this flesh form, His own divinity and potential if He has accomplished what He intended. You and I don&rsquo;t exist, we are only like little flames in a gas jet. If you look how gas jet is designed, there&rsquo;s only one flame that is really there, that&rsquo;s the pilot light, all the rest is just gas going through holes and yet we all think we&rsquo;re little individual lights all to ourselves. &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m in the world, I&rsquo;m the light of the world,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the pilot light, the rest of us is a bunch of hot air, that&rsquo;s the big fat ego. You see, that&rsquo;s the ego in us, the little one light flickering all over the place but essentially we&rsquo;re the unified gas where we draw from the one pilot light or true Me that is in all of us, that&rsquo;s your pilot light. &ldquo;Thou shall have no other God&rdquo; or not other light within the light that is in you, embody it, work with it. The Eastern countries, you see before Christianity came westward, the science of the Soul was an established science which is spirituality and all the terminology are found in the sayings of Jesus and down through Buddha, Krishna, right on to Jesus and the lost years of Jesus was spent in the Eastern countries. There&rsquo;s even evidence now in the scrolls that they have found and his actual name was Issad and it&rsquo;s recorded that he did go to these places and studied and then finally returned back home and his mission of conveying the knowledge that these men kept to themselves in that part of the world is like everything else, after a certain level of growth, isolationism or seclusionism or rigidity starts setting in and then the layman who cannot afford is often left out in the search for truth and only those who can afford to sustain the religious teachers are the ones that have access to the truth. Therefore periodically men who realize themselves would break away from that conformity and go back to the layman and try to arouse him to his true potential and that&rsquo;s how come through the East we find that Jesus ended up preaching not to the rich or to the intellectual, it was mostly to the layman. They call them sinners and publicans so they&rsquo;re the ones that needed the awakening to their inner potential because they were already becoming traumatized and depressed with their position and the intellectual groups had already made it so rigid in context, it really lost its true importance. So over the years you&rsquo;ll find that each one of us comes into his own awakening and the advent of the mechanical equipment that allows us to see into the structure of matter is the actual quantum leap for Man to live his churchianity and move on to his true Divinity by spirituality. But churchianity is necessary like kindergarden for us as we grow up but we all can&rsquo;t live and remaining in kindergarten, we got to go on to high school or college or university, we got to keep on going. So the awakening process is becoming more and more obvious and the practicality is making itself felt in our daily living. Audience: I&rsquo;ve got to go to bed. Thank you. Adano: Good night.</p>
<h2 id="1983-july-27---flagstaff-questions-and-answers">1983 July 27 - Flagstaff Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_27FlagstaffQandAQ2NW3 - Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s not a school, it&rsquo;s a clinic where we do holistic therapy for people who have problems and have tried every other form of therapy and then they come to us. We don&rsquo;t go out to try to heal people. The questions come up, &ldquo;Have you tried the the regular medical profession first? Have you gone to all the required modalities?&rdquo; And if they have tried them and there is no correction, we offer an opportunity to see if we can make you look at it more objectively and if in doing that it is corrected, that&rsquo;s how we operate. Audience: Are you teaching? Adano: No. Well let&rsquo;s say for instance a person calls on the phone and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak to Adano.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have an ache in my back.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;How long have you had it? Have you been to regular professional doctors and checked it out?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes. They don&rsquo;t find anything wrong, all they say is there&rsquo;s nothing actually physically wrong there. Yet the pain is there, it keeps repeating itself, and I am unable to perform my work.&rdquo; Then I would say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything for you over the phone, if you wanna come I will check it out and if we can&rsquo;t do anything for you, we&rsquo;ll try and recommend who would be the proper or competent person to help you in it.&rdquo; So they show up then we check them out. Nine times out of ten, it is corrected but one out of ten, they have to be referred to other competent people to do it. But nine times out of 10, they do have a recession in the problem and they&rsquo;re able to cope with it and correct it and it phases out. And once a month, on the last Sunday of the month when I&rsquo;m there we have a workshop in nutrition, how to eat properly. See if you don&rsquo;t know how to eat properly, you can get sick and most of our illnesses begin from improper eating. You see that&rsquo;s one of the indications in your biblical writings when Man was made, what would he eat? And so he was told what to eat but never brought forward into a workable science and so many of the people that show up at the clinic usually have a lot of problems that are related to nutrition more so than injuries and then they have to be shown how to reassess their diet and then they get well. Audience: I want to find out if you&rsquo;re giving workshops or retreats? Adano: No, the retreat was for these folks here but usually I just have the clinic and we have the workshop on nutrition on the last Sunday of the month. It&rsquo;s mostly a preventative process. Audience: I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the inner library that you talked about, how to get to the inner library or understand? Adano: The Akashic records or the cohesive memory bank of the intercellular mechanism can be tapped when you slow the brain down to about 12 cycles a second. Normally anything above 25 is considered the beta level, when you lower it down below 25, you enter the alpha but you really can&rsquo;t tap the memory bank at that level, it&rsquo;s a little too fast. Memory precipitation begins anything from 12 down to four. Now very few people can drop the 12 and those who can drop the 12 begins to tap the memory bank. Now the breathing will drop down, that&rsquo;s why one of the handicaps of meditation is that you&rsquo;re busy arguing with yourself and wondering if you&rsquo;re not breathing fast or you&rsquo;re breathing too slow, this dialogue interferes. There&rsquo;s a very good reason why it&rsquo;s there, your toxicity ratio may be the impedance for you to lower and if you drop too fast, you may disturb some of the transport time of the minerals in your body to certain organs and therefore you may go into a spasm. Now it could be speeded up like at a Pentecostal movement, you go from 30 cycles down right to about seven cycles very fast and they push you over and you&rsquo;re, what do they say? Zapped by God, by the Holy Spirit, you fall right over and you&rsquo;re in that state but your whole memory bank comes crashing in on you and time stands still, verbalization stands still, and it&rsquo;s all photography. But you have a problem trying to pick up the pieces and yet it&rsquo;s an enlightenment and the concentrated fluids in the body that are so highly refrigerated and suppressed by the different images over the years of anguish come gurgitating out like a volcano. And you start crying, you can&rsquo;t hold back this and sometimes they have to haul you out and keep you in a corner and try to get you to get back. But that&rsquo;s very drastic in terms of the meditative life but it&rsquo;s valid in terms of that it does exist. Going into it objectively bit by bit under your own control, it takes a little time to get down to that level but when you get to that level, you will start opening up as you gain more control. It&rsquo;s a whole lot better to go down slower and gain control than to be thrown into it that fast and then you don&rsquo;t have control. It&rsquo;s like a person dropping into the water to swim and goes to certain depths. He&rsquo;ll go down but he can&rsquo;t come up fast. If he comes too fast up, he&rsquo;ll get the bends and that&rsquo;s reversed now in terms of what is in meditation. If you try to drop yourself down too fast, you get the psychological bends, you see what I mean? So you have to know what you&rsquo;re doing. So you don&rsquo;t wanna go down too fast, then as you gradually work your way down, then you will able to come back up progressively. And the important thing to remember that when you&rsquo;re slowing down, if you don&rsquo;t have any way to relate to any human being as a touch base, it&rsquo;s like we say an anchor to a boat, then have something in reference to what you wanna do after you finish your meditation. If you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna meditate for the next hour and try to go down to that level and after that hour, I&rsquo;m gonna go out and do some and such a work,&rdquo; that built in program is a safety factor to a locking in of yourself in a range that you may not be competent in and it will fire you back out. So this is your own safety factor, it&rsquo;s how you program back in yourself to come back on a conscious level. So always be certain that if you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna meditate, I&rsquo;m gonna get up and do this and that,&rdquo; but do it when you get up, don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fail to do it because then it&rsquo;ll trick you and knock you out and let you down. That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll learn sooner or later that you have to live your word. 0:10 So don&rsquo;t make statements about yourself, what you will do after meditation and don&rsquo;t do it. You can try your best to do it and finish it then the consciousness will take over and fulfill and will allow you to slip down into that level. Mr. Casey used to do that a lot, he would lie on a book and all of that data from the book would be in his brain. But then he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna use this to do my work&rdquo; because if he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d get locked into it. Audience: I find when I get to that point where you stop the inner dialogue, the problem becomes I immediately say to myself, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s stopped.&rdquo; (Laughter). Adano: Guilty! You got company. Audience: I thought maybe there would be some suggestion of how you might wedge yourself in there and keep yourself more quiet, quite longer. I know that that may be the process of a lifetime. What I find is that it&rsquo;s almost as though at this point in my life,I partly become afraid of that silence or this uncomfortableness and I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I could do to not talk to myself about how quiet I&rsquo;m being. Adano: Well, from my own experiences and all the other researchers including doctor Lilly in his latest book &ldquo;The Eye of the Cyclone,&rdquo; you must make the necessary verbal programs for what you expect to do after you proceed to experiment on the inner level. You must have something to refer back as an anchoring system. No captain will take to sea without an anchor on his boat and when he comes into the shoreline, that anchor has to be there to hold (inaudible). So there are certain terms or ideas that we have to anchor into and that is where desire to perform service is a natural and a rational anchoring for the brain after researching into the self. You must set up some desire to perform some type of service that is natural to your mechanism, then this will suspend that, &ldquo;I am silent now.&rdquo; Because that is what the brain was looking for in the first place, what would you do if you get all this silence and then where are you going to apply it? You see what I mean? So if you program that you will apply your attention to something constructive after you go in that state and the ideas to make whatever you go to apply yourself to will flow easier in the process of application, you will see there is a definite link now for the first time by setting up the programming. For instance, alright you just spent an hour or whatever the length of time to come to a suspension of the dialogue but before you started, you said to yourself, &ldquo;I am going to go into my consciousness to tap possible new ideas how to work on this piece of equipment or this particular problem in my daily life and I want to get in there to have access to that reservoir of information and it flows in rational, logical when I come out in the application.&rdquo; You have to do that so then you shut off and you go in and you sit and you wait for the internal dialogue to shut down then the creative nature will come up. Now if the experience for that particular need is to occur within that specific day or time, it will come up very fast. If the experience does not occur but let&rsquo;s say in a week from now, it will give you portions of it, pushing you into a whole week to finalize the experience, you follow what I&rsquo;m saying? The data will not come flowing through ahead of its time. You may get a preview of what is possible but it will not come up, you progressively will get portions of it coming up for you to come with what you&rsquo;re doing on the rational level. Therefore you have control now for the first time that you can actually relate back inside and say, &ldquo;I am now going to bring this forward out of my consciousness and apply it.&rdquo; But you must set up something to do otherwise you&rsquo;re tapping the reservoir without any purpose. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going to your savings account to use it and there is no bill to pay. Now if you have a check in account and there was a deficiency in the checking account because you pay out a check and the check is going to be short, you can draw from your savings to fulfill the deficiency of the checking account. But something has to be missing in order for the other one to be valid for it to be released and if you do that outwardly, the same is going to go on inwardly because our outward behavior is only a reflection of the internal mechanics and the two can&rsquo;t be in conflict. It makes you more aware of how you&rsquo;re set up. So if you&rsquo;re going to create a demand and place a locking in to the supply area, which is the internal portion of your mechanism, you have to set up a demand for it to be able to feed from that level to what you need to apply. But you can&rsquo;t just say I&rsquo;m gonna go in there and then when you get there there&rsquo;s nothing for it to do then naturally it&rsquo;s gonna confront you and say &ldquo;why you got me in here for?&rdquo; Audience: I wanted to ask you also, I have a isolation thing and I do use it for meditation and I was interest in your comments about it being an inappropriate way to begin meditation and wonder when it might become appropriate or if that&rsquo;s a different situation altogether? Adano: No, as long as you set up a demand of what you will do with the energy after you tap it and what is necessary to perform that demand, that is a valid way to program yourself. You must set up the demand. You see necessity or demand is the mother or origin or the required condition for inventiveness or creativeness. You couldn&rsquo;t draw from the source or reservoir if there is no demand, what would you do with it? It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t have any bills to pay, would you take out your money to do what? You&rsquo;re only gonna draw it out when there is something to pay, otherwise you leave it there to accrue and that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re doing with the mechanism. That&rsquo;s why a lot of doctors will tell you, you&rsquo;re only using a very small portion of your brain potential. We don&rsquo;t have demand levels sufficient enough to keep pulling upon the brain potential, we have to generate demand levels. So meditation is the opportunity to go in, assess the account, assess the reservoir, and at the same time recognize the demand level. Now I&rsquo;ll give you an example in the comment I made earlier about this hotel in reference to Yogananda and the Cadillac. He was in a brand new Cadillac, that year&rsquo;s model, and yet the man was saying in his mind, &ldquo;How come if he&rsquo;s such a spiritual person, why is he driving in Cadillac?&rdquo; And he turns around and addresses the man by saying, &ldquo;Mister Johnson, I didn&rsquo;t ask for the Cadillac, it was given to me.&rdquo; And then he makes the comment, &ldquo;In fact, it&rsquo;s a very poor expression of man&rsquo;s creativity, looking forward to a better model next year.&rdquo; By virtue of this, he laid the groundwork for what? Creativity to flow to whoever is on the intake or to lock in, to have a design or an idea flow up to that brain. 0:20 So the person who was instrumental in giving him the vehicle would also be the recipient of this energy flowing back to them as a way to let them be more inventive. This is true of Jesus when he said &ldquo;The things I do, you do also.&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t say, not greater than I, and not more or less. He&rsquo;s already saying, &ldquo;The things I do, you do also,&rdquo; but then he goes on &ldquo;and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; What is that laying the foundation for? That&rsquo;s laying the foundation for more demand on the creative nature in us. It&rsquo;s like an anchorage for outlet. You have to set it up, otherwise it would not work. You have access to this reservoir but if you don&rsquo;t set up what the demand is for, it&rsquo;s not gonna release it. Once you realize that, then it will come forward quicker but until you realize that, you always shut it off by the statement, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m no longer talking, what happens next?&rdquo; You see the expectancy hasn&rsquo;t been resolved, you have to set up something to resolve expectancy then it is automatically supplying you with data. Audience: What are your views on reincarnation? Adano: It&rsquo;s valid, it would be highly impossible to create a universe and not have opportunity to resolve your mistakes. Now, let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re endowed with the power to command anything you want to eat to appear and so you command a tomato to appear and you plant it in the ground because you would like to eat another one. But by the same token, instead of another tomato coming up, a squash came up. You would call your friend and you say &ldquo;This is a fantastic thing, this is the greatest miracle, I planted a tomato and I got a squash.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll all agree with you. Yet, if you eat the squash, there is no more squash to be had. If you plant the squash and corn came up, now you&rsquo;re in a quandary, you don&rsquo;t have any squash to eat and you can&rsquo;t vouch that you had a squash. Now you see, it will be impractical for Creative Intelligence to work through such a law of surprise element without recurrence. Recurrence would be a functional law that if you plant the tomato, you&rsquo;re gonna get a tomato but to plant the tomato and get a squash and then you can&rsquo;t eat the squash because there&rsquo;ll be no more squash to plant, it leaves you in a quandary. So reincarnation is only a natural law of nature from the atomic level right down to the cellular level for cleansing the process of organisms that may delay their internal accomplishments. Now for instance let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re born and you make a lot of mistakes and some mistakes you don&rsquo;t make, so in in total of your life, sixty or seventy years, you may have had 15 non-corrected mistakes. But life terminates for you for sixty five, you don&rsquo;t have a chance to correct or make up for those 15 or 16 mistakes. All the others have been corrected so far and here you pass on not correcting that mistake. The account can&rsquo;t be closed, if in a physical rational way, you wouldn&rsquo;t do that to somebody who owes the company money, they&rsquo;re gonna send what? A bill collector to their heirs, right? To collect the the bill. Since the heirs are your own Soul nature, you will have to come back in some physical form to compensate for that bill and Eastern people have karma, the farmer calls that the sowing or reaping and Newton would call it &ldquo;for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&rdquo; Now, it&rsquo;s valid in this sense that you do something and if you don&rsquo;t complete it, you have to complete it at some other time. Now, if any reference to such an idea doesn&rsquo;t exist in other parts of scriptural writings or in other belief systems and if you look at physics from its own structure and this phenomena of repetition and self correction is not inherent in repetition, then reincarnation is invalid. The word reincarnation means merely to do it over again and correct it. Now, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; Is this your first 100,000,000 time? I once met a great Swami that came from India and this is how he greeted me when he walked into the room. &ldquo;Hi, brother of a 150,000 incarnations.&rdquo; And everybody looked but he recognized me as a brother of his over a 150,000 incarnations. Now that kind of blew a lot of people&rsquo;s mind out of focus because here is a realized man who was able to look at me straight off and we&rsquo;re meeting for the first time and making the comment, you see? Alright, let&rsquo;s take the story of Cain and Abel. Adam and Eve had a child called Cain and another child called Abel and it is said that the one brother killed the other brother. Now let&rsquo;s picture for one moment that there are only four people living, where is the justice of the dead brother going to be resolved because the other brother killed him? Where is he going to get a chance to come back and face him and say &ldquo;Hey, why did you do that to me?&rdquo; Now it said in the writings &ldquo;No man lay a hand on Cain, justice is mine saith the Lord.&rdquo; In other words, Adam and Eve even if they hire somebody or got vindictive enough to clobber Cain on his head, they don&rsquo;t have a right to perform the justice to satisfy Abel who has been hurt. Where is Abel going to have a chance to resolve or be absolved from this injustice? And where is Cain going to have a chance to face his mislead unless there&rsquo;s extended time. And extended time may not be just one body because now Cain is dead, Abel is dead, they&rsquo;re not going to meet up. Abel died before Cain, where are they gonna meet up? There&rsquo;s no justice now, everybody went scot free. Cain gone off when he passed away. Abel died, nobody made any justification for his death, doesn&rsquo;t sound valid. Yet, Creative Intelligence shows that there is a validity by extending into life repetition of correction. Now let&rsquo;s take another example. Cain will have to come back and Abel will have to come back to resolve their conflict, that&rsquo;s the extension of life. We have another example where there was a blind man. They brought him and they who brought him were various wonderful smart people, very intellectually trained and they&rsquo;re going to trap this highly realized teacher by the name of Jesus. And they brought this blind man and says, &ldquo;Tell us, who sinned that this man be born blind? Did the man actually sinned that he be born blind? Or his parents sinned that he be born blind?&rdquo; Now if the man sinned that he was born blind, where the hell can he go and sin first and be born blind? Do you see? How can he sin before he&rsquo;s born blind? Where did he live to perform something that was bad that he has blindness as a result and now has to be born blind? It don&rsquo;t make sense. Or if his parents sinned that he&rsquo;s born blind, then there&rsquo;s no judgment for that, &ldquo;I will visit the sins of the parents on the third and fourth generation,&rdquo; heredity will take its toll. 0:30 Now, if they said the parents sinned that the man be born blind, that&rsquo;s a way out for the man and it&rsquo;s a way out for reincarnation too because that would be heredity. But if the man sinned that he&rsquo;s born blind, where did he sin? And how did he live before to be born blind? What kind of function is this in nature? Or where is it gonna be compensated? Then the realized man has to answer. If he really knows his laws of reality and he cannot break a law, he has to put everything in the proper context and the answer is very valid, very scientific, and very in-depth. Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; none of the two are responsible for this man being blind. He didn&rsquo;t say that his previous life did not exist. It doesn&rsquo;t say that the parents actions were not valid, he said neither of these two is the cause that the man is blind. &ldquo;But this is unto the glory of God.&rdquo; This blindness you see here is a challenge to that Soul nature inherent in that form, if it&rsquo;s going to sell itself short of its creativeness and divinity and merely subject itself to repetitious behavior or inherited characteristics and never attempt to discover its true potential. But how is this true potential gonna have a chance to come to the surface if no other person never recognize it in them? Or enunciate it in them or point it out, it&rsquo;s not gonna have a chance. And by this, the way he heals the man is indicative that he knew more of the reality and the higher potential of the man. And what he did was simply this, he spit on the ground as a sign to say how foolish you people are in your ignorance, still trying to pinpoint one aspect of God and leaving out other aspects. And that doesn&rsquo;t say one aspect is more important or less important, there&rsquo;s more in us that we don&rsquo;t realize we have to go deeper yet. And then he rolls the spittle in a ball and puts it on the blind man&rsquo;s eye and the blind man gets well. One can say he sanctify dirt to heal dirt. This is dirt you know, 144 minerals, living dirt, holy dirt. Love it (Adano kisses himself). And the ground you walk upon is what? Holy dirt. Remove your shoes too. Get a deeper understanding of your true nature now not to sell yourself short. Good. That made them realize there was more to themselves and that they can now not be hampered by harping on the idea of past life as they drag out for all the problems that are facing them or the heredity patterns of parents, that they owe it to themselves to encounter and bring to the surface their own true spiritual potential and the way in was meditation. That doesn&rsquo;t say that reincarnation is not valid, it simply says, don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the only way to solve all the problems or that it&rsquo;s a condemnation for us to pay for our problems, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s existing as a law of encounter and resolution to a certain level of thinking, just as much as heredity exists to a certain level of thinking. But to the higher potential of your true nature, the Clark Kent that becomes the Superman by going behind the telephone booth, is what you have to uncover in you. Do you follow what I&rsquo;m saying? You&rsquo;ve got to go inside and pull off this facade of a mechanism, this verbalization, this impregnated thinking about what you think you are or what they told you you&rsquo;re supposed to be and release your internal qualities.

<h2 id="1983-july-28-part-1---flagstaff-spiritual-life">1983 July 28 Part 1 - Flagstaff Spiritual Life</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_28_1FlagstaffSpiritualLifeQ2NW3 - Audience: I&rsquo;ll say the same thing I said last night, we are simply a few Flagstaff residents who are seriously interested in prayer and meditation and their application to our everyday lives. We are not cult members. We come from a variety of professions in education, business, finance, the arts, science and technology, different levels of federal state and county government are represented among us. We have no formal structure or affiliation. In whenever we decide to to this, we all just get together and do it. However, we have been meditating together for about 10 years now and periodically we like to call an expert on meditation. This helps us to review and renew our spiritual goals in a practical way. It is our earnest hope and desire that tonight&rsquo;s lecture will enrich the personal lives of everyone present. (Inaudible then another speaker). Welcome friends, our speaker this evening was born in British Guiana, his father was Mongolian Chinese and a Buddhist and his mother Carob Indian and Spanish and a Roman Catholic. Reverend Ley&rsquo;s heritage then is a blend of two respected religious traditions. When Reverend Ley first came to the United States, he went to New York where he made his living working for a corporation. Later he lived in Canada, while in Canada he became affiliated with the Self-Realization Fellowship and taught Yoga. For those of you who are not familiar with the term Yoga, I might give you the definition from Webster&rsquo;s dictionary which says &ldquo;it is a practice involving intense and complete concentration on something, especially the Deity, in order to establish the identity of consciousness with the object of concentration.&rdquo; Usually it involves some certain postures and breathing is very important. So Reverend Ley taught Yoga and meditation classes for several years under the guidance of Paramahansa Yogananda. In 1969, while attending an East/West conference at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Reverend Ley met Swami Anand Saraswati of New Delhi India who had been one of Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s close aides in the movement for India&rsquo;s independence. The Saraswati is an ancient Yogic order and its name indicates a spiritual path through knowledge and wisdom. Adano Ley was initiated into the Saraswati order and given the title of Swami Nityananda and again for those of you who are not too familiar with the term &ldquo;Swami&rdquo; is a Hindu title of respect for a religious teacher. In Western religion we just say Reverend. Reverend Ley had spent five years in solitary yogic retreat in California before receiving this honor and while continuing his work and teaching in Yoga and metaphysics, as well as lecturing around the country, Reverend Ley also acquired an ND degree and is a licensed Naturopathic physician. Reverend Ley now lives in Houston Texas where he directs his own clinic, a center for holistic preventative therapy and instruction in self-transformation techniques. Many of us yearn for a greater sense of peace in our lives but this is not an easy thing to achieve as we go about our daily task of earning a living and sometimes dealing with irate customers and disgruntled clients and things of that nature. The attainment of peace through the practice of meditation is one of the things that Reverend Ley teaches. I believe that Reverend Ley conveys the feeling of peace. The subject of tonight&rsquo;s teaching is &ldquo;Is the spiritual life a science or a philosophy?&rdquo; It is indeed a great pleasure to present Reverend Adano Ley. (Applause). Adano: Thank you. Good evening friends. I want to make one comment of this building because years ago when I came into this area and I had my first indoctrination into Native American healing techniques and religious concepts, it was a building shaped like this that we call a Kiva and now I&rsquo;m coming back and when I spoke to my blood brother this morning he says &ldquo;You&rsquo;re back home.&rdquo; So all these are very significant to me and I&rsquo;m glad to be able to convey tonight what spirituality is. The question is is it a science or a philosophy? Well a philosophy can leave you in nebulous regions of thinking but not necessarily get down to the nitty-gritty of practical everyday living and measuring it. So often we make statements in philosophy and then we regret it because we can demonstrate it. Now when you look at science, science is very specific, sometimes it get to be dogmatic too but science has a value in this respect, science always uses definite facts that can be applied any place, at any time, to produce a desired result. Any type of information that will conform to that formula, will be classified as science. A compilation of facts that can be applied any place, any time, and get the desired result, you have science. Now spirituality would have to conform to this formula, otherwise we can discard it and say &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t match, really it&rsquo;s a philosophy.&rdquo; So tonight we&rsquo;ll try and see if we can apply or focus on facts about spirituality and apply them in the place and the time to get the results. Number one, in spirituality you have to work with your body, think of that, this human body, it&rsquo;s yours. All right let&rsquo;s find out one fact about it that is valid, that we can label and say &ldquo;this can be measured every time.&rdquo; Fact number one, losers can&rsquo;t be born. The sperm that got to the ovum, was it a loser or a winner? It was the winner, otherwise somebody would be in your place so there we have fact number one. 0:10 Anytime, any place somebody gets pregnant you know a winner is going to be born but that doesn&rsquo;t say that the winner can&rsquo;t be a loser by the environmental programming. The winner can be programmed to think he&rsquo;s a loser and end up losing but he is the winner by the mere fact he&rsquo;s born. Now remember that, that doesn&rsquo;t turn off in you, you can turn it down but you can&rsquo;t turn it off. That&rsquo;s another fact about yourself, you can turn down the winning-ness in you but you can&rsquo;t turn it off in you because the power that gave you the opportunity to be the winner is the driving force of your existence, you call it the Creative Principle. It&rsquo;s inherent in you, you cannot turn it off but you can turn down. Your willpower and your ego can turn it down but they cannot turn it off. The reason why they can&rsquo;t turn it off is a fact based on the principle of hearing, you are a hearing mechanism, you&rsquo;re a mechanism that hears and the sense of hearing cannot be turned off even after you&rsquo;re dead. You may not like it but that is a fact, otherwise no medium will call you back. If you remember Saul when he went to see the Witch of Endor in disguise and when the witch called on Samuel the prophet, Samuel rebuked Saul for calling him out from the grave. He didn&rsquo;t come to see Saul, he came to call him out. So mediums know they really have to call beings out of the invisible realm in order to make contact but then they can be seen also after they called up. So hearing, fact number two is not turned off. Number three, the moment you&rsquo;re born you make a sound (Adano makes a crying sound), it doesn&rsquo;t care what sex you are or what nationality you are, we all say the same thing, a very common fact, a common expression, and if you look at the mouth of the baby or the child that is crying, it will only expand out. But it cannot expand out like that to cry if it doesn&rsquo;t take the oxygen in and have the cord severed so inhalation and then &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; is out. That very motion of crying is nature&rsquo;s first indication that the organism, like your car out there, is turned on and the carbon dioxide is being filtered out and oxygen is going in through the cellular carburetor now known as your nostrils and your mouth. See these are facts you, can&rsquo;t eradicate them, you have to work with them. Then the mother notices a strange thing, the child does like this (Adano makes a gesture), that is telling the mother it is hungry. Of all the functions in the body, it wants to eat right away and you know it eats by nursing from the mother but like this (Adano makes a gesture). It doesn&rsquo;t open its eyes to see what it is eating, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s in a state of ecstasy and the parent is very happy. Leave the child by itself and go off and do something and should it wake up, it may cry to tell you it&rsquo;s awake but it will satisfy itself by reaching for something to put back in its mouth. Parents then have to be very careful not to leave objects around or ends up in the baby&rsquo;s tummy and then you have more problems now. Here we see a very important behavior regardless of sex, a function that the organism is reaching out to do, learn by eating. Well according to my teacher he would say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good Adano, you need 30 years of that kind of living to muck it up so don&rsquo;t get excited or don&rsquo;t try to change it for nobody, let them muck up for 30 years.&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s how you know it&rsquo;s going to be a science now and not a philosophy because they have a cluttered up toxic mechanism to correctly, to clean up and until they have that to work with, they&rsquo;re not going to believe a single word about it being a science. They&rsquo;ll all think you&rsquo;re a weirdo or a philosopher try to convert them but let them muck it up, clog it up, then they&rsquo;ll want to change. Well I hate to say the truth applies to me too, (inaudible), I used to weigh 180 pounds. I used to eat a nice good old-fashioned New York diet but that is necessary to learn. Don&rsquo;t try to change people because you can&rsquo;t change them, you can only change yourself. When the body is toxic and it gets toxic first by putting something in but you notice your parents will tell you and they have a responsibility to you for 18 years according to the law and that&rsquo;s their responsibility to see that what you put in keeps you healthy according to the requirements of the school or the environment and that you don&rsquo;t muck it up too much because it&rsquo;s very expensive, especially when you&rsquo;ve got to go to the doctor for new teeth or different parts of your anatomy, it&rsquo;s a very very expensive type of a program. So they watch you for 18 years to see you organize your life but you may not like it and I don&rsquo;t blame you either but that&rsquo;s the period you have to learn to experience confirmation, restriction, and persistency. You may not use it right away, it may be imposed upon you to set up certain behavioral functions in your mechanism. It is when you clog it up and then have to clean it up, you&rsquo;re gonna find out those disciplines are gonna come in handy but you don&rsquo;t know that until you mess it up. Now this body is what you have to work with, you can be programmed with a whole spectrum of ideas about what it is or what it is not, what to do and what not to do. Well until you get sick, you really don&rsquo;t know what to do and you find yourself very helpless and you may reach out for the closest tranquilizer which is valid enough to be there because that&rsquo;s part of the programming, you got to make mistakes and learn too. You may put a lot of tranquilizing products into yourself but still not correct the problem. Then you&rsquo;re going to get bored and angry and you&rsquo;re going to look up at the sky and shake your fist, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your fault!&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s good too because you&rsquo;re getting ready now to look at yourself objectively, not to look at yourself from a religious context be it a Buddhist or a Christian or Islam but you&rsquo;re getting ready to look at yourself objectively, &ldquo;Is there any valid use for me cleaning up myself? Is there any real reason for me to get healthy? Is there any real reason for me to want to find out what makes me tick? I can be inspired by the lives of great men, I can be inspired by the corrections of the different illnesses by people who pray but yet I may pray and not get more results, am I left out? Am I singled out never to get cured? Maybe my time ain&rsquo;t come yet to be hatched out like eggs you know.&rdquo; 0:20 So cleaning up again is another fact of time. So timing now is one of the facts about the spiritual science. when is it the time to do it and when is it not the time to do it. The brain is exposed to a great deal of data, people teach you a lot of things to do to survive and to remember in order to get through to get an education and yet somehow it seems so shallow, so inefficient when there is a depression in the society, how do you fit in? How can you cope when the prosperity level has dropped down? Then you&rsquo;re threatened with the possessions that you have and the inability to pay for the coverage of it. All of us are happy now until you&rsquo;re told in the next 10 minutes that you can&rsquo;t go into your house and sleep tonight, then you&rsquo;re gonna see everybody quaking all over the place because you start to imagine the impossible and more impossible problems that will come up because we can&rsquo;t go in and get under shelter at night. See what a tremendous pressure that is on your brain, no place to go lie down at night? And this applies to the body, why should it apply to the body? Because we have to care for it so that overexposure to the elements don&rsquo;t injure it, that puts us in states of responsibility as far as the mind is concerned, the functioning responsibility of your mechanism. How responsible are you to this mechanism? You can&rsquo;t (inaudible) and therefore you will always be praying to that fellow up in the sky, though you may shake your fist if you don&rsquo;t get your way but you&rsquo;re still asking Him, &ldquo;Look I need to sleep under some place tonight, I&rsquo;d hate to get wet all night with the rain or constantly hiding under some bridge.&rdquo; That part of your factual self comes up now, your internal attitudes. Then comes a part of you that gets what we call dreams, pre-cognitions, you can&rsquo;t help having them, you do have them, sometimes a blow on the head will give it to you, you&rsquo;ll see the light. Bump your head and you saw the light and you wonder why it&rsquo;s there, that&rsquo;s the extra sensory part of you and that has to be awakened, that has to be validated, it has to fit into the framework of who you are. And if it gives you a glimpse of conditions that will help you to better improve your existence, tell where to go and sleep tonight or where to find the next job and what to eat to stay healthy, then you&rsquo;re going to rely on it. So that part of you is going to come up and that&rsquo;s factual too about your structure. Last but not least everyone is going to walk out of the scene either six feet under the ground or go through the wall, pick your choice. Last time I saw one, they went down six feet under the ground, I don&rsquo;t see too many walk through the wall yet. So there we have something to consider, that&rsquo;s very factual about our mechanism and it&rsquo;s going to challenge us over the world, time and place, what do we do when we reach this point in time. Are we prepared for the birthday into the invisible? Do we make preparation for the invisible pregnancy? Did we make any restitution for the shortcomings while living in this visible realm and not owe anything when we go into that other realm to live. Now don&rsquo;t think for one moment we&rsquo;re going to escape anything, the bill collector still follows you, it&rsquo;s called sonics. So if it follows you all the way, you got bills to pay for a long time then there must be something that we can do. What is that something we can do? For centuries men have been calling that something spiritual life, not religious life because religious life can lead to fanaticism, it can make you walk out and clobber your fellow man to make him believe in you, that has nothing to do with spirituality. Spirituality is like the oil in a nut that can only come out after a long series of getting rid of the flesh around the nut, squeezing the heck out of the nut, and get the oil but religious life can be brushing the flower up, brushing the fruit up, and make it look nice and beautiful in the vase and say &ldquo;Here, look at me, I don&rsquo;t rot, I smell good.&rdquo; Yet inside the worm is eating his way out so don&rsquo;t get trapped in religious thinking though we have to start someplace and let&rsquo;s see if they don&rsquo;t have something to add to the process. Spirituality is what we&rsquo;re looking for and how to arrive at it but we have to work with the facts of ourselves and it&rsquo;s not something that ends up in a nebulous region, it&rsquo;s something that works moment-to-moment in a very practical simple way all around you and if it doesn&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;s not spirituality, it&rsquo;s still wishful thinking. Number one, factually you&rsquo;re born a winner. Number two, factually you communicate with sound. You hear sound waves, you compute it back to make it meaningful to you so what you say to yourself is very important, that&rsquo;s the programming of the computer. Number three, you eat your way through life and if you look, when you&rsquo;re young you eat a lot and when you get to middle age you start tapering off and when you get to old age, you&rsquo;re phasing off, you don&rsquo;t feel to eat as much. But you eat nevertheless to the last day before they phase you out, you&rsquo;re still putting something in your mouth and we as therapists will try our best to keep you going like an old automobile, we&rsquo;ll see if the gas will keep you going with the octane but that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re looking at a factual part of ourselves, what we eat, nutrition is that part of you. Again we can clog up the system and we do that when we&rsquo;re not informed and we have to clean it up because illness is the result and illness forces us to seek correction. We can blame the heavens for the illness, we can blame a lot of things for the illness but nevertheless the fact is you&rsquo;re ill and are you gonna clean it up, are you gonna quit getting ill? Are you gonna be in charge of yourself so it doesn&rsquo;t come back and dominate you or weaken you that you don&rsquo;t have any control or leave yourself helpless to it, this is the cleaning up process. In scriptural language they say &ldquo;cleanliness is next to Godliness,&rdquo; I just happen to change it a little and say &ldquo;cleanliness IS Godliness&rdquo; because I have to work with it moment to moment in my mechanism and I have to be conscious of it and Godliness is not &ldquo;holier than thou,&rdquo; far from it. Godliness is practicalness, you will discover that for yourself, that&rsquo;s why this gathering today is not a religious gathering and the friends that have invited me here are friends. I love you but I am not in love with you because to be in love is to fall out love and then I&rsquo;ll blame myself for making the mistake. But &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; we I have a wonderful relationship, a wonderful communion, very unending, very rewarding, that&rsquo;s different. 0:30 God is not in love with His world but God loves his world. Cleaning up is practicalness. All right, as far as the body is concerned and that&rsquo;s where we start, we can go to the mind and we can go to this spiritual nature but they happen to be in a range that tends to be nebulous at the moment. Investigation and research are in that field and certain data have come down but in the present moment, it will still be nebulous for us, we have to work our way through it and then eradicate or eliminate what is nebulous about the mind and what is nebulous about the spirit and see what is functional and practical and then we have an evaluation. Physically we know we are a winner, we can make ourselves losers by talking to ourselves, sonics will do that to us. Physically we know we eat and make ourselves sick, nutritional guidance corrects it but this guidance didn&rsquo;t come merely by sickness alone, it was set up before we came. If you look back to all the writings, no one would build an instrument without setting up a book of instructions on how to use it, I don&rsquo;t think any manufacturer would attempt that, right? So a book of instructions on how to run this organism already pre-existed merely called the scripture writings or Veda, the eternal knowledge but we might as well call it book of instructions on how to operate this mechanism. Nutrition is given as one of the rules of the instructions of how to operate and says &ldquo;eat everything that moves on the face of the Earth, everything that bears seed for food and for medicine.&rdquo; Well you know that can be a very broad, nebulous statement &ldquo;eat everything that moves on the face of the earth&rdquo; because you have the right to eat one another if that&rsquo;s what it means. But the word &ldquo;move&rdquo; is used, it doesn&rsquo;t say eat everything that flies or everything that walks or everything that swims or anything of crawls, it says eat &ldquo;everything that moves and has seed and bear fruit or seed for food and for medicine.&rdquo; Now certainly these men who wrote the book (inaudible) would not use such a word like &ldquo;move&rdquo; if they wanted us to eat creatures that crawl, walk, fly, or swim, they made it specific right? But they are specific when they say &ldquo;move.&rdquo; This object will not get from there to here no matter how it tries, it will grow a longer and longer and longer but it will not get from there to here until I do this, take it from there and put it here, then in essence I moved it. Now if those who know Dr. Vasant and his little dog and he comes running through the room, he&rsquo;s walking and running all at the same time. Now if I clobber him and eat him, I&rsquo;m depriving him of his own self motion. I&rsquo;m not stopping him and lifting him up and putting him in place, he has the ability to move on his own so he runs or he walks. Yet if you look back through time, Man had to eat not only what was capable of moving but he also ate things like walked, flew, and swam for survival sake thus clogging up the system by not knowing when to put it in. If he had to eat to survive, it was rational for him to catch the fish, catch the bird, catch the four-legged creature also get the fruit or the vegetable that was in season wherever he found it because he&rsquo;s a migrant person walking through, he didn&rsquo;t cultivate anything as yet. He was living strictly to survive like a child reaching out to put it in the mouth and sometimes you don&rsquo;t like to leave a dirty diaper around. So again you see the mouth has no way of differentiating until it tastes. All right, so Man had to taste to try and finally discover the practical mistakes in order to correct it. What they noticed as Man eventually got sick from putting in things incorrectly, certain individuals emerged trying to correct it in every culture but where did these men get their ideas from if everyone started out equal? How could a group of people in every area suddenly produce one or two or three individuals capable of a super knowledge to resolve the problems and the mistakes that these people are making? In each group we hear of these individuals and they call them medicine men and the word is right, medicine man. He doesn&rsquo;t do anything more than give you some medicine to ease the ache or Shaman. We haven&rsquo;t come too far, AMA or the wise owl and the porcupine or acupuncturist, we haven&rsquo;t come too far, cleaning up is where we are, the body has to be cleaned up. Okay, yet over the centuries we see men stepping out of the norm of behavior and going to the full ultimate of a behavior by certain ways of cleaning their bodies. If you put in something and it makes you sick, what is the natural behavior you would do if you saw it the next time? You wouldn&rsquo;t put it in because you know it made you sick. So innately you would stay away from it or negate it or fast from it, that means you wouldn&rsquo;t eat it or touch it. But before you do that, the little dog that Vasant has would have done it to show you so that you will learn from him. He will eat something bad and then he goes out and eats some grass and vomit it up, clean out his stomach and lie down and don&rsquo;t touch things and then you say he&rsquo;s smarter than you. His mouth got him in trouble, now his mouth is getting him out of trouble. (Laughter). So you&rsquo;re cleaning up yourself. All right you have fact number one, any place, any time that you can start the process of cleaning up yourself, fasting. For centuries Man has applied it and they all arrive at the same result that is a functioning mechanism capable of performing practical action. It didn&rsquo;t make them more religious, it didn&rsquo;t make them any smarter intellectually, but it made them practical in terms of their environment to survive. The result is factual, we are seeing now they have peace of mind because they can sleep more peaceful now and not worry about the aches and pains of a clogged up stomach, they were feeling healthier. 0:40 Spirituality is that quality of life that flows through you like a perfect timed automobile, your organism is functioning on time, it&rsquo;s synchronized and it&rsquo;s flowing without any tension. It&rsquo;s called peace that passes all understanding, it&rsquo;s not something you buy in the store or find in a book, it&rsquo;s the cleaning up in your mechanism. Okay, from the mouth standpoint you can clean up the body but you still got to realize you tell yourself you&rsquo;re a failure. You make mistakes and you may have doubts, you may have all type of arguments what to do or not to do and that is from age 1 to age 18 and you bursting at the seams to rebel and you can do your own thing you know, mother I&rsquo;d rather do it by myself. &ldquo;Well okay honey, go ahead do it by yourself and see how far you get.&rdquo; Mother ain&rsquo;t so stupid because mother has to pay the price or the cost factor for you to go on to be 18 years. So if you want to continue on your own, you&rsquo;ll find out how soon the cost factor becomes evident. Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves, our parents are essential. We may not put up with it or like it but when we look at it in terms of what is involved in a spiritual understanding, their contribution on the cost factor for our survival to give us the discipline, we may not appreciate it until we get sick and have to pay the cost factor and then we look back at each other and say &ldquo;oh mother now I understand how you feel&rdquo; or daddy and by that time the compassionate part of both are opening up, that&rsquo;s the heart. That 18 years or 21 years of frustrated living and battling not to conform leaves a lot of traumatic conditions in us and they can be programmed into all types of belief systems and yet they are not bad. For the moment they are impractical at times when it comes to facing yourself because you have to look at yourself and act and that&rsquo;s one of the things about spirituality, it&rsquo;s a principle locked into us that forces us to act what we say, like it or not. We may not do it when we are kids and we may rebel and go off but to function in an adult world with the cost factor involved, you learn pretty fast you act what you say. Otherwise nobody is hiring you and there is no roof to crawl in under the night, you see? So there again we&rsquo;re becoming conscious now, we&rsquo;re not going to end up fooling ourselves, we may end up healing ourselves and a great brother once said &ldquo;Physician, heal yourself.&rdquo; Well they&rsquo;re all physicians in the true sense of the word, it&rsquo;s knowing what to do with what you are that brings out the wonderful qualities of you. This fact about talking or saying something and acting it is what one author would call &ldquo;positive thinking,&rdquo; familiar with the book? Good, but at the same time it&rsquo;s a book of instructions if you want to take commandments, there are a group of instructions, they are positive thinking. You go full circle in the end that you have to say things to yourself and to act them. The mind now becomes stressed out by too much programming, have you ever been in a situation where you&rsquo;re over programmed and feel stressed out? The &ldquo;clatter, clatter, clatter&rdquo; the whole day and you just want to go where? In some corner to have a little peace and quiet? Good, that&rsquo;s very very necessary to the mechanism. When you are clattering clattering talking all the time, you may end up getting angry and lose your sense of happiness and that&rsquo;s what feeds the mind now. What feeds the body is the food and the cleansing of it so that you don&rsquo;t put in the wrong things to make it more sick. When it comes to the mind, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying to yourself and the constant exposure of the repetitiousness of things that makes you (inaudible). How to clean up the mind and find that part of the mind that keeps you happy? You need to have a factual principle about it and let&rsquo;s see a good illustration, happiness is nowhere to be found but in a contented mind, who has a contented mind? Anybody in this room got a contented mind? It&rsquo;s not possible to accomplish or acquire a contented mind, it doesn&rsquo;t exist but think of it this way now. &ldquo;Happiness is nowhere to be found but in the contents of the mind,&rdquo; do you think it&rsquo;s possible that you can generate happiness out of yourself now? &ldquo;Happiness is nowhere to be found but in the contents of the mind,&rdquo; equality through the verbal situations of what you say to yourself to make you feel happy and what you say in words can make you unhappy and what you say with the same words can make you happy because those are the contents of your mind, numbers and letters. They make geometry or images, they make combinations or words that mean something to you, I&rsquo;ll give you an example of happiness being the contents of your mind and not a contented mind. D-O-G is man&rsquo;s best friend, spell it backward and it&rsquo;s still the man&rsquo;s best friend. We haven&rsquo;t changed anything but we look at it the Chinese way and the Western way, left to right and right to left. You see what you did with the power of your mind? You free yourself and work with the contents and by working with the contents of the mind, you are releasing happiness out of it. So no one possesses happiness, yet everyone is essentially happy from the very contents that are contained in mind. This is spirituality, this understanding is spirituality because you can apply this any place, any time and know the D-O-G is man&rsquo;s best friend and G-O-D is still a man&rsquo;s best friend and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re male female or whatever nationally you want to be or whatever belief system you want to be you know that the alphabetical content of your brain is releasing happiness for you. 0:50 You don&rsquo;t have to impress anyone in it or try to make them believe you, it&rsquo;s not necessary. You being happy will make them think what you got, they want to know what kind of natural high you&rsquo;re living on. This is what&rsquo;s so interesting about spirituality once you understand it, not some nebulous experience in some remote part of the world, it&rsquo;s in you, the very core of you. As far as the mind is concerned and the happiness that it can release, it&rsquo;s based on the contents. Now many of us here are walking around with approximately a half of a dictionary in your brain, you realize how many words are in a half of a dictionary, let alone a whole encyclopedia that you can relate to and still more to come? Don&rsquo;t sell yourselves short, the spirituality is unending especially if you speak two or three different languages, that puts you in a wider scope of happiness. As my brother John here was saying, &ldquo;Bonjour,&rdquo; right? Good day, buenos dias, they all mean a good day to be happy yet if you can relate to all three ways of saying it, look how much happiness you&rsquo;re releasing then you begin to appreciate your fellow Man. If he can&rsquo;t speak English and you can&rsquo;t speak French, you can still shake hands, hug each other, smile, happiness is going to be released, it&rsquo;s in the mind, the contents of the mind to know to reach out, to shake their hand. Even though we may not be able to talk the language, it will convey the intent and that is where the spirituality of your brain is a factual experience that can be applied any place anytime and get the result. Now there are many techniques to slow the brain down and they all border on the range of sleep. You&rsquo;re very familiar with sleep from the time you were in the womb to the time you came out you&rsquo;ve been sleeping. So to be honest with yourself, you were more psychic than you ever thought but you never realized it, you never applied it, you never knew what it was, and then like Saint Paul said, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; He was shutting down every day, every moment, and getting into a state of semi-sleep or semi-death and experiencing something within his organism that made him happy, so happy that he could reject external enticements to be happy. That&rsquo;s why he says, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; Well the Lord must be a super fantastic excitement and since we can&rsquo;t recognize it outside, then this excitement has to be someplace else. It&rsquo;s inside of us, it&rsquo;s stored up in us, and it&rsquo;s so exciting that outer behavior doesn&rsquo;t begin to give it credit, we don&rsquo;t have enough words to give the credit to that internal excitement, that internal synchronicity. We do have dreams, we do close our eyes, and we do reflect on memories and it&rsquo;s fantastic when you think for one moment that yesterday you met me at the airport in a large airplane that occupied let&rsquo;s say this size of this room and more and you carry that whole image in your little brain for a heck of a long time, isn&rsquo;t that fantastic? But if you want to recall that image without going over to the airport and looking at the airplane again or getting a picture from them, you can just close your eyes and call it back on the screen. Now this doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do if you&rsquo;re a male or female or what you believe in or what color you are, it simply is that you know you can close your eyes and everybody closes them in the womb until they come out and keep on closing them and we close them when we end up doing nothing. So closing the eyes must have a value and I said yesterday when I was telling you folks you can either keep it wide open, close it completely, or half open. Now you may be accused of being an Oriental squinting all the time but that&rsquo;s where you can actually turn back in on your own internal image or screen and recall what you have seen during the day with the eyes wide open, that half open/half closed state. Now normally the eyes permit everyone in this room to look at, looking at is valid because we can test you and say you have good eyesight because you can look at this thing waving in the air and identify it and call it a hand, that is looking at, A-T, &ldquo;at.&rdquo; If I had it behind a glass, you would be looking at what? You&rsquo;ll be looking through and the transparency of the glass allows you to see through to the hand behind the glass, good. Now if this is possible externally for us to see through then it is possible for the brain to release this phenomenon to see through that wall. That&rsquo;s not miraculous, that&rsquo;s not religious, that&rsquo;s the real spirituality, the real atomic principle in you, seeing through. If you look at my hand, in the optical language they call that concave vision because you have concave lenses over the retina but if you look through, then you are focusing convex-ly for the first time and it becomes like a microscope or a telescope so you can see into the invisible or see through the mass to another level of observation. A blow on the head will give enough conviction that you can see through or you can take some hallucinogenic chemicals to convince you that the capacity to see through does exist. But those are not practical means of acquiring it because they have a residual danger in it, a blow on the head can be permanent, you may never recover from it. A drug may be toxic and may do damage to you and you may never get over it yet nature could not have put us together and leave us out here in the wide open to survive if it was not intended that we release this quality inside, a kind of a superman x-ray vision, &ldquo;Mr. Clark Kent, come on.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok fella but I&rsquo;m blocked by lead, I can&rsquo;t see through.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s very valid, don&rsquo;t kid yourself, whoever is writing the comic books are writing some valid facts. 1:00 The rate of the eyes can be accelerated to see through but when you will come in contact with a lead object, it&rsquo;s reduced back to the &ldquo;at&rdquo; stage instead of the &ldquo;through&rdquo; stage, you can&rsquo;t see through then. So nature has some unusual qualities allowing you to accomplish things but at the same time it restricts you in certain areas to make you respect it. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be very very egotistical and you try to show off, that will hurt yourself more than you hurt others. So their &ldquo;see through&rdquo; is a part of our spirituality that can be validated, tested, and is you. The highest spiritual nature now comes in terms of your cellular mechanism, what good is it to eat and never get sick? What good is it you can be so subtle with words and never make the wrong statement, you&rsquo;ll be a kind of diplomat that don&rsquo;t know how to say wrong, you&rsquo;re always saying yes and you&rsquo;re never going to say never. But then you come to a level where you can see through things to the point where you may become egotistical and get carried away with the fact that you can perform all type of manipulations with it, that is not sufficient to be spiritual. Though they are valid and they are factual and they can be used to be practical, it&rsquo;s not sufficient to be spiritual. We must have some physical evidence surrounding us in our environment that would give us an unbiased view of the principle of spirituality and it has to do with the cellular structure. It has been stated that when the cellular structure throws off corruption or breakdown or decomposition, when this cellular mechanism quits breaking down and takes on non-corruption, non-breakdown, non-decomposition, it&rsquo;s a glory unto the Lord, the Creative Principle. Now this cannot be just mere here-say, it cannot be something that we must wish for because it wouldn&rsquo;t be valid, it must be something that is pre-existing before we came on the scene, dormant in the life principle, waiting to be released by us when we become conscious of it, not before then. If that be the case, then it&rsquo;s valid. We have evidence of such a function that will fit, a caterpillar is a worm, all it does is eat like you and I, and then it spins its cocoon, that means it gets ready to die, and out of the cocoon emerges an unusual creature, a creature that can fly. Not crawl over the ground like a caterpillar, here is this creature that can fly, it&rsquo;s called a butterfly yet if you compare everything that actually is assigned to fly, they are not as beautiful as a butterfly. You have the most beautiful intricate designs in the mechanism of a butterfly. Now I have seen rotten caterpillars but I&rsquo;ve never found a rotten butterfly to this day. If you find one, let me know. They will crumble into power but they will not rot. That principle is in-resident in creation of the creative power within you, we can last on the scene of evolution or creation and we are carrying it in us. We have to release that in order for spirituality to be a science, otherwise spirituality is not a science, it&rsquo;s a tale of philosophy but we have living people who have done it and passed on. We have records that their body did not decompose after death. They are canonized and called Saints of all belief systems, their body is not decomposing. Now they also leave us with an unusual mechanism and at the same time they make us conscious that they were very simple, practical people. Spirituality is practicalness and transformation of this mechanism to its ultimate highest good, non-decomposition, as living testimony of what you carry within you. That does not limit the Creative Intelligence to leave a set of non-decomposing organisms here. There are evidence that many individuals never left their bodies after they reached the transition period, they took it with them. For one example there was a man called Kabir who lived in the 16th century, his purpose was to unite Hindus with Muslims. He tried his best and the day he died, the Muslim says &ldquo;We must bury his body according to our tradition.&rdquo; The Hindu said &ldquo;We must cremate his body according to our tradition&rdquo; and they argued back and forth what to do with Kabir&rsquo;s body and by that time Kabit got up and stood up and looked at them and shook his head and disappeared in front of their eyes and left them two roses. The Hindu took their rose and cremated it and the Muslims took their rose and buried it. Now you see the difference in spirituality and religious conflicts? The living organism that is carrying the inherent quality is ignored, the humanness is ignored. Now that we know it&rsquo;s a science and it can be experienced and it can be accomplished, here is the rub. Spirituality is the only science that is an art. No other art is a science to itself, yet spirituality is a science that is an art to itself because it&rsquo;s the art of living that you are accomplishing through a scientific process built into the organism that is locked in you that you have to release. Not something you have to what? Construct around yourself, that&rsquo;s the difference. It is something you have to release, every one of us including myself, has to release from within his organism and that makes it the art and that&rsquo;s what is the glory to God. His creation is an art, cannot be duplicated, cannot be competed with, and His highest expression is Man, His total inflection and reflection. Again, I repeat spirituality is the only science that is an art, a principle that you must release from within yourself and it&rsquo;s not constructed by your intellect around you but the ways to make it come forth are laid down by the factual parts of you. 1:10 The fact that you&rsquo;re born a winner, that you have to talk, provide for the body, live in the world, and go through the internal release of the mechanism&rsquo;s highest potential but you have to release it, it is your greatest opportunity to get behind the wheel. Thank you. Audience: We&rsquo;ll have a 10 minute break. (Gap in tape). Audience: I&rsquo;m somewhat familiar with reflexology and somewhat familiar with colonics but I was not familiar with Solar Nutrition, would you discuss that please? Adano: Solar Nutrition is based on not what you eat, it&rsquo;s when you eat it. I eat everything but I know when to eat it. Also you must know your blood type, otherwise you&rsquo;ll get sick. If you want to stay healthy and function and realize your reality, you must know your blood type. Now it is not what you eat but when you eat it and that includes everything in this world. Because I&rsquo;m 144 minerals, to exclude one would be a violation of my creative structure. So people who come into the knowledge of this type of eating are taken back because it may go against their belief systems but the wise man knows when to eat, not what to eat that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s always ahead of the sick people who turn to him for health. A little of anything, not something, anything is medicine for your system, too much is toxic and death. But by the same token since a little of everything is medicine for the system, you must know when to put it in. Platinum chloride is a very toxic material, we use it to cure cancer, a special type of cancer. Given at the wrong time of day, you will die of pneumonia the next morning. Given at the right time of the day, you&rsquo;ll live and go home that&rsquo;s valid facts proven by medical research now. They are slowly coming around to understand that the intake or admission of any substance into the organism is synchronized to time. I said earlier tonight, you might have driven up here with an expensive piece of machinery costing $7,500, it&rsquo;s a car. Did you pay for $7,500 worth of parts or timing? You would surely give them back the car if it&rsquo;s not running when it&rsquo;s out of time, otherwise you have a beautiful expensive antique junk. And that&rsquo;s the same that is true of this mechanism so Solar Nutrition and the term &ldquo;solar&rdquo; includes the light principles of our existence and the sonic principles behind it and it involves knowing when to put it in. Now I&rsquo;ll ask you a simple question, what food do you eat twice a day? Audience: Water. Adano: You eat water twice a day, good. Where is water formed? I see clouds, I don&rsquo;t see water till it collapses then something occurs, then it comes down as rain. It&rsquo;s a gas, yes, but there had to be a temperature change in order for it to convert into water. Now this particular temperature change can occur in light and in darkness, therefore it makes it a unique material that can be used 24 hours a day without stopping. You can never drink enough water but water is not an essential food per se in terms of growth through an organism necessary for keeping the body functioning. It&rsquo;s like putting water in your radiator, it will not run the engine but it&rsquo;ll keep the engine cool when the engine is running. Water is necessary for flushing your system, it will keep you alive but it will not give you the functioning mechanism, the protein that is necessary for cells to grow or the distribution of carbohydrates or minerals in the mechanism but it&rsquo;s necessary there like a cooling system for the refrigerating or the radiator of the car. For your body to keep cool and for it to eliminate waste products, you need it. So you can use water 24 hours a day but I&rsquo;m asking the young lady now of a solid food that she would eat twice a day. Audience: Yogurt. Adano: Yogurt, good. Before it was ever introduced in this country, it would be good to eat it more than once a day but yogurt made in this country is made out of cow&rsquo;s milk, it&rsquo;s not made from goat&rsquo;s milk where it originally began. Goat&rsquo;s milk is alkaline, cow milk is acid, you will develop mucus. Be my guest. (Laughter). Audience: What food would you eat twice a day? Adano: I don&rsquo;t eat any food twice a day because it&rsquo;s not practical. Every food is assigned a growth cycle and should be eaten once a day, therefore you have a whole spectrum of food that has every mineral necessary for all parts of your anatomy and spirituality locked into it. Before you came on the scene, the universe was set up as a spiritual principle and it&rsquo;s locked into the food already, we don&rsquo;t realize that. On the trees we have fruits and nuts. On the ground up to about five or six feet, we have animal, bird, vegetable, seeds. Under the ground we have in darkness, marine life, egg, or vegetables that grow under the ground. They all correspond to your anatomy and they all have a time to going to go in to be absorbed. Now if you&rsquo;re sick by eating out of the time cycle, then you can correct it by eating in the time cycle and nine times out of ten, people who come to me that are sick evidence point that they&rsquo;re eating foods out of their time cycle and the obvious problems they have is mucus, nerve pain, gas, dizziness, weakness, tiredness, and inability to cope with their daily life and they find every type of excuse that somebody is doing it to them. (Laughter). 1:20 If they told you that I specialize in Solar Nutrition, it is because I had to heal myself of cancer and other diseases and a broken body and I&rsquo;ve tried every other method even to lose weight. They&rsquo;re all good methods, I don&rsquo;t discredit them, I respect them all from wherever they come from but it didn&rsquo;t correct my problem. And I worked with a wonderful person who was a devout Krishna-ite from the Krishna movement. He was their number one chef, studied all the Vedantic knowledge on cooking, couldn&rsquo;t heal himself of a simple illness after following all the Vedantic studies and finally ended up at my clinic and the first thing I look at him and says &ldquo;How come you and I born from the same country and you can&rsquo;t find out how to correct the problem after studying all these religious knowledge?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re eating certain foods at the wrong time.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Well that don&rsquo;t make sense, all the food I eat is healthy food, they&rsquo;re all vegetarian.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yes, but you don&rsquo;t know your blood type. If you knew, you would quit doing certain types of foods and put them in the right time cycle.&rdquo; He went away and I didn&rsquo;t see him for 28 days. Now he&rsquo;s still their number one chef in their brand new restaurant all geared to Solar Nutrition cooking. He has taken their Vedic knowledge and regulated it to time and feed them. Now the menu is Vedic eating, vegetarian eating, but synchronized the proper timing for the first time. It&rsquo;s not a secret, it&rsquo;s knowing when and that&rsquo;s what I specialize in. Audience: What do you when you wake up at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning and say &ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;d like ice cream?&rdquo; Adano: Ah! Now we call that lunar nutrition. (Laughter). I also indulge in lunar nutrition because you see the human body is not designed to be 100% solar, neither 100% lunar. You&rsquo;re not two ovums put together or two sperms put together, you are a sperm and an ovum put together. The sperm is the alkaline part of you and the ovum is the acid part of you and you&rsquo;re 80% alkaline and 20% percent acid, every 28 days the ovum is formed and released. Now a pregnant woman would eventually wake up at two in the morning and go look for a sour pickle and yogurt and ice cream and that&rsquo;s valid because the chemistry requires that and she only does it for a certain length of time in the 28 days of the pregnancy. It&rsquo;s knowing when to put it in and therefore in this country we don&rsquo;t suffer from malnutrition or lack of nutrition, we suffer from wrong timing it&rsquo;s called potluck eating. (Laughter). Years ago on the frontiers on a Sunday all the folks would get together at the church and bring what they had and after the ceremony they would always spread the cloth out and put it all there to be eaten. Well the women will get off to themselves because they are watching their figure so they will pick and then they will discuss the latest fashions of how to weave. The men will get off and discover what to do with Jake the horse because he&rsquo;s a miserable creature and want to find a mechanical horse now. So they are busy plotting how to make the mechanical horse and get rid of Jake the real horse. In the meantime you and I are kids, we will crawl all over the tablecloth and put food in our mouth and then we get all nice and chubby. It&rsquo;s called potluck eating but that&rsquo;s valid from age one to thirty-one and you&rsquo;re entitled to muck it up then clean it up after. If you pass 31, then you&rsquo;re in the cleanup process. If you&rsquo;re not there, keep on going. You see it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to you if you try to correct the body if you haven&rsquo;t saturated it with incorrect eating, this method would not make any sense to a person but if you trace back the origin of the two laws underlying it, you will see that the wise men that gave the laws did live and these laws are still today with us. A little of anything is medicine for the system, too much is toxic. The fellow that gave that was a guy named Corn-fucious, pretty corny, Confucius. And the other one waited many many years after to discover that something was lacking in it and he came up and said one day &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time and a place and a season for everything,&rdquo; his the name was Solomon. So look how long between Solomon and Confucius men were busy mucking it up and cleaning it up until they find out timing. But by that same process we have a lot of religious ideas coming down involving the relationship to get back to the source of our spiritual nature but we cannot separate spirituality from health. It&rsquo;s highly erroneous to say a spiritual person is an unhealthy person, not true. If you&rsquo;re spiritual, you will be healthy, you&rsquo;ve got something that puzzles everybody otherwise you&rsquo;re not spiritual, you&rsquo;re missing the boat. The spiritual person is functioning on a scientific process that produces results and doesn&rsquo;t have to go off in any location to do it. Right on his two feet there he is, he can do the process of starting to clean up and he doesn&rsquo;t have to wait to be told by any belief system what to do. His own body will become the obvious thing. So Solar Nutrition is geared to time, not &ldquo;what.&rdquo; Audience: Did you hear about Norman Cousins and how he healed the illness that was in the collagen? He was literally coming unglued at the seams and he healed his illness through laughter and other holistic means. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve heard anything about gearing the kind of food or the timing of it as related to healing his illness, that&rsquo;s an entirely new concept for me. Adano: There are three types of remedies for every illness: nutrition, psychological, and placebo. Nutrition can be chemical. Psychological can be programming. And placebo is we can fool ourselves into getting well. All three work, it depends on your toxicity at the time you have the problem and your attitude to yourself. Now you see why all work? The collagen in the body can be healed by laughter for some people. It may be healed by placebo to fool himself or herself or by chemical induction or nutrition. Sickness is not what we think it is, sickness is one&rsquo;s own karmic obligation to an unfulfilled pattern not resolved in a past life that must be paid off in this life. For example, let&rsquo;s say two lives ago you hurt 15 people and you were able to resolve their hurt by meeting 10 of them and became friends again and resolved it. Five of them could not be met because they passed on and you will have to go out of the body with the unresolved five. Then you&rsquo;ll come into your next life which will be the last life and you may run into three of those people in that life and you may resolve it, you still got two more to go. But in the meantime in that last life, you bumped into another 20, you see? And you resolve maybe seven or eight out of that 20, so then you can take the sum total of what is left over and then this life now you&rsquo;ve got to resolve and you&rsquo;re only resolving it in the form of a sickness. 1:30 You&rsquo;re going to find some ache or pain, it&rsquo;s going to show up, some person is going to cause it to occur in you and you&rsquo;ll finally have to face it and resolve it. So none of the things that are happening to people and may seem miraculous, they are working out an unfinished obligation. I&rsquo;ve been in the miraculous, I fell in the miraculous, and I&rsquo;ve broken my body up but I had to heal the body or go through the healing in a non-dramatic way. My body healed itself, all the functions came back to normal except the bone (inaudible). That was on the fourth day after my accident. Then dramatically would have meant that I walked immediately off the bed, broken bones and everything would have sealed up, that would have been dramatic yet I would be a living freak today because I&rsquo;m not able to explain to you who is suffering and you would want something so dramatic that you&rsquo;ll push yourself out of psychological balance just to get that dramatic, that is not valid. The psychic or miraculous healings are for people who have gone to the bottom and out of desperation have been pushed back to have a chance to reconcile. So a great deal of their unfinished patterns are like unpaid bills they are relieved by an inheritance that came to you but they still got some more to pay so that big lump sum can fall in their lap and relinquish the debt. We don&rsquo;t know how many people we&rsquo;ve hurt or have hurt us because we have to tap the memory banks. So that form of healing is valid for that person who discovered it. Solar Nutrition may be valid for me, it may not be valid for you, see what I mean? Lunar nutrition may be more valid for you than for me, see? Again each one of us has different things to work out. Audience: Could you mention a little bit about the blood types? Adano: There is Type A+ or A-, Type B+ or B-, the plus or minus are the Rh factors. And then there&rsquo;s AB+ or AB- and then there&rsquo;s O+ or O-. Now A and AB plus or minus can be a hundred percent non-meat eaten but they cannot be a hundred percent meat eater. They will develop acidosis if they try to be 100% meat eater but they can live 100% non-meat eater. Most people who go into the spiritual life and make any headway in it are usually a Type A or AB Type. I don&rsquo;t happen to be a Type A or AB, I happen to be an O. So B and O can be a 100% meat eater but cannot be 100% non-meat eater. We develop another type of disease called alkalinosis or pain or strictures, tensions. And also there&rsquo;s an outward rash where the skin is dry but it doesn&rsquo;t weep. Whereas the A and the AB will develop another type of rash where it could weep because they&rsquo;re trying to be 100% pure in any one of the other things, it&rsquo;s not possible, nature that did not allow us to come out that way. There are reasons why we&rsquo;re like that and we&rsquo;re placed in these types to work out the karmic obligation. If you&rsquo;re going to go back to the source of your nature immediately, you may be&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1983-july-28-part-2---flagstaff-memory">1983 July 28 Part 2 - Flagstaff Memory</h2>
<p>Adano83_07_28_2FlagstaffMemoryQ2NW3 - Thank you Dr. Vasant (Dr. Vasant Merchant) and all these wonderful folks here. Memory is a vast subject, in fact it includes everything. I look at memory in different ways that you may be aware of because I had to learn different ways of looking at the English language so I break down memory into ME-MOR and then Y. Now I&rsquo;m going to spell it my way, ME-MOR-Y. Now let&rsquo;s see what we&rsquo;ll get out of M-E-M-O-R-Y and ME-MOR-Y. You&rsquo;re going to find that M-E-M-O-R-Y is going to be limited after a while, it&rsquo;s a sense of limitation involved in it, it doesn&rsquo;t reach out where you want to go and it can be very frustrating and at the same time can be very depressive and it can act like a prison. Now how will you break out to find enlightenment? If the prison should have its own freedom, then the very word should carry its own liberation. Let&rsquo;s see now ME-MOR-Y, did you break out? ME is boundless and more of ME will always make you more boundless (inaudible). You can never encompass the total memory of you because it&rsquo;s the very first two letters structured into it that sets up the container propagator and the unending potential in it, ME. Now if you want to go back into the psychological aspect of that or religious aspect of ME, you&rsquo;ll find that very first commandment to Man as a manifestation from the Creative Intelligence and intelligence carries memory, &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other Gods before who?&rdquo; Audience: Me. Adano: Now is that the biggest memory existing? But we don&rsquo;t have enough of it yet, we have to dig more into it so that&rsquo;s the other part of the ME, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s thrown upon each one of us, the MOR. How to dig out more out of me but you don&rsquo;t realize this until years after you&rsquo;re born. When you came in at the time of birth, the ME of you is temporarily shut down and if you spoke like this when you broke the ear &ldquo;Ahhhh,&rdquo; everybody says you&rsquo;re crying but you may say &ldquo;Boy am I happy I got here&rdquo; but nobody knows that&rsquo;s what you mean. Then they have to program you to adjust to your environment and in programming you rule number one is repetition, sounds familiar? And mother and father make you do something over and over and over until it ingrains itself into your memory bank. In actuality you came with a bank full of the ME in you but you can&rsquo;t express it because nobody knows what the heck you&rsquo;ll be saying and you can&rsquo;t release it but externally they&rsquo;ve programmed you to adapt. Then the conflict begins with the &ldquo;you&rdquo; and the &ldquo;you,&rdquo; everyone is like this, &ldquo;Are you you, are you you?&rdquo; And then you start comparing and then to compare you have to rely on what you&rsquo;ve been programmed by or with, numerals and letters of the alphabet. How much, what is, how many, because you&rsquo;re going to count in the numbers and what is it in terms of letters of the alphabet. The strange thing is that you don&rsquo;t seem to get out of numbers and letters yet we will create the fantastic fabric of communication that will satisfy our intellect and generate a communication between the &ldquo;you, you, you&rdquo; and totally ignore the real ME that is locked up to you. Yet periodically when you go to sleep, a part of your mechanism begins to fire up in terms of images and you wake up the next morning and you say &ldquo;I had a strange or crazy dream.&rdquo; Now to tell someone you had that, they may think you&rsquo;re crazy, it&rsquo;s hard to convey what you&rsquo;ve experienced inside of yourself. Now this crazy dream or internal photography is occurring inside of you, it&rsquo;s occurring inside of your cells, and let&rsquo;s take a little example of you wake up from a sleep and you say to someone &ldquo;I just dreamt or saw an object that looked like a bird, had wings, but in a strange way it had no feathers and yet it didn&rsquo;t move like a bird but it was flying in the sky and the object was so far away from the Earth, it&rsquo;d be highly impossible for to stay up that long and it made a complete circle around the Earth. Then suddenly it decided to descend on an open plain and land but when it landed I got a close up view and it didn&rsquo;t have any wings like the usual planes that we are accustomed to see.&rdquo; Now someone listening to you they say that you might be hallucinating or crazy and they ask you &ldquo;how old are you fella?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh 15.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re telling me this dream now, when did this dream occur?&rdquo; &ldquo;It occurred when I was three years of age.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re 15 years now and you had this dream that you didn&rsquo;t want to tell nobody?&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; And if you backtrack to age three, such an object was not in existence yet now at age 15 such an object of this boy&rsquo;s dream is in existence. A fantastic quantum leap has occurred inside that boy&rsquo;s mechanism that is making all of us ponder that we really don&rsquo;t know what a tremendous reservoir we are carrying and the memory was the label for that experience. 0:10 For the average individual he will stay on the outer crust and never investigate or he may try to throw all kind of aspirations to such a phenomenon but as we approach more and more into the atomic reality of ourselves, we can&rsquo;t do that anymore. We&rsquo;re on the verge of making another quantum leap inside of our cellular mechanism back to the real me. Everyone is questioning himself who he is, what he is, and why he is? Why should he be victimized or feel out of position in his environment and only have just a meager existence, it&rsquo;s not enough. The span of life is too short to warrant leaving yourself in that state, you want to know more, you want to get more out of life and you deserve it but where do you start? For centuries men have often told us to go back to birth as a starting place. Physiologically, memory really is in the cells but before you can look at the cell and analyze it and test it for its memory content, the very environment in which we live in is a layout or a blueprint of the structure of the cell. We may call it evolution as a label for the layout and then we may argue between someone saying &ldquo;no you were created&rdquo; and the conflict will begin with evolutionists and creationists. Those who don&rsquo;t know may side with the creationists or may side with the evolutionists. Those who really understand what is going on, there is no argument existing as yet but what is actually existing is an argument between evolutionists and in-volutionists, not with creation. Creation is valid like a jigsaw puzzle, involution and evolution are the parts of the puzzle (inaudible) but you don&rsquo;t know what the end product will look like until you put all the pieces together then you&rsquo;ll see the actual picture of the jigsaw puzzle. So the argument would be always going on between evolutionists and creationists never getting to the core of the problem. Now it&rsquo;s not possible to tap your memory in its fullest context until you refocus between evolution and involution. Now for centuries wise men have come down giving us a clue or a way back to the involutionary makeup that would disclose to us the whole memory, the &ldquo;me&rdquo; and the more of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you. They outline it by saying &ldquo;Unless you be born again, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; Now the kingdom of heaven is a reservoir if you want to look at it that way and a reservoir would be the total memory bank and another name for the memory bank could be called the akashic records where things are stored. And we have very outstanding people who have tapped into the record bank and extracted data out of it but what is more important? Not their tapping in to the bank, it is you and I tapping in to the bank, knowing how your bank is set up in you, and knowing what is possible for you to tap into your bank and utilize what is necessary to be utilized from that bank in a practical manner moment to moment. That&rsquo;s why you need to know your structure, you need to know how you&rsquo;re put together then you can get behind the wheel and drive it. If you start off with what has been accepted, that this universe (inaudible) is a result of atomic waves and these waves originally are sonics then that would validate scriptural writing, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; Word is sonics, acoustics, vibrations. What are you experiencing between my mouth and your ears? (Inaudible), that you would call the mechanical memory now, that&rsquo;s the physiology of the part in which you want to store it and confront you with it. &ldquo;Adano, is this your voice?&rdquo; You would you be totally surprised if you hear it all these years talking but now when it&rsquo;s played back via a mechanical gadget, it sounds like but you&rsquo;re not too certain. Yet that is where we are at now, the evidence is sonics and if you come back to creation that is written by the wise men we will see this phenomenon. In the Genesis, that&rsquo;s the start, &ldquo;Let there be&rdquo; sound or light, which one? Audience: Light. Adano: Okay then if it&rsquo;s light, &ldquo;let there be light,&rdquo; is sound commanding light or is light commanding sound? Sound commanding light then if sound commands light then the very core of the physiology of memory is established now at the sonic level. You come out and I come out at birth and cry &ldquo;Waaaahh.&rdquo; We are what emphasizing or qualifying our origin, we are bringing our real me back, the real memory bank back but our parents may not be qualified or perceptible enough. There are a few like that that can be qualified to recognize what is being said at that level and in the East there&rsquo;s a story that goes when the Saint Vyas had written his Bhagavad Gita and dictated it to the wife when she was pregnant, the very first attempt of sleep learning&hellip; you see your memory banks aren&rsquo;t so so new you know, these ideas seem so strange now but men have been practicing a long time to get to the memory bank or store it to pass it on and then when a child is born and grows up, it confronts the father by repeating the whole complete information. That happened in distant time, it&rsquo;s not impossible in present time, in fact in this country today many of the young people are astonishing their elders with recall of the memory bank, physiologically locked in and ready to go. If we don&rsquo;t pay any attention to it and we don&rsquo;t make a conscious contribution to learn about ourselves from within the structure, we will be missing the boat again. Birth is the doorway to look in, also the ecology how it&rsquo;s set up and they must synchronize, they must cooperate, and they must validate each other otherwise it&rsquo;s just conversation. Sonics directs light, agreed? Light is perceived by optics so many people say they don&rsquo;t want to hear God, they&rsquo;d like to see Him but &ldquo;No Man sees God and lives&rdquo; (laughter). So again the memory back is telling us something that we need to know about ourselves. 0:20 Yet in a strange phenomenon when you&rsquo;re dying and I&rsquo;ve been there and all the organisms are shutting down, all the sensory functions are shutting down, the only function that doesn&rsquo;t shut off is the sense of hearing. That&rsquo;s one part of your mechanism that does not turn off. We may be very dead, six feet under the ground but you&rsquo;re still hearing, that&rsquo;s very freakish. It&rsquo;s because of that connectiveness, regression techniques have been evolved to take people back to past life experiences because that&rsquo;s the tape. Mechanically we have it now to vouch for but then we can also add optics to it too. You see a TV came after radio, optics came after sonic. In the progression and in the memory bank the same is true, &ldquo;As above,&rdquo; which means what is visible, &ldquo;so it is below&rdquo; meaning what is the invisible is also in the visible level of your existence. So the argument is not with evolution and creation, the argument is with evolution in pollution involution only represents unseen the invisible part of nature and evolution and involution. Involution only represents unseen, the invisible part of nature and evolution only represents the unreeling or rolling off so it&rsquo;s visible and measurable. Then you don&rsquo;t have your complexes no more, you don&rsquo;t feel left out, you&rsquo;ve got to find your place in this (inaudible) from the invisible to the visible, from the sonic level to the optic level. There&rsquo;s where your real memory bank begins now but it goes back into the birth and into the structure of our environment. We come down through sonics into light then gas, firmament, all around us is gas. As far as it can go into our space, we will find gas of various types and then the gas will shift in its temperature. The lower the gas comes to the surface the temperature varies, the more it goes higher the temperature varies and those who fly planes know that, how fast the temperature shifts in different air pressures. When you come down now to the next level of gas, you get liquid and the liquid will look like a cloud in the form of a gas and yet when two clouds hit each other, we see lightning and we hear thunder. Yet strange in our thinking and memory bank you will always say lightning came before the thunder, right or wrong? That&rsquo;s not valid, that&rsquo;s the illusion because light travels faster in the media of the air, the optics register on your photographic/hologrammic mechanism of the cell registering it as being fast. But in actuality the thunder was first before the lightning because the two things have to hit first. Like when you scratch a match, you hear the scratch and see the light but because it&rsquo;s so close into you, you will say that the scratching of the match against the matchbox came first before the light. In a larger experience, you hear the thunder last and see the lighting first because of the distance you have to relate to but the two clouds have to collide into each other, strike each other to trigger the ignition. And when we come to our mechanical world and try to duplicate this, the friction action then be lighting up occurs, it is always sound before light. Now this does not invalidate what the wise men have said for centuries, in fact this keeps validating that sonics commands light to occur, it releases the light in whatever form but it releases it. so we&rsquo;re getting a structure of our physiology and we&rsquo;re getting the memory where it really begins so that we start to program it, you&rsquo;ll get better use of it now, seeing how it&rsquo;s set up, it&rsquo;s set up from a sonic level. The liquid that separates from the cloud after the crash comes down as rain but that liquid if you were to measure it or catch it and analyze it, you&rsquo;ll find substances floating in it. Also when that liquid finally lands, it crystallizes in some form. If you dehydrate it out, you&rsquo;ll find a crystal. We are essentially then crystals, one can say we are essentially soil, S-O-I-L. Now if you want to read this a little different in your writings, &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image, male and female God created them and breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living soil,&rdquo; would that be invalid knowing how you put together now for the first time? And it&rsquo;s not a desecration of your nature, in fact it is the highest elevation of your true makeup, then you can agree that &ldquo;&ldquo;Remove your shoes for the ground thou standest on&hellip;&rdquo; is what? Sacred now, you see? The soil is sacred if you understand structure but if you don&rsquo;t then you don&rsquo;t have a true memory bank to work with, it&rsquo;ll delude you, you&rsquo;ll always end up making a mess of it but if you got the true understanding of the memory bank, the real me is you, and more of you coming out of it all the time, you&rsquo;ll start to see now where it will all connect as you work with it physiologically in equipment or in the tissues. The laws don&rsquo;t breakdown, we may break ourselves against them but they don&rsquo;t break down, they are always repeating themselves constantly as the underlying link. We are crystalline in structure but what is unique about us as human beings is that our crystalline structure is in a viable state whereas this crystalline structure is in a petrified state (Adano rings a bell). It&rsquo;s not viable but this came before us, that petrification came before this viable state. We are last in the act of creation but we are the first in the quality of creation. Remember they said &ldquo;first is last and last is first&rdquo; but we never knew to what memory bank it was really applying to, finally we found out it&rsquo;s applying to what is still yet to be released in ourselves, that inner higher quality from what is locked up in the memory bank of ourselves. 0:30 So when the wise man tells us to go back to birth as a starting point, he&rsquo;s giving us the clue of how to look at this physiological vibrant mechanism with all the minerals locked up in it and to understand its ability to record or store data. Now we are a year old in the womb before the cord is cut but we are not an individual, we are still an attachment to an organism that is providing the problems and the hosting of it. The sperm is in the father, maybe X amount of months or years, and the ovum is in the mother but when they bond then you have the pregnancy and the nine months of your mother carrying the pregnancy. But we are not two ovums, neither are we two sperms, we are a sperm and and ovum. These these are actual life forms that carry on a fantastic job of bonding to form a human mechanism like this. Now if you look at an ovum and a sperm under a microscope you couldn&rsquo;t give it credit for memory, not when you look at a human being standing next to it. You say to yourself &ldquo;that has memory?&rdquo; But then (inaudible) may look at you and say &ldquo;Yeah if you can see the mite that&rsquo;s next to it, you need a more powerful microscope&rdquo; then you may find something about memory, deep encoded laws working inside that cellular organism waiting to be released. Yet it forms this body, sets up this fantastic machinery in such a fantastic way that you&rsquo;re amazed at how a whole human body can command one molecule of hemoglobin to move through the skin and if you begin to think of all the different minerals and vitamins that have to move on command in your body to keep you going, that&rsquo;s a fantastic memory reservoir. Now equipment came late and was beneficial to modern Man. Early Man didn&rsquo;t have equipment to rely on, he had to go back to what you would call the crazy dream state of the youth who saw the shuttle before it was invented and that&rsquo;s where early Man went to, he went back inside with his internal mechanism to look in. Memory is in the cell, you can program it by repetition from after birth but here is a strange phenomenon of memory in yourselves. Those who heard me last night I made a remark by saying &ldquo;No one is born a loser, everyone is born a winner.&rdquo; That may sound philosophical, psychological, but now let&rsquo;s look at it physiological in terms of memory. The sperm that got to the ovum was a loser, right or wrong? Wrong, right? Now you can&rsquo;t argue with physiology because you wouldn&rsquo;t be here to be talking to me so the sperm that got to the ovum and the innermost core of the ovum that was essential for it to lock in and become a human being was the winner. But by the same token if you go all the way back into the structure of your makeup and you look at how sperms are working towards the ovum, you will see every behavioral pattern exercised by the teeming masses of sperm that you couldn&rsquo;t realize that outside in the outer world that&rsquo;s very very small of what we will call the brutality and the abuse of the outside world in comparison to what is going on in the inner world. Yet the law says &ldquo;As above so below,&rdquo; what&rsquo;s going on in the invisible must go on on the visible level. We have an unfinished tape of memory yet waited to be released out into the visible so if we are violent in there and we come out here and appear to be violent and we&rsquo;re trying to regulate the violence and claim wrong reasons for the violence, that wouldn&rsquo;t be valid. We have to go to the memory bank to see if the violence is a part of the process of evolving and that it&rsquo;s not a negative condition or a positive condition, it is a required process where organisms must interact to be evolved and your condition which you call fight or flight sensation, where did it originate? After birth or before birth? Yes, before birth but you don&rsquo;t know or remember that until it&rsquo;s activated in you and to go back to that level and that&rsquo;s why the wise men say &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;re born again you can&rsquo;t enter the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not some glorious nebulous place where the Lord is sitting in some antiseptic corner waiting for you, God is the envelopement of everything that He puts out. But passing back through those levels of the memory, it may be challenging to your logical thinking but as far as your sensory makeup is concerned, no, it withstood the pressure of the centuries of time to formulate into an organism to make you. That&rsquo;s why anytime we go inward to the source of the memory banks, we seem to perform a strange behavior from the outside world. The outside world sees us do this (Adano does something), when you go to people who have an ability to tap the memory bank, an adult especially may look at you like this. &ldquo;I see a green pasture.&rdquo; This behavior if not understood by some people, you may think it&rsquo;s some kind of illness or you&rsquo;re delirious. Yet this form of slipping in and out of the memory bank is part of the process, it&rsquo;s a form of duplicating sleep which is a mini-death and then our friend Brother Paul would say &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; What is he really doing? He&rsquo;s dipping into the memory bank of his real self, the Me of himself and getting more out of it so if you think you really enjoying yourself by the evolutive nature of yourself, wait until you get to discover the involuted nature of yourself then you&rsquo;re really enjoying it all. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trying to get us to recognize, living and dying daily meaning opening and shutting the eyes, slowing the brain down, bringing it back to the norm, and dipping in to study the cellular structure. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for, to study, it&rsquo;s an internal TV set. One can say today we spend our lives sitting behind a TV screen from morning until night trying to get programs, ancient Man might be looking at the cellular TV set from finding out the origin of programs. As you dip in to this memory bank then we will start to see strange phenomenas coming up that may challenge you in terms of the chemistry, the actual chemistry of your makeup becomes obvious now. They may not be accepted in the outer world but they are there and it constantly confronts you. You may make notation when you come out then you have to go prove it if you&rsquo;re lying to yourself or if these are hallucinations or if they are valid. 0:40 By the same token a quantum leap will occur at that physiological level that you may perceive a way to measure those substances inside, bring it out to the outer world, develop a type of mechanical gadget that will validate it and then it&rsquo;s called an invention. Then that&rsquo;s the first breakthrough from the logical level to the biological level. Now we can measure back. Each one of us has access here but we don&rsquo;t use it because we&rsquo;re not aware of it. The environment will force us more and more under necessity to get there, then we will realize that necessity is really the mother of the invention, is really the mothering agency that pushes us back into our memory. The more the need gets stronger, the more we&rsquo;re going to look for something to offset it for the solution but the solution is found in what we openly call creativity, yet when you get to creativity you&rsquo;re surprised that creativity is waiting for you as a memory. You see what kind of a problem we get into? We find ourselves returning to a memory bank, more of the Me in You already locked up, already stored up, ready to be released if you are prepared for it and if the necessity is strong enough to enhance it to leap forward. Then you can go into the measurements of the brain, the two halves of the brain, and see how they coordinate right down to the various movements of the body. In my type of work where I have to deal with people who are hurt and don&rsquo;t require any medical tension from the standard methods, the x-rays don&rsquo;t show any breakdown in the bone structure, various (inaudible) don&rsquo;t show any deterioration in the tissue, yet the patient complains about a pain that keeps recurring in that area of the injury. We do every kind of testing but then the patient still complains, is the pain of fantasy or is the pain a feedback from a memory bank? In a strange way we do identify the pain from a memory bank because we have ways to look at the pain communication. Now before we approach it in terms of mechanical gadgets to measure the memory bank of the pain, wise men of ancient time, we used to call them the Oracles or Seers, See-r is to see right through. Today we call them psychics or para-psychologists, you could go to one of them and they may look at you and they will see the outer electrical field of the body and they will say you will have a blue aura today, that was their way of diagnosing the memory bank and then they may ask if you had some disappointment lately? And he said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and then you may define the disappointment but they were able to pinpoint in you from looking at the electrical field, your predicament and it&rsquo;s storing itself in your memory bank and it&rsquo;s now aggravating the mechanism and the pain sensation keeps coming up in the location of the injury. That at one time was considered ritual or shamanism and medicine man and they use the term correctly among the American Indians, medicine man, and that&rsquo;s all he was, a man who either relied on herbs or the inward sight to look at the problem from the memory bank to solve the patient&rsquo;s problem. Today we&rsquo;re approaching it more in the mechanical validation and the Kirilian camera comes along now as a mechanical device to actually look at the electrical impulses being given off in certain areas. Now let&rsquo;s say this is a healthy tissue, the memory of this tissue is that one milligram of Vitamin A must travel across my wrist to my little finger every four hours by command of the brain and unless it goes there, this finger will not be performing efficiently. Every four hours one milligram must travel (gap in tape)&hellip; milligram every four hours. It&rsquo;s like this house, this house is not built by sheer wishing, a blueprint had to be drawn up then the parts are put together and the house functions but the blueprint doesn&rsquo;t tell you how the tenant will behave in the house. That&rsquo;s the thing you have to consider now, the blueprint only gives you how the house is structured out, you the occupant is the consciousness. You the occupant is the force field that came in when the cord was cut to make it enhance, dilate and constrict to a rhythm but the structure, the blueprint, is already set up and you can tap into it and get to that force field. Okay, agree that one milligram has to travel across a certain area to nurture that area to be on time, then externally something comes along and hit it and there&rsquo;s a sensation of pain, it registers on the brain. You go to the doctor, the pain is so terrific that you can&rsquo;t stand it, it swells up. You go to the doctor x-rays it and says &ldquo;no broken bone&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s swollen because of the impact and there&rsquo;s certain life forms in there that are going to be not performing on time. Now if he measures that vitamin distribution he says &ldquo;well it&rsquo;s not going there every four hours, it&rsquo;s going there every six hours and you&rsquo;ll need more Vitamin A to go through to compensate for the swelling.&rdquo; Your memory for that amount is demanding and the brain is triggering the sensation that it&rsquo;s not getting it so it&rsquo;s quivering, it&rsquo;s hurting, and so when you put it in then you find the alleviation be it a vitamin or a mineral or whatever it is that is required, it&rsquo;s off its timing. The reason I&rsquo;m trying to get timing to you at the physiological level of the memory, it will play an important part to understand memory at the psychological level and at the spiritual level but until you recognize timing at the physiological level or it&rsquo;s structured into you already, you will not appreciate your memory how it works via the psychological level, let alone how it works for you via a spiritual level. The Creator, like every manufacturer, made a beautiful piece of equipment but the last thing He did to it was timing. Now all of you who came here have driven in beautiful cars, you paid a lot of money for it, but did you buy $6,500 or $7,500 worth of parts or $6,500 or $7,500 worth of timing? Now that&rsquo;s locked into the memory bank so intricately that our outer world cannot operate without it. That timing is very physiologically locked in, psychological, and spiritually locked in, it has to be there because that&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re going to really be satisfied with. When the person hands you the key and you turn the engine over and it doesn&rsquo;t work properly, you&rsquo;re gonna hand it back to him. All right, knowing that timing is involved in your cellular structure and it has to do with the transportation of all the material through on time to make this organism behave as an organism, then when it is released at birth and the cord is cut and the air is taken in, if it doesn&rsquo;t breathe or retain that air, that timing is off we have to do either artificial respiration to get the timing but when the timing is off permanently, it&rsquo;s off, the mechanism would not work, it cannot contribute to its environment, the timing is off. 0:50 When the timing is synchronous to the organism, it&rsquo;s a human organism that is moving and having its freedom in the environment. Now what is locked into the psychological bank of that organism is what will come from how you program it. Now if the parents program data in before birth at the pregnancy level, that&rsquo;s a fantastic amount of data stored up in that psychological makeup so we see now the offspring will come out acting out these particular data. If we program after birth, the offspring will act the data entirely different because that&rsquo;s after birth not before birth. Then there&rsquo;s a connection between how parents react before pregnancy and after pregnancy and how the organism responds before pregnancy is over and after pregnancy or during pregnancy. We call the post natal and the pre natal levels: post natal is after, pre natal before. In the prenatal period if the man and the woman had a fight in the fifth month, invariably, and there are enough patients on record, they show up with problems that go right back to that fifth month and in sequence of five numerically, in the every fifth year or every fifth month of the year, some incident comes up and will zero in on a specific part of the anatomy. That psychological anguish registers into the physiology and it feeds back to the memory bank as a problem. Now the therapist has to work with many ways to diagnose it, we may use a Kirilian camera to ascertain the type of shock from the wave around the anatomy and why did the shortage, the appearance of the glow and the color spectrum and then we start zeroing and if the parent is alive, the child can call the parent and validate it. Many times the parents are amazed that their children will ask them what took place at such and such a time in the pregnancy and when the parents tells the child, because the child is already an adult now and it&rsquo;s not afraid to admit itself or look at itself, the child is able to convey to the therapist and then the therapist can match all the data and show why that is there. Now imagine that is only occurring in the present body form and illnesses that are of the prenatal level, there are illnesses that go to the pre-incarnation levels. Since we don&rsquo;t shut off the hearing and life is not lost, we can&rsquo;t lose life, energy is not created or destroyed, it&rsquo;s ever inherent, present, and carries all the memories of it, we can start picking up the connected awareness in the various forms that did not finish their commitment. That&rsquo;s how come the term karma, you pay off every bill, there&rsquo;s no something for nothing in this universe, you may not like it but that&rsquo;s the way it goes. We may live 60 years of our life, hurt many people, and then suddenly come to realize we must make restitution for it and we try our best to make restitution and yet we end up owing five people because those five people may have passed on or gone on to some place where we can&rsquo;t make any restitution to them. The time comes for us to leave out of the frame, there&rsquo;s no unfinished bill, &ldquo;what you sow, you reap.&rdquo; We are put back into the same law again to resolve it, it&rsquo;s not a bad law, it&rsquo;s not something negative, it&rsquo;s that you can&rsquo;t operate a universal force field without setting up certain natural laws for its continuity and the memory bank is locked into it as a reminder like a bill collector to come get it. Psychologically you come back again and now we have different behavior patterns at the psychological level of the memory. We tend to drift away in daydreaming, we tend to hear noises, we get certain fuzzy images while in the midst of looking at things, this is a psychological memory trying to inform you of something that is not complete in yourself. When we don&rsquo;t understand it, we may classify you as a sick person until it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense that you&rsquo;re not really sick, there is something that is not working the way we have been programmed to accept it to work only to find out it&rsquo;s doing its own laws and that we have to get back to understand that this person may be going through a self-healing on their own from their own self-programmed memory bank before they left the last life. They wanted to make restitution, isn&rsquo;t that what I said before? But the five people that are gonna make the restitution aren&rsquo;t there, the unfinished psychological pattern is now trying to come to the surface. So we may end up having all of a sudden a hologrammic view of the room or we may hear that somebody is experimenting with drugs, just for curiosity we may indulge and bang, the whole geometry and geography of the brain suddenly flashes open and we see various images going through us on the psychological level. But there is a danger, the Yogis of the East did not say that drug was not valid, they knew it was there, it would be erroneous to believe that we are so smart today and invent of better drug. Plant has always been here, minerals have always been here, combinations is Man&rsquo;s curiosity. So the drug experience is not a new experience but it&rsquo;s not an experience of looking at the internal memory bank in terms of healthiness simply because it has a residual toxic reaction to the mechanism and it can be out of time. We don&rsquo;t know enough chemistry, what we will call chromo or chrono biology, biology geared to time and the mechanics of how they&rsquo;re time formed, time-related, and how this cellular mechanism is time-related. So we may hurt ourselves more by the chemical induction to look at the memory banks. A few of us may escape it (inaudible), because their timing went off. Yet the wise men knew that the Creator could not put us together, leave us in this peculiar mannerism if It did not intended for us to move on to another level which is a spiritual memory bank, looking at the memory bank from the spiritual level now and tapping into it but must also provide natural means for the tapping in to the memory bank of the spiritual level. 1:00 What good would the Creative Intelligence just make us a biological object and turn us loose and then to conflict ourselves with psychological gains? That would not be a valid thing, the spirituality has to come out of it somewhere and that&rsquo;s what we eventually end up recognizing why the realized Man appears on the scene periodically extolling the spirituality of the memory bank. That&rsquo;s your Divine Nature, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you and the more of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you. They come plugging away at this and they become so adamant at times you think these people are very fanatical that they want you to look inside and get back to that memory bank. The more of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; in you they go to the extent of making their own personal lives a model of how they tapped in and yet they leave us with simple rules of tapping in so simple at times it makes the intellectual person disgusted by hearing it. It sounds so boring hearing such a simple idea, getting born again but if the intellectual person isn&rsquo;t carried away with this simplicity and looks at it more objectively from a standpoint of terminology and into the physiology of it, then you&rsquo;ll uncover the reality underlying it. Then he will also see that the method though simple is the most natural, for every invention that ever came out, the laws or the ideas underlying it are very simple things when we finally put it together, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that before? You ever heard that statement? And it&rsquo;s so simple, so obvious and yet you miss it. That is why we can&rsquo;t just shut it out, we have to look at it more objectively. Birth is the doorway to the physiological study, all the anatomy makeup is the physiological study, the psychological relationship is the feedback of the unfinished ideas. This is not our first and last time, if it was we don&rsquo;t have to live this way, we can push Mr. Reagan off his seat and sit at his place. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not the first and last time, see? If it&rsquo;s the first time, you can go and do what you want because there&rsquo;s nothing to account for. What is there to account for? If it&rsquo;s the last time, it&rsquo;s over, you might as well be as belligerent as you want to bem obnoxious as you want to be, there&rsquo;s no need to be holy anyplace, you follow? The logic is there but innately you sense it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, regardless of how much programming you have to behave as a rational person, it don&rsquo;t make sense that this is the first and last time because you wouldn&rsquo;t go up and hit the person right like that and push him over and take his place. Deep down inside something is recurring and making you think back, more of that &ldquo;me&rdquo; go in finding out what is hidden waiting to be released. So the psychological aspects of memory don&rsquo;t end with the mere hurts in the present time, they don&rsquo;t end with the prenatal level, they are carryovers from unfinished commitments in various forms that we were in, it&rsquo;s a tough thing to catch up with it. If we all look back at Cain and Abel and Adam and Eve as the first real matrix for this thought pattern of psychological feedback, Adam and Eve their first child was Cain. The second child was Abel, Cain kills Abel then the Creative Intelligence says &ldquo;Vengeance is mine saith the Lord, no man lay a hand on Cain.&rdquo; That mean Mom and Pop can&rsquo;t clobber the hell out of Cain for killing Abel, right? When is Abel going to get any restitution or being absolved for being hurt that way and when is Cain going to have a chance to absolve his mistake if it&rsquo;s the first and last time? The unfinished thought pattern in the life form has to have a form again to carry over to resolve. But you see the timing is thrown off and once timing has thrown off, the whole mechanism is going to be off time and yet the same timing that is thrown off will reconcile itself in a given time but when two people come together for the first time in this present form, there&rsquo;s a sudden recognition and they don&rsquo;t know why. You&rsquo;ve never felt that? Walk in a room and you&rsquo;re seeing someone and you feel you know them but where do you know them from? That psychological part of you is recalling. Now it&rsquo;s here we make the quantum leap into the spiritual, it&rsquo;s at that moment of meeting. We&rsquo;re going to deal with numbers now, a young person and an old person meeting for the first time and the alphabet of the language of saying &ldquo;Hi, hello.&rdquo; These are two people in the room meeting for the first time, A is 60 years of age and B is 30 years of age and A speaks to B and says &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; and B responds &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; Because of their age difference, zeroing on their past life performance we find that their contact in present time is an unfinished commitment to each other in some life form now being resolved. The older person speaking to the younger person is catching up with the unfinished thought patterns and resolutions. If the younger person speaks to the older person, that&rsquo;s B speaks to A and says &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s very hard to validate that it&rsquo;s a past life experience but it can be validated at another level of our mechanism much more closer to our present form. Remember I said losers can&rsquo;t be born, winners are born, but there are many runner-ups and you may have to push one of the runner-ups out of the way to be ahead of the game, &ldquo;Ah! See you next time. My trip not yours but I&rsquo;ll make up for it!&rdquo; &ldquo;You better.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;s swearing at Daddy for performing such an erroneous operation in that mechanism for releasing all these forms of life to battle for survival. And the one that&rsquo;s gone ahead will be older than the one that&rsquo;s left behind to phase out but nature will take care of every form and compensate every form and bring it to face itself on the spiritual level. The spiraling principle within, that&rsquo;s the spiritual life. The one that is left behind gets born again but not in that same form because they are no used ovums, the ovum are only used once so every ovum is a virgin. You see nature plays tricks on us but he plays more tricks on us by labelling it incorrectly. Every ovum is virginal, used once, then the sperms are phased off to go into the laws of recycling and they come back through other body forms and let&rsquo;s say A has gone ahead and left B and A was a caucasian. B was also with A at the time when the battle for survival but A managed to be the one that moved in to become born and went on to be number one. B is left to be cycled out into time and space again and B ends up in an oriental body, way across the continent of another country. 1:10 And 40 years after, A and B are meeting at the congress of international businessmen to discuss computers. In walks B and sees A sitting at the table and says &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; as if to say &ldquo;You remember me?&rdquo; You sense you know him but where do you know him, how do you know him, and suddenly he blasts you with a &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; And he looks so vibrant and you say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just another brash kid.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s that, it may seem as a casual exposure to life but there the spiritual memory bank is working now because if you track down their relationship, you see one younger than the other, and they may end up being so closely thinking of similar ideas that they &ldquo;hit it off&rdquo; as you say. But they can be tracked back to where they separated in time and one going ahead, one left behind to pick up again at the spiritual level to resolve their feelings. At the same time we have another problem at the spermal level. Every ovum is numerically numbered and can be accounted for but the sperms are not so easy to be accounted for in the man because ovum is released every 28 days from the time of menstruation to the time of pregnancy, right or wrong? If it doesn&rsquo;t ovulate in the 28 days, it&rsquo;s phased off for the next, agreed? Good. All right when the woman begins to menstruate at let&rsquo;s say 12 or 12 1/2 to her very first pregnancy and if she counts every month as one, she may end up having menstruated 120 times which will put her in a certain age level for 120 months and if that&rsquo;s her first child, that&rsquo;s 120 in her mechanism. Now picture for one moment this mechanism doesn&rsquo;t have helter skelter operation, everything is synchronized by laws of physics, spirituality, and psychology. &ldquo;Ovum 120 calling sperm 120, come in sperm 120.&rdquo; (Laughter). Then the husband and wife they&rsquo;re there one afternoon and they&rsquo;re looking at each other and they decide they&rsquo;d like to romance each other and lo and behold she&rsquo;s pregnant. Yet he may have released thousands of sperms and she has one ovum to be ovulated and it&rsquo;s ovum 120. Rest assured that sperm 120 got there, pushing all the rest out and he may be the lazy son of a gun, sleeping down on the bottom of everything in the pile heap but he pushed in there to get to the ovum because why? His number is up. (Laughter). Spiritual memory can be very very hilarious and exotic and at the same time very factual but he got there. But by the same token you have another problem there, ovum 121, ovum 119, they are going to be runner-ups with ovum 120, right? And they&rsquo;re gonna give 120 a run for the money. Sometimes the ovum can dilate and have two openings but it&rsquo;s originally a 120 ovum. It can be a 120 dilation being an A and a B part, 120 is destined to go in there but 119 is faster than 121. &ldquo;No greater love than he who would lay down his life for his fellow Man&rdquo; is a saying which we think only applies after we&rsquo;re born. Not valid, it applies before we&rsquo;re born because that&rsquo;s where we are going to find out real trust. 120 innately now it&rsquo;s going to slow down knowing that (inaudible) so a phenomena of twins are going to occur. 120 is supposed to go in first but then it sees 119 is so close and then 119 is recognized by 120. 120 says, &ldquo;Well okay, if the ovum is already opening up for us to come in, then we&rsquo;re going to share the ovum.&rdquo; 120 is going to slow down for 119 to catch up and they both have to merge and lock into the mechanism. It&rsquo;s like a docking device in space between a satellite and the mounting equipment. That docking is the test of 120 to 119 because 120 is giving up preferential position for a coordinate position. &ldquo;No greater love than he would lay down his life for his fellow Man.&rdquo; He knows he&rsquo;s the winner, he knows he&rsquo;s got to take a chance and let this other fellow come in. Now the other fellow may be coming correctly on time to match 120&rsquo;s slowing down and they both merge at the same speed and out comes the twins. At the point of delivery, 120 is going to go out first and 119 is gonna follow in sequence but not always this particular slowing down occurs. &ldquo;No greater love than he who would lay down his life for his fellow Man&rdquo; has its quirks. It&rsquo;s in the timing, 119 may forget his accelerator and flick past 120 a split second too soon. Though it would slow down for him to come in, he didn&rsquo;t regulate his momentum to merge in the ovum. There is where Creative Intelligence plays justice, they lock off, offspring is siamese twins and you will always see one portion of the head a trifle higher than the other and you know who is the culprit. (Laughter). Spiritual law is validated now, spiritual memory bank becomes obvious to you now. What this is all telling us is that our outer life has to be reorganized to resolve these conditions of the memory bank and the memory bank is only the bill to be paid and it&rsquo;s paid on the outer life where you sweat it out. So if you owe a bill and you have to pay it, the physical body is where you work off the bill. Thank you. Audience: Maybe we should have some questions and answers. Does anyone have any questions of Dr. Ley? (Gap in tape). Adano: &hellip;programming, also there is the tape deck replay when you&rsquo;re asleep for increasing the memory. The thing is this, the memory banks of the brain are all over your cells, every cell is a memory bank. There&rsquo;s no way you can escape it but they are assigned specific operations in various parts of the anatomy. Your eye is assigned to see here but that doesn&rsquo;t say this cell here doesn&rsquo;t have the same capacity to perform that function. It does but it&rsquo;s not assigned to do it right now until called upon. We are a reflection, that&rsquo;s how reflexology came into existence as a way of touching different reflexes and getting the same response. We are a reflection of this whole cosmic makeup and we are a walk-in memory bank, more of it is what you want to release but it&rsquo;s knowing where to tap in so you can get the use of it. Since the brain nutritionally is set to release memory, nutrition is already organized to nurture it and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so important about nutrition and the type of minerals that are necessary for the brain to function efficiently. 1:20 They say an elephant has a memory that he never forgets, right? If you follow an elephant and see what it feeds on and the type of minerals that are in the plant that it eats, the food is mostly Gota Kola. It&rsquo;s the plant that they eat a lot and the minerals are very high in germanium which is a very small crystal that is found in the lobes of the brain that has to do with communication, you use them a lot in your computer work. But we don&rsquo;t get enough of that in our normal diet, they&rsquo;re trace minerals, we have to reinforce it so we reinforce it in our regular eating by taking the Gota Kola or we can take the Ginseng, another root and we take Inositol, that&rsquo;s an extract and it enhances the memory bank. Now certain foods are assigned by nature for the brain, high in phosphorus which the brain needs, you find that in marine life. Now it&rsquo;s strange that in a marine life there&rsquo;s a high concentration of phosphorus in their mechanism yet when you look at yourself we may pride ourselves as being mammals at this stage of the evolutionary law but were we not marine life before we started off? We made the transition from marine to mammal but we are slowly phasing it down in place of preference. Now you want to store data, you want to accumulate more data, that&rsquo;s a preferential condition at the demand point but what is already stored, you&rsquo;re ignoring. To get more in is to make associations, you can remember data faster by associating it. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. All right there are nine numerals, zero is the exceptional numeral that can be cut and put into shape to make all nine, you follow me so far? If you take the zero, it can make one, it can make two, it can make three, four, in any shape. Here&rsquo;s a zero, cut it in half and you got one. You twist it this way you have two. You twist it this way you have three. You twist it this way you have four. You twist it this way you have five. You twist it this way you have six. You twist it this way you have seven. You twist it this way you have eight. And you twist it this way and you have nine. The same zero did that. Alright, we don&rsquo;t seem to have any more numerals to work with, right? We are confined to these 10 numbers. In the english language we are confined to 26 letters yet the same zero can make all 26 letters. From the way I showed you how to start from one to nine, you can go through the same mechanics of taking the zero and making the 26 letters. To store only that in the brain and command a vocabulary to communicate is fantastic when you realize what a computer you have but it&rsquo;s the association patterns that make it unique, how you associate with it. If you take one to nine and you put a letter under each of it, the first nine letters will what? One is A, B is 2, C is 3, D is 4, right? E is 5, F is 6, G is 7, H is 8, and I is nine. Now remember the first and last letters are A and I, one and nine. When you look at your hand you&rsquo;ve got the computer all set up already. Now if you take the next nine letters, J will be under A and under 1, and R will be under I which is under nine, count it up. JKLMNOPQR. See how fast you got it? 2 times 9 that&rsquo;s 18 already, there only 26, you need eight more. So S will fall under J so AJS is 1. Z will fall under 8, it will not fall under nine so you have I-R as the last two letters, A-J as the first two letter, and the bottom line is S-Z, then every one is only three of each and if you had that put out in front of you now, you have a framework of a computer module working in your brain now and then the interplay of numbers and letters sets up the communication and sets up the coordinates and associations. And if you&rsquo;re going to read any subject, you&rsquo;re going to deal with the letters of the alphabet. Let&rsquo;s say take the word cat C-A-T cat. Taking from your framework C is the third letter right? A is the first so on a computer that would be 3-1 and where will T be? Two, exactly. That&rsquo;s very good because you see you&rsquo;ve already got the framework of reference that you can now plot out memory retention for data and surprise the teacher because if you start reading data, you&rsquo;re going to be reading words because they&rsquo;re only a combination of letters to represent ideas but they&rsquo;re also going to be numbers in their context so since we&rsquo;re always thinking numbers and letters, it&rsquo;s faster to pull it together as a computer now and utilize our germanium mineral chip that we have here that everybody&rsquo;s trying to copy and utilize it quicker. So you can start zeroing in on more data faster by the association. All right let&rsquo;s say now you saw the word &ldquo;caterpillar&rdquo; and if you want to make the association then you have &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and &ldquo;pillar.&rdquo; A pillar is a post and the cat is an animal and the cat is supposed to be able to scratch and a pillar is a very heavy thing standing upright and if you get a caterpillar, it can be either the worm you&rsquo;re inferring or the machinery that is digging up the ground, you&rsquo;re making your own association from the word. So we started off using the word memory, m-e-m-o-r-y or ME-MOR-Y. Various associations open doors for you and the more you can associate, the more you retain the data and the more use you have for the data. That would be your best approach in speeding up and retaining by association plus the nutrition where you can enhance the memory bank. 1:30 Now I&rsquo;m going to ask you a crazy question. You study and memorize, what time of the day you find it very easy to memorize? Now we&rsquo;re talking timing now. Morning, good. Do you know why, what time in the morning, from when to when? Audience: I don&rsquo;t know exactly when, it just feels better in the morning. After six and before 11. Adano: You&rsquo;re dealing with your spleen which is very close to your adrenals and memory is always related to adrenal action and in the acupuncture principles, we have to know the timing of every organ, it&rsquo;s high tide and it&rsquo;s low tide. That means its constriction/dilation behavior and the lungs operate between three and five AM for maximum operation of oxygen. People who have lung diseases usually die in lung time from congestion of the lungs but the problem is always observed to have occurred years ago in the bladder, the direct organ opposite to the lungs. Now people who have a problem with memory since that is a spleen time close to the adrenals, usually have problems with their pericardium. Any constriction in the throat as a child would shut down the memory bank therefore the tendency to remember gets slower because of the constriction in the thyroid. Now if you now the tonsils and thyroid operate exactly between seven and nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening which is exactly opposite to the spleen which is between nine to eleven. So nine to eleven in the morning is the spleen and nine to eleven in the evening would be the thyroid and tonsils combination. In the evening time between 9 and 11, how do you feel? Audience: Usually the best I would say. It varies but I&rsquo;ve always been kind of a late person. Adano: But you feel high, more high, more alert? Audience: Right. Adano: But towards morning you don&rsquo;t feel as much. Good, that&rsquo;s because the organ being removed has shifted the frequencies now forcing the memory banks to compensate so you would do best in retaining all your data by studying between that time in the evening instead of trying to force it in the morning on the organ that is not going to be able to compensate for it. See because that area is removed in that part of the anatomy, then when you want to sit down and study data that that would be the time because then you&rsquo;ll take a full advantage of that condition and therefore you retain your information and you&rsquo;re ready for next morning. But if you try to sit down in the morning to catch up with it, you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;re not recalling as fast and you&rsquo;re slowing down too quick, that would be the problem but you have a way now to validate and help yourself to retain because the brain will synchronize. See the lung works between three and five AM and the brain is not functional without the lungs but the tonsils were removed, they are above the lungs. Now 9 to 11 PM is the tonsils time. 11 to 1 is the gallbladder time and 1 to 3 is the liver time and 3 to 5 is the lung time so you see tonsil is ahead of lung time. 5 to 7 is the large intestine time. 7 to 9 is the stomach time and 9 to 11, again opposite, is the spleen time which is closely related to where the adrenals are. So your memory will not pick up in the morning for the deficiency of the missing area in the throat. To compensate for that, you go into that very area that has been removed and work in that time zone, that&rsquo;s how the cosmic engineer figured out a long time ago to make compensation and then give it dreams to fellows like psychics and seers so we call it now cosmic healing or spiritual healing. Audience: How have these times been regulated and how have they been discovered? Adano: By sick people. (Laughter). Let me show you. There is a medicine now being recognized as very very potent for cancer and it&rsquo;s called platinum chloride. It was discovered by Dr. Horesky who has done the research in the last four years and applied it to his patients of cancer. When platinum chloride is administered before 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, every patient recovered and went home. When it was administered after 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, everyone died the next day from pneumonia. The records are on file now because this is what started the concept of chrono biology research because chrono is the time and the biological reaction to time and the chemical they were using was platinum chloride. When administered at the wrong time, this the organs did different things. When administered at a certain time, they did a different thing and they&rsquo;re finding that more and more now that when they go back to the medical records when people die versus when they live in relation to a certain disease, what organs were in relationship. And the lungs would collapse and fill up and they don&rsquo;t function properly and just get congested more and more and they die. One cannot say they died from cancer because the death recordings, they die from pneumonia in the lungs and this is on record now, they&rsquo;re doing a lot of testing on it so they have already established the record or the time lapse for each organ, the twelve major organs of the body and the periods in which these organs operate to their relationships to each other in terms of communication and feedback. So it&rsquo;s established already, lung time is from 3 am to 5 am but by the same token apart from this research, Man gets his dreams or his inspirations between that time. You read of any invention that has been discovered, they always seem to get it in the early morning like a dream flashing through their mind in the early morning between three and five and then when you check out the anatomy for the actual rhythms of the blood, the organ that is absorbing minerals in transport between three and five are minerals that are going to feed the (inaudible) of the lungs. Therefore the Yogis in the East now usually get up at nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening to meditate, right or wrong? Wrong, they get up between three and five in the morning before the sun comes up and sit in meditation, communion. This has often been known in the Yogic science as the God time, the lung time, the time when the mechanism is synchronized to function in rhythm with its health. In the turning on of this internal mechanism, we can check now various diseases of what we call hypo or hyper. Diseases that are hyper are going too fast in the organism. Diseases that are hypo are going too slow and they can be tracked right back to the breathing which regulates the respiratory flow and the distribution of the blood to the heart. Once the breathing is off and it&rsquo;s going too fast, you have a hyper condition. If it&rsquo;s going too slow, you have a hypo condition. Now high blood pressure is associated with fast breathing, it&rsquo;s not associated with slow breathing and low blood pressure is associated with slow breathing, see? So the pressure and the breathing are interrelated and it can be checked out over and over so patients that have a high pressure, what we try to do with them now is to reorganize their breathing, bringing them back and clocking them and then they clock back to the exact time, they normalize then whatever toxicity you have that is rationally taken off by nutrition and exercise. 1:40 Audience: Is there a way to develop your abilities to perceive what is wrong (inaudible) by your aura or vibe? Adano: Yes there is ways by concentration but the Kirilian camera is your validation, you can work with both. You need both in today&rsquo;s understanding that you can take a picture of the person&rsquo;s outline of the body and get the actual corona of the energy field. A healthy tissue where the minerals are being delivered by the blood on time to the organ, (inaudible). If the organ is starving you&rsquo;re going to feel a funny sensation in it and you may think you&rsquo;ve got all kinds of weird sensations and it&rsquo;s simply deficiency of transportation. So let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a deficiency towards this part of the anatomy, in the corona of the energy field it will diminish and the overload will show up. So one part of the whole corona will be wide and one will be flattened in and the rest will be uniform. Years ago we never knew how to read it, those who were able to read it began to understand it better but those who didn&rsquo;t know how to read it made a lot of mistakes and often gave the wrong information. But by the same token, if you don&rsquo;t have a camera to see, the hand is a sensor and you can pass the hands over the entire body and follow the corona and you&rsquo;ll feel where it bulges and where it dips. Also you will feel the shift in the temperature because you are a module of this whole universal principle from sonics right down to crystalline and you have a temperature ratio and a delivery time through this entire fluid system. So that when you pass your hand, the different areas of the body will have different heat or temperature so you&rsquo;ll often hear &ldquo;cold feet warm heart, cold heart hot feet.&rdquo; Yet we didn&rsquo;t realize what we were saying now, it&rsquo;s measurable and in terms of psychological behavior from a memory bank it&rsquo;s happening, the memory that will trigger that condition right there. But first again in order to pass your hand or check it, you the therapist has to learn how to breathe because if you don&rsquo;t breathe correctly, you&rsquo;ll be reading incorrectly. So the first person to work on is on yourself regulating your respiratory rate. It&rsquo;s like a car, the battery is run down, you turn it and turn it, it don&rsquo;t start up. You get a car that comes over and you flag him down and say &ldquo;hi, you want to give me a jump?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah I gotta jumper cable.&rdquo; Now if he makes the mistake of not turning on his engine to let it run and then give you a jump from his battery to your battery, you drain him off, familiar experience? Good, okay, same law applies, no different, ou see? First put yourself in order then you can relate otherwise you&rsquo;ll get drained off, that&rsquo;s no fault of the other person. Audience: If you can sense it by feeling, how do you then develop the ability to perceive in another way to change it from the feeling of it to be being it or perceiving it? I understand that there are people who can look at someone&hellip; Adano: Yes, put it this way. There are those who can see but cannot feel. They are those who can feel and cannot see. There are those who can hear and cannot see nor feel. It depends on what level of evolution you&rsquo;re in the playback of your growth you&rsquo;re in. &ldquo;Blessed is he you can see, feel, touch, and hear&rdquo; and let alone smell, that&rsquo;s what we call total memory now. Each one of those abilities have a name: psychometry, clairvoyance, and everything, they all have different labels for their abilities but the realized person has the total spectrum working for the first time in him, he has the total memory. So he not only sees but he feels and hears and smells and can taste, that&rsquo;s why you first got to put yourself in order. It&rsquo;s like a doctor, he can&rsquo;t be a doctor if you don&rsquo;t go take his training first. So equally a psychotherapist or a parapsychological therapist should first train himself in the parapsychological laws then he can go and function. To merely have the ability and try to work with it is not enough, you need to improve upon it, you need to know more about it and then you will competent with it and so you evolve through the different levels of it. Again at certain age level, the full spectrum opens up. Full spectrum awareness occurs between 30 to 35 in the first phase of a person&rsquo;s evolution. Now if he doesn&rsquo;t accomplish it within 30 to 35, the second phase of full spectrum of consciousness is 45 to 65. Now if he doesn&rsquo;t accomplish between that second phase then he&rsquo;s got one more opportunity, 80 to 100 on. That&rsquo;s why some records show individuals to have a late illumination in that awareness and others have an early illumination and the majority falls in the middle. Now depending on how old you are now and trying to shift over, it&rsquo;s like trying to say to yourself &ldquo;I just got pregnant today, I want the baby tomorrow.&rdquo; (Laughter). You personally have to go through certain psycho physiological changing and cleansing routines on your own mechanism to evaluate and let it occur. So it&rsquo;s not something that you can push, it&rsquo;s something you have to let mature within but you will get it. It&rsquo;s there for you, you know you may not know at which one of the three levels you&rsquo;re in for it to mature out so don&rsquo;t let that bother you, all you have to do is go on in and it will come out. I&rsquo;ll say this is how it happened to me. Paramahansa Yogananda was my teacher at the time in the body, I wrote to him and I said &ldquo;I would like to buy a hundred books on God.&rdquo; Realizing that the man was a fantastic spiritual teacher, I was still writing him a letter like that and saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to buy a hundred books on God.&rdquo; That shows you how uninformed I am of what God is but he writes back and says &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the books,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s how he puts it &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the books in comparison to 15 minutes silence in the Soul.&rdquo; Well to this day I can say it took me 20 years to accomplish 15 minutes silence in the Soul. When I accomplished it, I realized what he was saying that I couldn&rsquo;t push these phenomenas or these capabilities. That the maturing time, like the seed is planted in me, and this length of time would be required for it to mature into a fruit that I could use it and work with it, do you see? So you may not know where in your memory bank you left off and when is it going to come to the surface for you to have the ability to apply but if you keep going in and applying the techniques that you learn to look inside, you will eventually bring it to the surface. 1:50 Audience: Did I hear you say earlier that you had a death experience? Adano: Well I was helping a friend fix a TV antenna in Canada and it was on his mother&rsquo;s house, a three-story building in Canada. The rain had fallen in the afternoon and wet the balcony, the balconies are made of wood, and while pulling on the cable I was wearing what you would call one of those running shoes and it was smooth and while pulling on the cable I slipped, crashed into the balcony rail, and the balcony rail broke and I&rsquo;m coming 30 feet down. Well being a student of meditative life, I says &ldquo;Oh boy&rdquo; but again the brain starts to calculate so fast in terms of physics, you know the speed of acceleration is 32 feet per second per second and I&rsquo;m going to fall 30 feet, already making all these surveying measurements. The brain comes telling me during that traveling time &ldquo;If you hit the ground, you will be dead if you don&rsquo;t veer off from the concrete.&rdquo; I took my left foot and kicked the wall as I was sliding coming down, I could reach this part of the wall and veered and I landed on the solid earth that was wet from the rain, not the concrete. I went back years after my operation and healed myself, I went back to see the house and I knew how that walkway was. I was exactly six inches away from the concrete, full embodied into the earth, and the police then at the time they came because they had to call them. You know you fall down and here&rsquo;s a phenomenon of your mechanism, I fell I hit the ground yet I felt no pain. You tell someone you didn&rsquo;t feel any pain they look at you kind of funny falling 30 feet? Well I met a woman who fell 100 feet, got up and walked away, all she had was a sprained ankle but you don&rsquo;t feel any pain. In my body I felt no pain, I landed on my back but when I tried to get up, none of the parts will coordinate yet the sensation of hitting the ground is like if you&rsquo;re playing with your friend and you roll on the floor, that&rsquo;s all the sensation. And yet when I try to put pressure on the ankle to lift the entire body, put the pressure on the wrist or the elbow, there is no coordination and I can&rsquo;t move. Then my friend comes down and I says to him &ldquo;I think I must have something gone wrong in my mechanism.&rdquo; He was a lawyer, he said the quickest way for them to get any help is to call the police, don&rsquo;t call anybody else, just call the police and they&rsquo;ll get an ambulance. So he called the Mounted Police and the ambulance is coming. In the meantime my body is getting numb, cold numb from the toe up, this is how I discovered we never die from the head down, we die from our feet up and years after I validated the research, we die from our feet up. Nature has made all these wonderful precautions and stored them in a memory bank. All right I&rsquo;m shutting down aggressively from the foot up and the body becoming numb, just like somebody gave you a novocaine you know and it&rsquo;s a slow gradually shutting down. Yet the brain is still functioning and saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let the numbness pass your eyes otherwise you&rsquo;ll be dead.&rdquo; Well what do you do to stop numbness? There again memory comes back, picture your brain you have to say &ldquo;what do I do, what do I do?&rdquo; And then here comes the picture flashing through my brain, a cowboy falls off a horse and he&rsquo;s shot in the body, that&rsquo;s a picture that I&rsquo;m seeing and how is he going to help this cowboy by giving him something to bite so he can take the bullet out and it&rsquo;s like seeing an old cowboy movie and the knife is being heated up and this cowboy is biting on a bullet. Well that comes to my mind, &ldquo;bite,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the message &ldquo;bite.&rdquo; So I reached around for my hands, they&rsquo;re numb, but knowing my anatomy this is the ascending side and this is the descending side, don&rsquo;t bite the descending side because you&rsquo;ll shut it off, bite the ascending side of the body. So I put the&hellip; and start biting down on the right thumb which is a direct signal to the lung meridian to the brain. Instantly the numbness stopped right at this point, the tip of the nose. It began to recede, the harder I bite&hellip; when I started to bite I felt no sensation but when I felt the first sensation then it stopped and then I bite harder and harder. In fact sometimes you don&rsquo;t even know how hard you&rsquo;re biting until after you look and examine it, how much power you exerted and pressure of the bite to leave a mark on the finger and it receded all the way down and stopped here, it never went any further than the heart, would not go below the rib cage, it stopped right here. I&rsquo;m conscious, fully conscious, no sensation of pain but totally anesthetized like a tooth in your mouth from a dentist. That&rsquo;s my switch, if I pull away the finger it starts coming back again up so you&rsquo;re lying in a precarious position. In the meantime what is going on in my head, when I hit the ground I went out of my body, I had out of body experiences but not in this manner where you&rsquo;re thrown out and you&rsquo;re looking at yourself lying down and you&rsquo;re looking yourself outside and then all around you are your favorite friends of the highest order to the lowest order looking at you. You say &ldquo;Are you dead?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I in hell?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you in heaven?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are here.&rdquo; But funny enough those of a high caliber of consciousness that you may relate to, it&rsquo;s easier for you to feel them. And those of a lower consciousness that you might have known, it&rsquo;s harder to feel them. There seems to be an insulation between you and them in the memory banks and the closer you look to those&hellip; I saw all the great Masters but they were so fluidic and then I saw myself in all of them, then I realized that the Creative Intelligence became me. It&rsquo;s at that time I realized that experience but then I also saw in the same tunnel of experience the decisive moment of dying and leaving this present body or the option. Then you realize there&rsquo;s only one time in your life that you have an option, no other time in your life you might ever have an option, is at death. The option is at death, not at birth because that prepares you for the next birth. The option at death prepares you for the next birth. I saw the body of a woman in Africa about to have a baby, it&rsquo;s gonna be a boy, his destiny was to become a businessman and run his father&rsquo;s business and study in America, that&rsquo;s the destiny of it, that was waiting. The option is my broken body and a whole series of faces waiting with hands like that, like the tail of a kite and they&rsquo;re all on the end of the tail like that, and that&rsquo;s the option with the broken body and the pain. Now if I phase out, the cord that connects the body to the Soul nature will shut off like an umbilical cord and I will be born into the invisible, that would be my birthday into the invisible, you call it death. They will put away my mechanism or cremate it but that would be my birthday to the invisible. I went to the invisible mechanism of the body waiting for me to merge and come out and live out that karma or take up by volunteering this broken mechanism with all these faces attached to it as an unfinished residual obligation to work with it. Well judging from the faces of all the realized Ones and even Jesus, how are you going to answer a thing like that? They don&rsquo;t talk with their mouths, they talk with their eyes, and it has nothing to do with intellect, it has do with your heart, they penetrate your heart so deeply with Their eyes that what is it all about? The universe is for love but not to be in love with it because the moment you say you&rsquo;re in love with it, your program out of love and you&rsquo;re gonna fall out. You&rsquo;ll have incidences to go in and out of it but if you say &ldquo;love&rdquo; and you feel it, this is what they call the compassionate nature starts to emerge out of your memory bank. Creative Life is Creative Love already locked up in you and all the loved ones that have gone ahead, they so loved the world that they enter into it. 2:00 And if you read a statement they say &ldquo;God so loved the world He gave his only begotten son&rdquo; meaning that consciousness out of creativeness loves Its manifestation that It will constantly merge Itself into Its manifestation for the benefit of Its manifestation. So you begin to realize what a fantastic process of God&rsquo;s love is embodied (inaudible), coming in, you can&rsquo;t evade it no more, it&rsquo;s not a mind thing no more, it&rsquo;s not a brain, it&rsquo;s heart. The heart begins to pulsate for the first time. Well I could feel the beat, then I said &ldquo;Okay, I accept my body&rdquo; and I found myself slipping back into the body, no pain. By that time the ambulance arrived and they&rsquo;re already coming up and they got me in the ambulance and the comedy of it is that the siren can kill you more than anything else, the drone on that siren to get people out of the way could kill you because at that level your sense of hearing transcends every other sensory function you have. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw Superman 3, the little boy says &ldquo;I love you, I love you.&rdquo; The sense of hearing got through to Superman to make him fight off his delusions about himself, the pictures are catching up with the truth. The sense of hearing is the connected link all the time. I can hear these people talking but I&rsquo;m paying no attention to them, I&rsquo;m trying to get my mind centered from the siren and the siren is drowning them out. We arrive at the hospital and they&rsquo;re hauling me out of the stretcher and another comes out, this beautiful nurse all starched up with a big pad, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, what do you do?&rdquo; She was trying to get all this data from me and intern looks and says &ldquo;Nurse, this man is dying. He doesn&rsquo;t have time to answer questions.&rdquo; Now here again Creative Intelligence is organizing your life. I&rsquo;m meeting with people but faces were glimmers in the experience of falling and the timing is so intricate that every second, every happening, every individual is synchronizing with the timing. I have to sit back now and watch and not interfere because I&rsquo;m taking notation of this process. I&rsquo;m in the emergency room, I hear the elevator open up and comes down, out steps an elderly gentleman and he is a doctor and he is looking at these men working and then he said to one of the interns &ldquo;this man is dying&rdquo; and he took away the instrument and stuck it under the ribs to deflate the lungs. I looked up, but you don&rsquo;t feel anything because you&rsquo;re so numb already and he said &ldquo;young man normally I don&rsquo;t come down this elevator but tonight the other one didn&rsquo;t work and I was forced to come down this one.&rdquo; Now in his mind that&rsquo;s his conviction, in my mind synchronous timing on the memory bank of the blueprint pulling the pieces together in the jigsaw puzzle but you have to let it happen. And he says &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, everything will be all right&rdquo; and the face changes and it&rsquo;s the superimposition of all the great Saints are passing through. He may not see it but I&rsquo;m there looking at this kaleidoscope of how this thing&hellip; Who is talking or who is sensing what he&rsquo;s saying? He may in his logical mind say (inaudible) but again something deep inwardly is interacting for the consolation for me to relate to. That memory bank is assuring me that this is part of the process I&rsquo;m going through so my logical mind must take temporary suspension and let the intuitive mind flow. Then my memory banks began to open up more, I never knew there where so many memory banks to open because faces that began to come in the room become like if I knew them before, they just start flipping up and I can see into the various objects, it was just starting to flow back. Then he said to me &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;thank you doctor&rdquo; and he walked away. I owned a business at that time and several people depended on me and I had to open to place the next morning at around seven o&rsquo;clock to let them go to work. So you can imagine my mental quandary realizing I&rsquo;m in a hospital and then they gave me an injection to put me to sleep, telling me that I&rsquo;m going to be all right, and this is Wednesday night at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I had to open up at 7 o&rsquo;clock on a Thursday. The quandary of my mind is in various ways, how it shuts off and tried to interject but then I said &ldquo;No, he said that it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay. Live the words.&rdquo; This is how the consciousness comes into me. So I began to picture a clock in front of me and as I said to the man last night &ldquo;always set up your programs for coming back, otherwise you lock yourself out into the non-verbal level and you can&rsquo;t return.&rdquo; So I started the clock, in the room all the people are working but I&rsquo;m looking at this big clock and designing it and there&rsquo;s the long arm pointing at 12 and a short arm pointing at 7 and I&rsquo;m looking at it mentally, visualizing it, and I&rsquo;m trying to merge my whole entire (inaudible) and let go now of holding back any sensation and go into the unconscious. I&rsquo;m gone, believing in that state I&rsquo;m sound asleep, enjoying a wonderful night&rsquo;s rest, waking up tomorrow morning to go run my business, see how illusions can be great, how desires can be fantastic? In my brain all of a sudden &ldquo;ring ring ring ring, seven o&rsquo;clock, ring ring ring ring, seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; You ever set an alarm clock to go to the airport, you even get up before it rings? The phenomena of memory, the phenomenon of the will to integrate with it and the timing. I open my eyes and then I&rsquo;m hearing all of a sudden on the left hand side, &ldquo;Well if he don&rsquo;t die now, he ain&rsquo;t gonna die.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Who the hell is dying?&rdquo; When I did realize what had happened, where I was, I was strapped up like a chicken on a spit with all kind of equipment running through me and here I am like this. And I look and I see my friend sitting there, the lawyer, and all the doctors were standing in the corner making the comment that I was going to die. And I said &ldquo;Hey man, isn&rsquo;t this Thursday morning seven o&rsquo;clock? What are you doing in my house?&rdquo; Do you see how your brain works? He says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the hospital and it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock Saturday afternoon.&rdquo; And to me all I could remember is that I went to sleep and got up at 7 o&rsquo;clock Thursday morning and he&rsquo;s validating that it&rsquo;s not seven o&rsquo;clock Thursday morning and you&rsquo;re not in your house, you&rsquo;re in the hospital strung out and it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock saturday afternoon. Well I&rsquo;m gathering my senses again and I&rsquo;m starting to feel woosy again and I said &ldquo;Okay, thank you.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow morning, ten o&rsquo;clock okay? I&rsquo;m going to go to bed.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll take care of the business for you.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sound asleep and ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning is the real pincher of my experience now. I can hear inside my consciousness &ldquo;wake up, wake up&rdquo; and I open my eyes and there&rsquo;s the doctor standing there. I see he&rsquo;s getting ready an injection needle and I said, &ldquo;Doc, what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Well young man, you had a very very serious accident and you don&rsquo;t realize it. I&rsquo;m just going to give you a brief rundown of your problem.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; 2:10 He says &ldquo;You fell off a building. According to the report from the police, it was 30 feet and according to all the X-rays you have 50 compound fractures which is a total of 94 breaks, that&rsquo;s number two. Number three, you&rsquo;re coming out of a deep comatic stage where your whole body is going to be racked in pain and you&rsquo;re going to need some sedation every hour on the hour to get you through the pain.&rdquo; And I looked at him and says, &ldquo;No doc, I don&rsquo;t want no drugs with my body.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m banking on memory banks of martial art training, banking on Yoga training, and all the different previous physical training to go tell a doctor his knowledge that I don&rsquo;t want the drug in my body. He says &ldquo;Mr. Ley you don&rsquo;t understand your predicament.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;No doctor, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Okay, we don&rsquo;t force but nurse if ever this man cries out that he wants it, administer it. If he doesn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Now here&rsquo;s the comment, he walks away and she looks at me and she says, &ldquo;You doggone Orientals, you think you&rsquo;re tough, eh?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that nurse, I just don&rsquo;t want drugs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait and see buddy&rdquo; and she walked off. Well it didn&rsquo;t take too long, the pain starts to unreel itself. It&rsquo;s like a tape now, the tape recorder now, where&rsquo;s the pain really coming from? Is it the pain so much from the break, that could be valid. Or is it pain from a memory bank that I might have hurt someone in previous lives and trying to reconcile, now I&rsquo;m paying the bill, it&rsquo;s been dumped on me. So the pain is coming up and I said &ldquo;How do you fight pain?&rdquo; Again the image comes back, bite something. Remember when I said I bit on my hand? Well I&rsquo;m strapped up and you can&rsquo;t bite much now, all you got is the pillow and I&rsquo;m biting (Adano makes biting sounds). My face is starting to perspire, I&rsquo;m getting red and the nurse comes along and says &ldquo;Mr. Ley&hellip;&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m battling with her and she&rsquo;s still upset and I&rsquo;m battling with this. Well this goes on for a long while, I&rsquo;m perspiring and she has to come and change the sheets and I&rsquo;m groaning and grunting but I&rsquo;m not giving in and they say &ldquo;you got to go through it.&rdquo; I said to myself &ldquo;If the Creative Intelligence does exist and He puts me here and I can&rsquo;t go through it, then I give up. But if He does exist and I&rsquo;ve had enough evidence that He&rsquo;s existing already and I selected, I volunteered for the frame, I could have been in the mother&rsquo;s tummy right now but here in this frame I volunteered to go through it so shut up. Let the pain work itself out.&rdquo; Your own endorphins come to your rescue but not before. These fellas are very smart, they&rsquo;re like what you call the Spanish inquisitors, they wait to see how long you&rsquo;ll put up with it then they&rsquo;ll give you a relief. Well I fought and fought and eventually the room started to darken and the walls narrowed out and I saw a figure coming on, I thought it was a nun walking towards me but it turned out to be an image of the person like the Virgin Mother that I used to see in the Catholic churches. But when the the person came right up to the bed, the eyes were closed and in that posture, what you call the pronam posture and this really means &ldquo;the God in me bows to the God in you.&rdquo; But the eyes are closed and I&rsquo;m saying in my mind &ldquo;Please open your eyes&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m biting. Eventually the eyes open because that&rsquo;s how they communicate, they don&rsquo;t communicate with their mouth on that level, it&rsquo;s always eye to eye, eyes are the windows of the Soul, eyes are the communicating. And it sends the message that signals into your mechanism and it&rsquo;s like somebody turning on your own memory bank and letting it play, the eye hits your eye, it&rsquo;s fixed the frame in the back of the head like how you fix your tape here to replay and zing, it&rsquo;s playing inside and you&rsquo;re getting the message and the message is simply this, &ldquo;You will be well but not dramatically.&rdquo; The moment that was said I can feel the pain shifting down from my forehead but at the same time, the image of the person is diminishing. As they gradually diminish, the pain is diminishing. When it passed my mouth and it went to the foot and the image is already gone and the pain is already&hellip; I let out a yell &ldquo;I am well.&rdquo; This is four hours after and the nurse and everybody comes running &ldquo;Oh this crazy guy again. You must be busted up&rdquo; and then they look at me. &ldquo;I am well doctor, I&rsquo;m well.&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t believe his eyes. They take a measurement, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belive it.&rdquo; Organically, functionally, everything is back on timing except the bones. If the bones went back and locked in to their normal point of reference and fused, that would be the dramatics, I could have walked off the bed right there. So that karma I had to work through for a very good reason, it would allow me to learn what is the rational therapies and the rational memory relationships and the rational logistics of today&rsquo;s thinking by lying in that bed for almost a year and a half in a cast, getting the knowledge of how body, mind, and spirit relates. So I was getting my basic education in one of the hardest possible ways but there was no pain in the body no more from that time but the bones healed up eventually and I was able to leave. Audience: We want to thank Dr. Adano Ley very much for giving us a most insightful and provocative and inspiring presentation this morning and I thank you all for your presence and your questions and there are some refreshments now so please let us have some refreshments and you can visit with Dr. Adano Ley. (General conversation then gap in tape). Adano: &hellip;over the centuries and where you are so we need to be able to establish it. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. There is a great teacher who goes around in this country, he&rsquo;s still alive and when we met at that time I was in Tyler. He walked through the door, he and his wife, and he looked at me and he said, &ldquo;Hello brother of 150,000 lives.&rdquo; He counted the actual amount of incarnations he knew me and that&rsquo;s how far his memory was able to track back. He met many other people but they were all saying the same thing, we don&rsquo;t meet because of some commitment, we meet because of a communion to put ourselves back into the stream of the unity of life. That&rsquo;s why in the church it&rsquo;s called Holy Communion, it&rsquo;s not a holy commitment. Audience: I believe in the communion of the Saints. Adano: &ldquo;I believe in the communion of the Saints.&rdquo; Right. Audience: So what did Master Yogananda mean when he said that 25% was taken by the Master and 50% grace and the other 25% by the student, the devotee? I read that in Swami Kriyananda&rsquo;s book and I don&rsquo;t quite comprehend it. 2:20 Adano: God is a total memory bank and whatever you do is stored up there waiting to be presented as a bill. That will bankrupt you in any incarnation if the bill is presented. Even before you got out of the womb, the bill would bankrupt you, you follow? So only 50% of the bill is presented to you in each incarnations, you follow so far? Ok. The other 50% of that bill would be very very traumatic if no one would vouch for you. So if you have a credit rating and you have a master charge, that allows you to hold credit, you&rsquo;ve got a 25% credit rating. So that individual is a sort of a voucher but you still got to work out the load and you&rsquo;re only going to work out 25% of the load because the mechanism cannot take the full 100% let alone the full 50%, it can only handle 25 percent. Last night when we were discussing the avenues of meditation I said there are three: one the mantra that we repeat, two the breathing, and three a contact with some human being who may intimate or be in your presence for that moment and remind you of yourself and that meditation is road in. That&rsquo;s the 25%, that&rsquo;s the master charge, that&rsquo;s the credit card, somebody gave you the credit card now go ahead use it but it allows you time to pay your bills. Otherwise the bill is every second. You see because you&rsquo;re dealing with energy and energy must be compensated in terms of momentum so if you&rsquo;re thrown out into a body form to live out unfinished memory banks and have to pay off moment-to-moment, you don&rsquo;t have a chance to live, right? You see they&rsquo;re piling up too fast. So it&rsquo;s what you call &ldquo;toned down&rdquo; to a 25% ratio allowing you 75% to catch up. So it&rsquo;s like you owe the bill and they say &ldquo;All right, you pay next month.&rdquo; So you work this whole month to catch up to pay the bill but you couldn&rsquo;t get that credit rating unless somebody vouched for it or you had some good credit rating built up already and that&rsquo;s basically what that point of reference is in meditation. You may have done a lot of mantra, that&rsquo;s storing it up as an accruable bank account. You might have done a lot of breathing that&rsquo;s an accruable bank account and periodically you might have met some person who could vouch that you&rsquo;re a good guy or say you&rsquo;re a doggone scum. Whoever that person that could vouch for you will have some credit rating in your references so you come back having to work it out. So sometimes when you meet people through your life, whoever you feel a compassionate urge for (inaudible) to forgive them for being harsh to you, that&rsquo;s a sort of credit rating building up in your favor. Anytime you can be flexible enough to be a little compassionate than to be belligerent right away because somebody hurt you, you&rsquo;re building up the credit rating for a human contact now who carries a greater credit rating from having realized themselves to some extent and then coming into your time focus as a communion to validate &ldquo;Well hi, carry on, you&rsquo;re credit rating is okay.&rdquo; Audience: Is there such a thing as a memory bank of mankind. You were talking about research and advances in research and technology, versus an individual memory bank? Adano: Yes, no, maybe. I give you an example so you can understand it. Have you ever seen a gas jet on a stove with individual holes and they have a tube where the gas comes in but before they get to the holes there&rsquo;s a little gadget with a light burning? If that&rsquo;s not there, what would happen to the gas? Collectively, the collective memory bank is the gas going through to the jets but the light, the pilot light, is the monitoring incidences when they should come due. So when you turn the switch on the burner, the gas will come up and you have to light it and you have to make sure that they all lit otherwise the room will fill with gas. But each one of those holes will act as an independent function yet they&rsquo;re all feeding off the one gas. Individual memory is like that, passing through us at the respiratory rate set up in the organism. The collective memory put us together as an organism. So now the light that is in us is the pilot light and that&rsquo;s what they refer to as the Christ in you or your intuitive nature, your self-internal directing nature. When you turn into it or Krishna consciousness is the same thing, when you turn to it you light up your individuality. You light the pilot light and then you turn the handle then all the other parts of the burner will get gas and they&rsquo;ll light up from that. So different parts of your individuality or individualistic memories will come up for you to reconcile but there is one grand pool where all of them fall back in but they come up to fit different incidences or requirements but you the person who is doing it may not realize that until you fall back into the (inaudible then general conversation).</p>

<p>Adano86_03_28_3LivingtoLiveQ2NW3 - 0:13 All around us, we think we are seeing living people, but really, 99% of the time, people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they are 60 years of age and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically, but if they are living to live, they have this tremendous power available to them to be in the world yet not of the whirl, to be seen and not to be seen. 0:40 The most important thing in this journey of now, since it is not going anyplace, it’s called the Journey of Now. NOW. And it sounds like a journey which implies going someplace, but you’re not going anyplace. It’s a journey of coping, more than going. It’s a big difference between looking at it as a journey of going someplace, from one place to another place. It’s occurring in Now. A journey of coping in the Now and since Now and coping are all contained by the Creative Me, that’s why Moses had to confront it, “there is no god before Me,” and don’t have no graven image. Don’t look for any object outside of yourself that’s going to represent me. Me is already locked up here. 0:51 I’ll give you an example of an illusion and the actual truth. There was a priest who lived in a town and a big rain came and it started to flood the area. So the priest began to pray to God to stop the rain. Got out there, praying, and the water came up to his knee and all the parishishioners in the town saw him there praying and they came along with the boat and said, “Father, please save yourself. Come on, get in this boat and let’s go to the highland for refuge.” And he says, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go save anyone you find that needs help, take them to safety.” He kept on praying and the water got up to his chest. By that time a second boat came along and the people said, “Oh Father, please save yourself.” He said, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go and find people that you can save and take them to the higher ground.” They went off. By that time the water got as high as his nose now. Along came a helicopter with a ladder and said, “Hey Father, please save yourself, grab the ladder, the place is all flooded.” And he shouted, “No, no, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go ahead and try and save anyone that you can take them to higher ground. I am praying to God to stop the rain.” Finally, the water is over his head and he is standing before God and he says, “How come I’m here? I thought you would stop the rain?” And God said, “Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more do you want?” You see what belief can do in that fixated state versus when the practical is all around you for you to function. And that’s the problem is happening to many of us today, that we get so over fixated in the belief and when the practical thing is there, we miss the truth. Not that a miracle cannot happen to pray for the rain to stop, with God anything is possible, but I don’t think God is constantly manufacturing miracles because somebody get down on his knees and prays for it. When all the other varieties of ways for man’s survival and continuance is available to him. He’s just got to open his consciousness and recognize the many other opportunities that are there for his survival. This is what we are calling “Living to Live” instead of living to die. Living to die is a fixated state. Living to live is not. All the great men who have come down throughout the centuries all came to teach us to live to live. FROM MARJORIE MORGAN NOTES: Yes it is very auspicious tonight the whole week has been so miraculous, so unusual, (Easter week). On the way down here I was looking for a present for my associate in Texas, trying to get a birthday present for the person. I coudn&rsquo;t decide what to buy the person. We stopped at different places and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re coming along outside Gila Bend, I said to my friend who was driving, &ldquo;stop the van, stop right here, your going to get gas.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;no, the gas station if further down.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;no, the gas station is right here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop, stop,,&rdquo; and he pulled over to the side of the road and there is the gas station. I don&rsquo;t know if you know the place. It is called Cosmo Gas Station and Cosmo Restaurant. It&rsquo;s right on the way to Tucson. We go into the place to buy gas, and the owner had a little store on the side. I saw the present. It was a brass crucifix and I picked it up and somehow it didn&rsquo;t ring a bell completely. It was ideal yet it didn&rsquo;t fit; and I said &ldquo;well tomorrow is the crucifiction (Good Friday,) there is something wrong. I turned around and on the shelf behind me is a little dish-plate with the last supper painted into it. I said &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and when I reached for it I could feel the vibration , and the price was so appropiate. The owner started to laugh. We were getting something so beautiful for almost peanuts. But the person whom the present was for would appreciate having it and discovering it on a day like yesterday. That was so amazing about it. Now tonight we are discussing one of the most unusual moments in life-on Good Friday-that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about. Is it realy the crucifixon or the sorrow of death? Or is it something that leads to the triumph of what are we all living here for? Society is geared to live to die and it&rsquo;s not an ideal process. It&rsquo;s creating sickness. But you&rsquo;re got to live a certain amount of years to prepare to retire, to phase off, and be placed in the soil ,and to look for some nebulous region in the heavens, and you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually there. Then you can go along through life with tremondous conviction-it&rsquo;s there. But the real test is when you lay down and die. And then here we celebrate and remember a life that is lived on the planet and that is gone. Yet the challenge is not today. The challenge is the day after tomorrow. What happens? The triumph of death. But it&rsquo;s not so much the triumph of death&ndash; that is what you are looking for; what we are looking for is how to live to live and not live to die. All through the centuries man has lived to die and took out his vengence on his fellow man in order to eliminate it so you won&rsquo;t have to face it. And then here comes along an incident where the man Jesus raised another person from the grave showing that living to die isn&rsquo;t really the goal of life. Why raise another dead man from the grave if living to die, to find God is the true purpose? But living to live, to encounter God, is now in your immediate life, is the real challenge and the real experience. Yogananda use to say everything else can wait but the search for God cannot because it&rsquo;s a conscious now experience, not something nebulous and far beyond time. If you can&rsquo;t encounter it now in the waking state and really have the understanding and assurance of how it relates, you don&rsquo;t have anything. If you&rsquo;re all lying down dead in this room and God walks in and says &ldquo;Hi folks. What do you want,; your breath back, the power to perform miracles, or some possessions to make you the wealthiest people in the world?&rdquo; What would you choose? You sure would want your breath back! It doesn&rsquo;t look like much. It doesn&quot;t sound like much-right-compared to performing miracles and having possessions, yet you cannot perform miracles if you don&rsquo;t breathe. And you can&rsquo;t own anything if you don&rsquo;t breathe either. Is it in death or is it in life? When you understand where the real encounter is then you understand why Jesus said &ldquo;My God is a God of the living, not of the dead.&rdquo; Meaning, living to die has no assurance but it&rsquo;s the ideal way to function. But living to live is ideal. It&rsquo;s ideal because it guarentees it&rsquo;s ownself, it assures it&rsquo;s ownself. The ressurection is an indication of a guarantee. But more than that the principal is in nature. The butterfly is a model of it. The butterfly came before man because his enviroment was created for him to live in. Man-if you make man before you make his enviroment where would you put him? But you have to make the enviroment first in order to function in it as a man, male and female. But then you can&rsquo;t have someone in the sky constantly directing you. It won&rsquo;t make any sense. You have to place the laws of nature around you to allow you to discover by trial and error. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so beautiful about it; that each one of us is carrying his own cross and not the other person&rsquo;s cross. &ldquo;Pick up your cross and follow me.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t pick up mine. He picked up His today. Each one of us is carrying his own particular confrontation with life, not living to die in the confrontation,but living to live in the now, each one of us. Wherever you are, whatever your doing, that&rsquo;s the moment of confrontation. And it&rsquo;s the moment of living to live. So by leaving a butterfly as a model - the butterfly is a caterpillar - a worm - eats his way through life, spins a cocoon which you call a shroud, and emerges a different creature. Of all the creatures that can fly there&rsquo;s none more beautiful than a butterfly. And I have delibrately squashed up caterpillars and checked them to see how they rot, and squashed up butterflies, and compared them. And I&rsquo; never found a rotten butterfly but I&rsquo;v found rotten caterpillars, telling me without doubt that life is for living and not to run from it. And it&rsquo;s in that process when I look at the caterpillar I realized its tissue and I looked at my own body and its tissue. I am made of the same model. But I have one advantage over that caterpiller. I can muck-up my opportunity with my mouth; but he doesn&rsquo;t have to, he eats his way and becomes a butterfly. But I can make all kinds of mistakes with my words. Whatever I say to myself I get sick or I get healthy. The caterpillar doesn&rsquo;t do that to itself so thats my disadvantage and my advantage, how to regulate my spoken word to warrant the result of the process which is eternal body or nondecomposing bodies; or take it with you and you pass on into another realm. Now its not in the imagination. It&rsquo;s a natural face. We are already designed for it but our spoken word prevents us from experiencing it. When you say we are living to live we can leave the body as a testimony of a nondecomposing organism. That would defy the thinking individual. Or you can leave then an empty coffin and wonder where we went like Brother Jesus did. He left us an empty hole in the wall. And he&rsquo;s gone, but is He invisible or has He gone? That is the question. He hasn&rsquo;t gone. But He is visible and indivisible at command per- formances; meaning, He is here with us. We have to make the attempt to want to see the living in the living and not the living in the dead. All around us we think we are seeing living people. But really 99% of the time people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they reach 60 years of age, and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically. They are just occupying space chemically. But if they are living to live they have this tremendous power available to them - to be in the world and not of the world. To be seen and not to be seen. Now is may seem far- feched but it&rsquo;s not. There is a book called &ldquo;The Incorruptables.&rdquo; There are over 300 case histories. I&rsquo;ll put it this way: one case history for each day of the month or the year. And 80% of the case histories are women of non-decomposing bodies on record. So you see it has nothing to do because who lives to die most of the time in all modern society? Did you ever hear a woman say she&rsquo;s living to retire? We always hear the best is what? He&rsquo;s working hard to retire - right? All a woman says is that she is tying to hang in there. We have to change our programing. We had better had because it&rsquo;s not practical and it&rsquo;s producing more sickness. Resurrection is not a far-fetched process. Every religion has its evidence,. But more so, people who don&rsquo;t belong to no religion, who mainly realize by virtue of trial and error, by the process of being practical moment to moment, are arriving in that state. Churchianity has nothing to do with the realization of God. Realization of God is a personal interaction of life. You are the living temple of God. You are the living church. It&rsquo;s not some building like this that you go to on a Sunday. If God were to rest what would happen to us? We&rsquo;d be in a bad place. He can&rsquo;t turn off this equiptment called the universe. He has to be everywhere. So he is his own devil! By playing His own devil he tests His own creation. But we never ask about it that way. Once we begin to realize and live in it we begin to realize that God is and always will be. Not a person sitting on a throne. A principal that has become the universe locked up in man to talk back to himself. That&rsquo;s the funny part of it. Of all the creatures in the world to worship God, they know in the 80&rsquo;s. Man endowed with individuality to talk to himself. See, He has to convince Himself and that&rsquo;s the uniqueness of it. By becomming His creation and taking the roll of man which is flesh and setting up individuality in order to give it a sense of uniqueness. The individuality is the process of which the creator talks back to Himself. Now, when you are awake and you are looking at me right now you have individuality and you feel diff- erent. You may accept what I say or reject it because you&rsquo;re awake and you are hearing me talking to you in English and you&rsquo;re using your memory training because you are programed to English; therfore you comprehend what I am saying. I look Oriental so if I spoke to you: you would not understand what the hell I was saying to you, (laughter,) right? So there you go. What the hell is that guy talking about? You see, our words suddenly lose their sense of value, and their individuality has a problem. Now all of us go to sleep at night. When you are sound asleep do you know if you are a man or a woman, no matter if you spoke Chinese, English or French? You see? But God, He isn&rsquo;t going any place. He is still holding us together, allowing us to breathe; and if you don&rsquo;t wake up, it&rsquo;s over. That&rsquo;s facts that you have got to live with every day. From the dawn of creation when we knew the universe began, to when it ends - midnight eternity. That&rsquo;s a long time. So He is not going out of business, but he is providing a unique process by which His indiv- idualized manifestations can be permanent, and not resolve itself into a unified field. He wants us to be permanent by giving us individuality, by allowing us to experience trial and error to discover living to die or living to live. And living to live is &ldquo;To he who overcometh I will not send forth a second time but will make him a pillar in the house of the Lord&rdquo;, incorruptable. Or the option of that is to appear and disappear at will, still not corruptable. See what I mean? Look what you got when you begin to realize it. Your best friend, (Adano kisses His own hand here,) self love, not nartistic, cosmic. No greater love than he who would lay down his cells for his fellow man, but greater love is he who can recognize the God in himself. That&rsquo;s the greater love because I can&rsquo;t love you like myself. I can only love you as myself. There is a vast difference. See. &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of thy mind not part of the mind. So you can&rsquo;t sleep you know,. You can&rsquo;t die, that&rsquo;s the end of the mind, but that&rsquo;s no all. If you&rsquo;re going to love Him you&rsquo;re going to do what? Be alive, awake, alert and enthusiastic, and,with all your heart. It&rsquo;s got to be counted conscious now, all your strength. The respitory rate has got to be envolved, and soul. That&rsquo;s your individuality. You are soul. If you have soul it&rsquo;s preposterous to ask the body to save it. But because you&rsquo;re an individ ualist in the creative process, you can use your individualism to exhalt your reality and bring out the soul- ness of it which is God in you. Make it a permanent principal. If you have soul it is preposterous to ask the body to save it, but because you are an individualist in the creative process you can use your indiv- idualism to exhault your reality and bring out the soulness of it which is God in you. Make it a perman- ent principal. &quot; To him that overcometh&rdquo; - overcometh this flux - you won&rsquo;t have to do it a second time. We may be at a hundred million second time right now waiting to make the transition , but in making a pillar a pillar is a structure of something that doesn&rsquo;t change in the house of the Lord, in this whole crea- tive process. So the only way we could become permanent would be like the butterfly emerging out of the caterpillar - the incorruptable. As we achieve this incorruptable state we have the individualism still locked up in us to go back and forth in the universe being visible and invisible on command performance. For that reason early man created his communication by saying &ldquo;I believe in the communion with the saints.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a vast difference to say I believe in the communion with spirits. The saint was once a living human being who went through the transition of going from the visible to thje invisible, and from breakdown to nonbreakdown. Therefor he has no hangups and he has no games to play. He&rsquo;s not here to take advantage of you or try to get you into God. He is here to remind you that you have God in you. The psysic may not. Ge can be carried away. He is the moth that flies to the light and gets burned up. The butterfly is different. It doesn&rsquo;t fly to the light to get burned uyp. It emerges out of the caterpillar by the process of , gradual anguish, of eating it&rsquo;s way and comes out a beautiful creature that can fly. Tkhat&rsquo;s the transition of the true person. That is the path that the great man Jesus come to show. His life is that model in hhaman form taken from the cosmic law laid up in the caterpillar to the butterfly. All the great souls that demonstrate this are his brothers and sisters because the Christ principal is locked up in you already. That is why he said in simple language &quot; the things I do you can do also, but not greater than me&rdquo; - right or wrong? I know it is wrong because if he said that , then I say &ldquo;right brotherJesus, you are the only one and true son of God. I&rsquo;d throw myself down here because you are number one and will always be number one. But he never said that. He said &ldquo;the things I do you can do and greater things shall you do. &quot; It means the option to be free is locked up in you, if you grasp it and apply it. Because he grasped it within himself and applied it, he grasped the greater quality, the greater power locked up in himself. Now we have to grasp it. When it is put into simple language it simply means we have to grasp the desire to live to live and not live to die. Living to die is not the Christ state. The Christ state that will offer you death and it dies in itself cannot be a Christ state. It has to offer you life and remain as a living principal in itself. If God is life and God is in everything and endowers you and I with individuality to experience to see if you are willing to take a chance with your individuality at the conscious level. Unconsciously when you are sound asleep you won&rsquo;t know. That happens to you from the time you are born, your conscious,and you, must go through your life-part of it- unconscious; and you may go through your whole life with that portion of unconscious, never happening, never finding out what realy occurs, what realy happens in that period of your life. Who are you? What are you doing there? What am I believing or what am I actually trying to experience? A vast difference -what I believe versus what I actually am-are two different things-like night and day. I can believe in a lot of things; but it can turn out I may be wrong. Then I&rsquo;m destroyed with my delusion. What I actually am is not going to fool me because that is exactaly what I&rsquo;ll always be. Now I am atomic energy ! I&rsquo;m not going any place! Ancient man called it spirit. Modern man calls it cosmic force. Whatever you want to call it, it&rsquo;s not going any place. It is. Like it or not. When Jesus said &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father,&rdquo; you see this body, you see the cosmic principal. &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; This individuality and this principal are one in the same thing. We arn&rsquo;t going any place. You are stuck with it. Two things equal to the same thing are equal to what? Newton&rsquo;s law-one another. You and I -yes-are one in the same; but at different levels os expression called individuality. The realization is your moment to moment encounter. I&rsquo;m not here to mold you into anything, Iam here to find who I am. You are here to find out who you are. But we could be locked into a long time arguement as to how you will mold each other, and hate each other; and yet when we fall asleep at night all the molding is over (laugh,) and all the hatred is over and if we never wake up what did we learn? Nothing, because we are back right where we started to find out what we are when we are sound asleep. You see, thats why Paul quit trying to go around converting people. Do you know why he quit? It was when he realized he coudn&rsquo;t control his internal life. He said, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing.&rdquo; Meaning: You can go around rejoicing in your converting these Jewish people to become Christians. I quit because I live and die daily in the Lord right now. I don&rsquo;t know of any other process that I have found out that this is where it is at - not trying to con- vert. You can&rsquo;t make a rose into a daisy. A rose is a rose and a daisy is a daisy. Both have to get inside. I have to intergrade too. At the process of breathing we come into this world and we cut the cord. If we breathe on time they keep us. If we don&rsquo;t breathe on time they bury us. Then we start all over again. You are lucky if you think of it: you made thiry years, forty years, sixty years. You are lucky because, consider all the belief systems that proceeded you before you got to this point- where you are ready to accept yourself for who and what you are. You are more concerned now, not what you believe, # and it&rsquo;s derogatory conditions to discard it. It&rsquo;s no loss. It&rsquo;s what you actually are now-what you are to yourself. That is what you have to go through. So once you accept that you and the Father are one, the comedy of it is that it makes life much more simple. The simplicity of it is that your loving your enemy for the first time for what they actually are. If you haven&rsquo;t got any more enemies, whose your enemy now? The belief systems are your enemy now not another person. So you realize what is yourself. You revitalize yourself and you begin to live. How many people in the audience here have read &ldquo;Autobiography of A Yogi&rdquo;? When Yogananda&rsquo;s teacher was suppose to have died Yogananda was torn up as any other person would be as a human being; yet when his teacher comes back and greets him Yogananda thinks it is an apparition. [spelling?] and Yog- ananda rushes up to meet the teacher and hugs him. The teacher says &ldquo;hey man let go, you&rsquo;ll squeeze the hell out of me.&rdquo; [Laughter here.] This hurts you know. like Thomas reaching out to Jesus. Gosh fellow, make sure. And Jesus comes through the door and eats with the disciples. These are the things that make people realize what the atomic principal is. We have had a lot of sudo ex- periences , but the general experiences are always genuine. That is why your churches decided to set up a difference between the psysic experience and the actual spiritual experience. The prayer &ldquo;I believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; means the correction of my own misapplied decisions. There are no sins to fear in this world but misapplied decisions. I have to accept that I must make decisions. I can make correct ones or incorrect ones. I have to live out the correct ones as well as the incorr- ect ones. Assuming the responsibility to correct them is my cross or, like you say, my burden, not yours. All realized people begin to realize it in the end; and once they accept the actuality of it they are living to live, therefore there is no sin. There is just trial and error in learning. You are learning by error, you see. You make a mistake to compare, not to make it again. To have life without mistakes you would not know where to go; but to have life in order to make mistakes you have something to compare now to move it. So when they say &ldquo;forgiveness of sins&quot;meaning we give ourselves more time to correct our selfmade incorrect decisions that we have lived we have to correct it ourselves. The saint is the same. Saint - a Latin word meaning sane. He&rsquo;s not trying to run your life. He at least has discovered how to live in a sane way by living to live, and the model is that they are there. They don&rsquo;t impose since thy are cosmic nursemaids. (Laughter.) You know, you hire a nursemaid to take care of the children while you go to work. Basically, when we realize ourselves what job do we have? We are all working for &ldquo;big Daddy.&rdquo; So who is down here undeveloped? Your brother and sister is another form of you Who is down here locked up in individualized states? It is the same God because it is life flowing in and out, and the interesting phenomenon is this: do you think the amount of life force that is inside of you is any different from the quanity in my body or anyone else in this room? They have tested this already. The amount is exactly three ounces. From the time they cut the cord you weigh exactly three ounces more after the cord is cut. When you finally quit breathing you weigh exactly three ounces less. So that three ounces of food belongs to? It&rsquo;s God in His creative nature playing roles of individuality. We are stuck in our big fat ego thinking we are going to hold on. We can&rsquo;t hold on to the wrong program of living to die. The ego is no assert there. In living to live we can be blessed to have the reward of keeping that process in the mechanism that no longer breaks down. The very same oxygen that keeps us going in living to die suddenly becomes an asset in living to live. Now if Jesus and all these great men didn&rsquo;t come to teach us to live to live we would not be celebrating the next two days, (Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday,) because that is the evidence we have. It is the next two days, how we accept these laws and look at it, what is open to us. Two thousand years ago we could not comprehend how to handle it. We are only fourteen years from the year two thousand. We have all the equiptment around us to validate, but man is eternal if he learns to live to live. But if he learns to live to die, he has to repeat the process over and over; but since this is not a mass exodus to God realization at the very individualist process, each one has his own cross to carry. I can&rsquo;t carry yours, but whoever arrives at that process and is established, becomes a cosmic nursemaid. (A Guru.) See-because what other love can we be applying once we arrive. We can only apply the love of inspiration, the love of confidence, the love of assurance, the love of guarantee to the individual who is struggling to work through their own individuality to the one reality. So it is like a a jigsaw puzzle and realization is like the turnstyle. We always slip out one at a time. (Laughter) So what do we have in our consciousness to work with? The most important thing is this journey of now, see, it is not going any place. It is called the journey of now, inward; and it sounds like a journey of going some place,, but you are not going any place. It is a journey of coping more than going. It is a big difference between looking at a place. It is a current in now, a journey of coping in the now. And since now and coping are all contained by the creative me, that is why Moses had to confront it: &ldquo;There is no God before me&rdquo; and &ldquo;do not have any graven image,&rdquo; Do not look for any image outside of yourself that is going to represent me. Me is already locked up there. You only can point to this one, me (yourself.) Me flowers, me leaf, me table. You don&rsquo;t like it? That is too bad! He will always be a flower to Himself; so I have got to come to the realization the me, God, is here already. Moses would look inside and say the burning bush is the light inside of your head. Who are you? I am that I am. Well, how can any object identify itself without using the words I am? I am God. I am a bird. I am a potato. I am Adano. I am lucky. I am. All the I AMs make it what? One big I am. You see? Even Jesus said &ldquo;I and the Father are one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; These men understood the reality of living to live and broke away from the illusion of living to die. And that is what you call the ignorance of ignorance. There is no sin. It is just ignoring and misapplying your decisions to your commitment; yet you have to come back to correct it. That is what is so beautiful about the process. If you are a teacher and you had a student that took and examination and he did not pass would you put him in the next class, or would you send him back to do it all over again? Right? So this is basically the fundamental unity that underlines all individual forms. At the individual level we have to confront our nature by trial and error. We may make mistakes, wrong decisions and we can&quot;t expect to go any further in understanding if we don&rsquo;t correct it because it will come back to confront us. The sooner you realize it the quicker you get healthy because-why? You don&rsquo;t feel as vulnerable any more. You don&rsquo;t feel trapped any more. That is why Jesus said confess your sins before your fellow man. Confront your mistakes before others. Re-evalute it and get on the ball with what? Living now! It is easy to resolve the anguish by talking then by holding it and trying to withdraw to avoid it. That is living to die. More and more as we become conscious of what we are we automatically face ourselves and internal healing begins because healing is already locked up in us. It is denied us when we live to die because we have already shut it out with some kind of a notion that we are going some place to get it, and when we do get there, it is not there; but if we accept it here in the now and it is locked up in the creative me and the individually I</p>

So no amount of truth in the world is totally isolated from fixation, orientation, and organization. All truth are locked in that way. The person who is in the process of unfolding has to discern between the fixations of &ldquo;who&rdquo; versus the actual of &ldquo;what is.&rdquo; And that is your journey, that is your cross, that is your challenge, and that is your accomplishment.

<p>Adano88_03_26_1SatsangQ1NW5 - 2:11 I&rsquo;ll put it this way, all the knowledge that has come down to us if we were to apply it in our simple way, day to day, these words could be your greatest measuring stick for living in the carbon based body, &ldquo;I accept the communication of the Saint.&rdquo; But Their communication has nothing to do with channeling. Their communication is actual manifestation of Themselves for you to check&rsquo;em out because They&rsquo;re your brothers and your sisters so They can&rsquo;t play games in your head. Therefore I accept that type of relationship. The next statement is &ldquo;there are no sins to forgive, but misapplied decisions.&rdquo; I accept responsibility to correct my own misapplied decisions no matter where I did them, I accept that responsibility to correct it and if you ask God, &ldquo;Is there a sin?&rdquo; He may say, &ldquo;Yeah, when you don&rsquo;t look at Me.&rdquo; Now who is Me? Yourself, you see? So that&rsquo;s why Jesus put in a nice way by saying, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of your mind. You can&rsquo;t do it with part of your mind, so it gotta be all of your mind so Me is involved in the all and with all of your heart, all of your strength, all of your breath, and your neighbor as yourself. Everything is, but that&rsquo;s the understanding that brings you to the&hellip; that you will resolve all the misapplied decisions that were done and correct them. 2:13 So that&rsquo;s valid, God will clean up His own act via the individuality. Individuality triggered it, individuality can clean it up and resolve it in the unified field, that&rsquo;s your true self. And last but not least, the atom is eternal, I am made from the atoms. I am 144 elements. I ain&rsquo;t going no place because who am I? I and the Father are one? Two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another? Am I immortal or am I just a figment of my imagination? Audience: Immortal. Adano: Good, then if I&rsquo;m immortal, then you make the declaration, &ldquo;I will do the cleanup, or the dirty work, because I trigger it off myself through my individuality as an opportunity to experience differential relationship &rsquo;till midnight eternity. In other words God, creating His universe out of a unified field, has to impress back upon His nature the highest integrity of individuality of assuming responsibility for the role as an individual. It&rsquo;s what you call Superman emerging out of Clark Kent (laughing from Adano and the audience). The maturity of the super being out of the individual. The quality that&rsquo;s inside of you that must emerge for, what you say, assuming responsibility for being you. Not afraid of it, not running from it. That&rsquo;s in essence what we are saying and it is there that They&rsquo;re trying to teach us and we&rsquo;ll constantly be reminded by it in all the different meditational groups. We&rsquo;ll have it more and more, seeing it everyday.</p>

<p>Adano88_03_28TucsonSatsangQ1NW3 - 00:22 So the person who is realized, he isn&rsquo;t wiser, or better than. That isn&rsquo;t what the word realized means, or implies. It is a person who has come to accept that each moment is unrehearsed, each moment is unique, and each moment is all they have. So some wise man wrote a long time ago, &ldquo;after looking through my life, I come to realize that I have to live every moment of my life from now on as if it were my last moment.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way he summed it up. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have any moment to look forward to or look back on. There is no way I can pick up yesterday or tomorrow. It is a respiratory principle and worrying about others wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. What we can do for others is keep the thought of a cooperativeness which you yourself would feel in your present time frame as you cooperate with your timeframe. This particular condition will go out to help others to sense this cooperativeness and it gets stronger in them and they begin to cope with situations instead of panic. More important is that you accept that there are moments in your life that you will be threatened with situations that you aren&rsquo;t prepared for, you&rsquo;ll feel competent or incompetent, but until it happens or you have to live it, what would you do, worry about it?

Your own spoken word holds up the geometry and your own spoken word separates the geometry. So if you’re going to be honest with your cells, you have to make the commitment and finish it by doing it and just don’t say it and don’t do it because they’ll pull you out from underneath and let you face your own dirt. See? So that is why placebo works. The scientist doesn’t like it, but it’s a preparation for the acceptance of commitment&hellip; Thank you. Well I guess we gotta hit the road. I love you folks&hellip;</p>
<p>Adano00_1AdanoQ4NW4 - Misc topics. Mantra means spiritual aid, designed to help you understand yourself. Psalms are laid out to show us an ethical way to live. Harassment is like a picador (bullfight) and well wishers in a family are like picadors. Meditation disciplines: focusing the eyes (pick a point / focus without blinking), art of breathing (I and my Father are One is a breathing technique), art of hearing (demonstration of Hong So technique from Yogananda), discipline of feeling (left thumb on right wrist and locate pulse, built in rosary / metronome). Story of Indian Chief and Minister from Assembly of God church, Chief is just wearing a blanket. Minister says &ldquo;Chief, don&rsquo;t you feel cold?&rdquo; Chief says &ldquo;tell me friend, do you cover your face in the wintertime?&rdquo; Chief pulls aside blanket and he is naked and says &ldquo;Me all face.&rdquo; That was a prayer technique that Adano learned. Story about a student (later the Swami that initiated Adano) who did not think he was making progress. His teacher asked him &ldquo;How long can you sit down and meditate without getting restless.&rdquo; The teacher and student meditated and at the end of one hour, the teacher nailed the student calf to the floor with an old rusty nail. Then healed the student saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the scar so you will know how far you are in god.&rdquo; Master Jesus was not suffering on the cross either. The most difficult part of the discipline is feeling. Body getting stiff during meditation is feeling diminishing in certain areas, but the mind is craving sensation. So it sets up an alarm system and end of meditation.</p>
<p>Adano00_01FromEdQ4NW1 - Not eating. Weight gain / loss. 10 36 radicals. Diseases are placebo. If you label it, you got it. Yes, no, and maybe of what is actually involved.

And your neighbor as yourself that&rsquo;s the key to immortality. Butterfly eats his way to butterfly-hood. Psychophysical synchronicity, a spiritual person is a practical person, moment to moment action represents immunity, disengagement of unity, free love w/o coercion, surrender timing to consciousness, can you act what you say, convex vision, karmic or spermal.</p>

<p>Adano00_2SolarQ4NW7 - The challenge for the mechanism is to work your way through. You can live / function minus the meat, but some blood types crave it: A and AB even though they are designed to not be meat eaters. They are designed to eat grain that has acid that doesn&rsquo;t affect them. However, they crave the experience of acid from meat. Type B and O craves to be a non-meat eater. 10 Story about man with amoebic dysentery. A little Sake helped it. 20 Sake is made from grass. Rice is a neutral food. 1 lb wild rice, 3 lbs of brown rice combined is the ultimate form of protein. Can be used in place of almonds. Short grain is a little more acid than long grain. Mucus can be caused by having grains at the wrong time (morning). Gas, mucus, and hardening of the tissues are signs of food out of time cycle. 30 We are at the mercy of nature if we don&rsquo;t have a stability backup like an anchor being carried by a boat which is only used during storms. Nighttime foods. 40 Vitamin C from nightshade plants like tomatoes and bell pepper. The tomato is a fruto-vegetable, a cross between the two. It behaves like a  bat, it flies and has no wings with a face like a rat. It hunts at night in the dark. Tomato climbs like a vine, but behaves like a fruit and has vitamin C that doesn&rsquo;t break down with heat. Don&rsquo;t crack fingers sideways. 50 Seaweed is for gonad and uterine canal plus eggs and fish for reproductive organs. Oysters for horniness. Iodine / seaweed for regenerative organs. Vitamins phase out in alcohol so nature has made the maguey plant (cactus) in the bromeliad family. The leaves are like the public hair. Genital problems that are toxic are solved by vitamin C. Herpes is a drastic problem with lack of vitamin C. Maguey plant (tequila) is good for this. 1:00 Story about man running race drinking apple juice, then orange juice when finished. Excellent results. 1:10 Different racial groups have different time to phase out cow dairy products (latest is around 21). Goat milk is alkaline in reaction. 1:20 Explanation of times for different foods. Most heart attacks happen after lunch from out of time eating. Giving them oxygen helps them at this time.</p>
<p>Adano00_3SolarQ4NW7 - Medicinal dose of alcohol is a teaspoon. Smells of apples in relationship to ripeness. 10 Farmers picking fruit at the range of malic acid smelling like ammonia to prevent worms from eating them. Light affects the odor of plants. Alcohol from potatoes, beets, etc. 20 The organs have to be fed and cleaned in each time cycle through fruit in each light cycle. Morning cleansing is the best time through fruits and nuts. Afternoon heavy meal and cleaning with grapes, melons, berries, and evening semi-heavy meal and pineapple. Daylight savings time is for economics. 30 Checking timing of the body at 3 AM. Environment is God and you are God. If the two aren&rsquo;t synchronized, then there is discordance. 3 AM = right nostril. 40 Story about Sonny biting into a hamburger with a toothpick and having to go to the hospital instead of going to the front lines of the war. Adano recommended that Sonny create pains in his body because he was too pure and was losing his immunity to pain. Sonny got sick one day and started losing weight. The doctor&rsquo;s scared him and he went on a long fast to clean up his body. Adano recommended again that he get some pain in his body, but Sonny went ahead with the fast. He called Adano to meet him at 6 PM. When Adano got there, Sonny had killed himself and left a note for Adano that said: &ldquo;I refuse to suffer.&rdquo; Adano went and got a bottle of rum in honor of his father who forced Adano to drink to cure him of his toxicity. He never got rum after that until Sonny&rsquo;s death. 50 Adano born during gallbladder time so he thrives on foods in the middle of the day (and he had his gallbladder removed). Adano got on the path when he was living in Canada in 1945. He looked for a 100 books on God. He was broke at the time and realized he wasn&rsquo;t being practical to survive. He had only $3. He was looking at a photo of Yogananda and turned over on his bed and locked the shutters. Just about midnight to 1 AM, he saw what looked like a firefly that moved. It got bigger and kept moving until it went to Yogananda&rsquo;s picture. Only the eyes of the photo were talking to him. The eyes were saying &ldquo;none come unto the Father, but by me.&rdquo; The next day &ldquo;Autobiography of a Yogi&rdquo; fell off the shelf. Adano recognized Yogananda&rsquo;s face on the book. He read the book from beginning to end. He wrote to Yogananda and Yogananda wrote back &ldquo;none come unto the Father, but by me. I accept you as a student.&rdquo; Adano then found a job as a chef in a Chinese restaurant. Then he took the SRF lessons and soon got a letter from Yogananda that said &ldquo;Prepare yourself for initiation.&rdquo; 1:00 He took a bath and sat down in front of the picture. In a few minutes, he felt a big thumb on his forehead. Adano&rsquo;s eyes started flaring up and he walked in that state for 7 days. He could see the future, but couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. It phased down after he stopped analyzing it. Adano wrote again and ask where he could get 100 books about God. Yogananda said, &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the book compared to 15 silence in the Soul.&rdquo; It took Adano 18 years to achieve this. 1:10 Maple syrup has iron. Cherries have iron. Black olives. &ldquo;A little bit of anything is medicine, too much is toxic.&rdquo; 1:20 &ldquo;There is a time, place, and a season for everything.&rdquo; King Solomon (King Solar-man)</p>
<p>Adano00_4ScienceoftheSoulQ1NW4 - God as the Divine Creative Intelligence, knowing our origins, in the science of the soul you must always get the same result / the same common experience, what the same common experience of man? = peace, bliss, God is not a person sitting on a throne, man must accept a wide scope of god that he can relate to tangibly, to a dying man God is the next breath which brings him joy because he has more life to pursue his desires, this joy is God to a dying man, to a man who is poor God is the joy of winning the sweepstakes or gotten an inheritance because he is secure now that he can pay his bills, removing his fear and insecurity. The common feeling is Joy. The person who is sorrowful and needs sympathy from his fellow man. The moment it is extended to him is joy. You walk out on the street and the rain is falling and your clothes are wet and someone comes along and offers you an umbrella, that brief Joy is God. He is making us realize through our very structure that He is the Joy of ourselves. The Saints call it Bliss, the Divine Rapture, ordinary people call it Joy. Prayer is the first link in the Science of the Soul, Jesus being asked how to Pray. Pray is a privilege and a two way communication, prayer brings results according to how it is applied. Prayer in a transmitting stage should be asking the Creative Intelligence for understanding. The second type of prayer is reception (the adult prayer), in this stage God is talking to us giving us ideas or inspiration to act in the environment. Some of us cannot accept inspiration from God because we have a mental conflict because we cannot tell fellow man that God has talked us. God is the divine broadcaster as a divine joy coming in the heart and this broadcasting force is coming through us to insure us against the pull of negative vibrations in the environment so we can face of obligations and work in the environment. Reasoning blocks the wonderment of consciousness (child-like quality), and reason causes the inner life to dry up, but Reason, logic, and experimentation is the second link in the science of the soul because it allows us to believe and know the creative forces, wisdom, divine reasoning, intuition. Prayer can be brought into a day to day experimentation alone or in groups, using our reasoning to plan and work in our environment, a proper, balanced existence in our environment and we are an extension of our environment. Prayer cannot create a microphone, it takes reason also. At 39 minutes, good summary of above. However, over attachment is a burden of reason and logic, so the next stage is meditation, how do we transcend the pull of our desires by the very things we have constructed around us so they don&rsquo;t become a burden to the mind. Meditation is that next link that frees us and helps us to transcend the pull. Meditation is the ability now to receive the thought waves from the Creative Intelligence surrounding you, flowing through you, inspiring you to the oneness with the Creator. The Soul is an extension of the Creator, like the image is an extension of the original form. Breaking the illusion that we are separated from Him. Example of the reflections of the moon in ten glasses of water, breaking glasses, mopping up water, and getting back to the original image (feeling the oneness back). Meditation is an acronym for Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities Towards an Intuitive Observation / Oneness with Numenon. Being independent of the five senses for the first time. A total identity with the divine life. You can&rsquo;t stay in that state, so don&rsquo;t be despondent when you shrink back out of that state otherwise you would be taken away by men in white coats. Joy from Prayer (sending / receiving), Joy from Reason, and Joy from Oneness of who you are because you are transcending the pull of the senses, lined up with the divine current consciously. Master can assume the karmic debt and extend the period of payoff without extra interest. The technique is called Initiation (baptism) drawing the energies toward an inward flow. See the radiant form of the Master. &ldquo;As many received him to them gave ye the power to be Sons of God,&rdquo; radiant light. Stories of life control: Jesus raising the dead, Lazarus (rich and poor), the Centurion&rsquo;s child, himself. &ldquo;My God, my God, why has though forsaken me&rdquo; was Jesus&rsquo; mantra from Psalm 22 allowed Jesus to pull the energy into the brain and hold it. Blue is Christ Intelligence, five pointed star that looks like a Dove diving down like when Jesus was being baptized. The Science of the Holy Breath is a gift, Master Yogananda empowered many to initiate. Initiation gives the person the key to shift gears so that you can go on.</p>
<p>Adano00_4SolarQ4NW7 - Certain illnesses require immunization, but to not become toxic wash the area with apple cider vinegar and put castor oil on it. Sake is the most neutral alcohol. One teaspoon of local alcohol when traveling as a natural immunization for the colon. Plantain must be cooked. 10 Cashew is a fruit (cashew pear). Vine ripened / falling off the vine is best for tomatoes raw, otherwise cooked. Sprouted beans have high content of nitrogen with protein or cook it with grain. 20 Mushrooms should be cooked otherwise the spores can take hold in the colon (manure). Story about New Yorker peanut farming in Texas not realizing peanuts grow underground. 30 Salted peanuts are not the best. Peanuts are needed for protein and for the reaction on the liver. It has a mineral that is ideal for the liver, making it elastic. Good for alcoholics. Raw peanuts are not the best. Two teaspoons apple cider vinegar, two teaspoons honey, and 8 ounces of distilled water is the only thing you should drink while eating. Eat a solar food after a difficult conversation to relax the body. Phases out the reaction of hostility. 40 Yucca has to be cooked. Uses for various foods. Dextrinization to make food &ldquo;high octane.&rdquo; Bypasses time in the colon for utilization. 180 degrees 15-20 minutes. 50 Almonds to set your weight. Add an almond for another 10 pounds, remove an almond to decrease 10 pounds. 1:00 Drink cold liquids to gain weight. Drink warm liquids to lose weight. Carbon dioxide causes bloating which is a result of fermenting toxins. Dancing is good to reduce CO2. &ldquo;Autopractic technique&rdquo; = working on yourself. &ldquo;Shake and shiver.&rdquo; 1:10 30 years to muck it up, 10 year cycle x 3. Three score and ten does not mean to die. It means to become the patriarch to show them how to live without the conditions. When people live to 100 then do more decision activity. So you would be eating less because it requires less heavy foods to make decisions, but the brain wouldn&rsquo;t be ready before then. You have to grow up and see it all before you make the decision. 1:20 When you eat and the time you eat it, attitude still plays an important part because even Jesus says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you put in that defiles you, it is what comes out that defiles you.&rdquo; The enzymes working on the minerals in the saliva creates toxicity from the sonic resonance of the words. It depends on how you say it. 1:30 Adano helps somebody with cramps. It&rsquo;s not the calcium, it&rsquo;s the iron that&rsquo;s the real problem.</p>
<p>Adano00_05FromEdQ4NW1 - The script is only 99% valid. 1% is random surprise which is reserved. He who is strong enough to wrench the dice out of the hand of the decision of Fate, changes the whole game, but you have to have the strength. The 1% is defying the laws in terms of existing conditions which he has to face. Kal is time. Sat is conscious. The path of the realized man is one of conscious exhortation by verbalization over the time relationship by anxiety. The universe is a sonic process geared down to geometry to exhibit time. Time takes precedence of geometry and sonics takes precedence over time. Optics is needed to examine it. Sonic can only be heard. 10 We must live our sonics. The movie Altered States showed the fallacy of chemistry over time. Adano falling off the building. His brain was operating faster than optics which allowed him to push off the building and landed on the grass by six inches. 20 Moving fast versus moving slow in people&rsquo;s thinking. Environment is synchronous with input and storage of one&rsquo;s nature and you can only synchronize your action to match it to survive and that is timing and you override timing by what you say to yourself. Insecurity is the only security. I thrive on insecurity. 30 You dream in alpha and theta, but not in delta. If you can stay in delta and be aware, you find out you&rsquo;re neither man nor woman. Dead men are all in delta, but they can&rsquo;t walk with it. Realized men are in delta, walking with it, and they know their neither man nor woman. &ldquo;Those who have eyes to see let them see and ears to hear, let them hear.&rdquo; Monroe Hemi-Sync tapes. I build biofeedback machines. Everybody can raise their body temperature, but it is very hard to lower temperature except in delta. When they photograph me, the upper portion of my lungs don&rsquo;t show up. Structure of the lungs: 5 lobes - two on the left and three on the right. Electromagnetic heart is on the right side. Jesus ascended to the right hand of the father. 72,000 nerve ends in polarity so 144,000. 40 Whirling Dervish&rsquo;s. Bio-oscillation to get ketchup out of a bottle. Bioemulsification of the Dervish&rsquo;s lymphatic system. 50 God is very mundane and very sacred. The sacredness of God is that we can&rsquo;t take away His job of making a creation. We have to survive and be satisfied to be a creation and Him be the Creator, but the beautifulness is the face that principle is embodied or in-resident in this organism as sonics, the ability to talk to one-self and by virtue of this embodiment and privilege, the atoms must obey me if I act what I say. It is that simple and that powerful and that dynamic, but if I don&rsquo;t, then I must pay the consequences by virtue of denial and lack of understanding and to be out of time is very obvious after awhile because you&rsquo;re going to goof up. 50 Question: How can I better time my stock market investments? Answer: I&rsquo;m going to answer you like a certain brother of mine told another friend. Your outer life, I have no control of, no matter you may seem to love me from within your heart. If ever you need to find central focus within your brain, close your eyes and see me if you can then discover what I can do for you at that point in terms of timing. As far as the external manifestation through your open eyes, I can&rsquo;t alter that for you. I can&rsquo;t eat for you, but I can help you to help yourself to eat correctly. We can&rsquo;t really alter people&rsquo;s outer lives. The outer live is your own responsibility, to make the mistakes and learn from it. Inner life is the relationship of gurus who can trigger a sense of unity with your nature. That is a different kind of relationship. I went to Las Vegas and won back every cent he spent to stay there. I don&rsquo;t want a penny more or penny less. I went four times to Vegas and broke even each time.

<p>Adano00_AndysHouseQ3NW1 - Andy Gallencia (sp?) in El Paso. Talking your problems with others is the healthiest form of therapy there is. Common exchange releases a lot of common illnesses in us. Yogic postures for people who refuse to change. Adano explains the Lion Pose, sticking your tongue out. Children wanting recognition all the time. They don&rsquo;t have an alternative to seeing this recognition. Parents can&rsquo;t let them get away with it. Adano helps a woman with her child&rsquo;s trauma with stomach problems. 10 What color comes to mind when you think of yourself pregnant with the boy. Blue. Can you think of any disappointment? Yes. Well that is carried over into the boy, in the pregnancy. 20 Continues to discuss the boy&rsquo;s eating problem and how the solution has to start with the parents. Like a mold with a scratch like an X. All the products made by the mold also have the X. You have to fix the mold. We heal ourselves but at the same time we heal our offspring. Yogis were psychological therapists grounded in physiology. 30 Yogis did a lot of biological techniques to heal people. Martial arts - built an image of the parents and attacked the images. (gap in tape). Alcohol kept in the mouth until the enzymes break it down from stinging to tasting sweet will not affect the brain. Melissa and Adano talking while traveling. Healing is not an occupation, it&rsquo;s a karmic debt that you&rsquo;re working out with people. When you work with sickness, this is karmic debt. So don&rsquo;t take it personally. Any other occupation you can advertise, but not therapy because you are working out karmic debts. They will find you which builds your capacity to serve. You&rsquo;re a channel for the goodness that flows through you to help others. 40 Initiation establishes the frequency of the therapist: Dissolving, eliminating, strengthening, and rebuilding are frequencies because you are correcting constriction / dilation which causes these conditions to appear. (gap in tape). Consciousness is a gun, words are bullets, don&rsquo;t monkey around with it unless you get hurt with it. A real therapist doesn&rsquo;t talk much. He can&rsquo;t have ifs, and buts, and maybes in his head. Once he finds the frequency, it&rsquo;s like a machine gun. If you know your frequency is strengthening, then you use it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the target it. I have a machine gun that will shoot it down. But you don&rsquo;t worry about if they have a fortress, or an armament, or armies, the machine gun will do the job. You go to the person and hold them and strengthen the person. It isn&rsquo;t you who is healing, we only act as channels for the frequencies. The fine tuning of your technique is called timing. I only touched Andy last night, I only talked to the others because they didn&rsquo;t have anything I could work on. They all had trauma. They were all traumatized people. (gap in tape). There are certain things you have to keep to yourself to earn a livelihood. (gap in tape). Story about sheep with stripes and optic photography planting information in genetics of organisms. 50 God is not always working in the way people want it to be. Explanation of how the pyramids were made by sliding large rocks over sand. The sand acts like a ball bearing and the limestone slides on it. Once positioned, they remove the sand with a brush. (gap in tape). Limestone doesn&rsquo;t cut with a saw. You wet the limestone and then you take papyrus, jute, or horsehair. Grease it and put fillings of sand and it can be cut. (gap in tape). Adano explains Astro-cartography. 1:00 So what did I learn? Enjoy Now because that&rsquo;s all I got. The nostril that breathes is the divinity that is me and there is nobody out there to punish me for good or bad because there is no good or bad. The good or bad is my game I play with myself thinking I&rsquo;m important or unimportant. When in actuality, God became me and He&rsquo;s having a ball allowing me to make an ass of myself believing I&rsquo;m doggone stupid or ignorant or all kind of muck-up. And all He did tell me from the start of creation, &ldquo;Go forth, multiply, and have dominion, but don&rsquo;t setup your franchise.&rdquo; So multiply means produce yourself as much as you want - trillions upon trillions of times, have dominion - play the game of running the show, but don&rsquo;t hang on to nothing. So oh boy, is that a game? (somebody says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a show.&rdquo;) Yeah, and when you live it out by going through it, He says &ldquo;Here, keep your suit. Don&rsquo;t trade it back in. I don&rsquo;t need it. It&rsquo;s already yours.&rdquo; You can modify it, make it look male, female, skinny, young, fat, or aged, but it&rsquo;s all here. Permanent suit, it&rsquo;s called Living Soil. See I don&rsquo;t have a Soul, I&rsquo;m Soul, Living Soil, 144 elements in an immortal. (end of tape).</p>
<p>Adano00_AtBettysConversationsQ4NW3 - Sounds like Adano &amp; Melissa traveling at beginning of tape, Trauma is a verbalization of something in the brain. Delta - to release trauma - yawn &amp; shit. Accurate + Pressure - Acupressure. Yawning is a suction. Delta makes you tired because you think you have to be tired in that state since it usually happens when you are sleeping. (gap in tape). Discussion of working for oneself. 10 Credit cards vs. debit cards. Future forms of currency (US postage stamps). Post office and banks will merge to eliminate fraud. 20 Adano talks about currency in the future using checks and thumbprints. Quitting smoking by smoking all cigarettes in a day during mid-day. Cigarette points on ear. Take three balloons and put their faces on the balloons and then pop the balloons. The cigarette is a dependency pattern. Sticking the tongue out helps. 30 Yoga took postures from animals and are the rules to make you healthy. Disciple means learning how to be healthy. The Lion pose is to build strength like the lion. Meaning of names Bobby May = he may or may not do. Bobby = Baby. The word Joe is a &ldquo;buddy buddy&rdquo; word, friends with everybody. More discussion about names: Adano = I dunno. What is a neutral name? 40 William = William the Conqueror (came to Adano&rsquo;s clinic years before). Liz Metrik and Harry - if she goes by Elizabeth, they are equal. He is a &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; experience. Adano says that he &ldquo;harries&rdquo; Liz. Harold of Hastings went to Normandy to recruit the aid of William, Duke of Normandy, to reclaim his land in England. A monk told Harold he needed a better name. William helped him reclaim his land. The last battle Harold refused to recognize William as his partner. So they had a argument and Harold took off to the land of Hastings. They had a confrontation. Long story short, Harold gets shot in the eye and William declares him King of England, &ldquo;This land is ours.&rdquo; This was because Harold would not pay William for his help. 50 Harold has two meanings: Harry=hurry and it doesn&rsquo;t have stability. It is somebody who constantly harasses you. Herald = to bring in good news. Saint Francis of Rome - She is the Patron Saint of all drivers. Dropped Saint Christopher because the church did not think he was a real guy. Russell means to russell up, to be active. The American Indians don&rsquo;t give a name until the child is 13 years old. Then the child goes out for 24 hours and comes back with a name. Adano tells the story of a boy Adano knew that came back with a grey eagle feather from an eagle he tracked that was molting and he was called Grey Eagle. He ended up taking care of the family&rsquo;s sheep. Yogini = Female unified consciousness (vs masculine Yogi). English does not have masculine and feminine because it started out as a dialect and evolved into a language, which is its advantage over other languages.</p>
<p>Adano00_BiosonicsTonesQ5 - Guy Manners speaking for a minute &ldquo;sound is the basis for form and shape.&rdquo; and the rest are tones from the Biosonics video.</p>
<p>Adano00_ChantsRamDasQ3NW3 - First eight minutes are Adano Chanting: Thou Art My Life, Who Is In My Temple, I Am the Bubble Make Me the Sea, Elemental Song, Door of My Heart, Listen to My Heart Song, and Happiness Runs a Circular Motion. The rest is not Adano chanting.</p>
<p>Adano00_ConceptsofA77Q1NW4 - Rest is timelessness. That is the meaning for the word rest. God is the eternal principle or creative energy is in the timeless state after performing everything that there is to perform in a time state called creation. Creation exists in time. Now, there really is no time as an actual principle. There is the illusion of time in which creation must exist or appear to exist. Now, in this appearance, a unit of time is the distance light crosses the width of an electron, giving its potentiality as a creation. There really is no thing called time. The only that exists is infinite motion to the highest degree of ultrasonic movement. The creator is audible life energy. He spoke before he became the light. It&rsquo;s not a person, it&rsquo;s a principle. &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo; Audible life current that is inside our own bodies. There is music inside of us. He who can see the lord in human form has seen Him at his best. Everything in this relative world is synchronized to time. The audible life current is that pure essence that exists in timelessness. It grants permission to its lower nature, Kal, the time cycle, to make a creation. God is a Sagittarian in opposition to Scorpio in the astrological belt. No matter how Scorpio tries, he cannot overrun Sagittarius. We are Beings of Light. The whole universe started in the sign of Sagittarius. It is the only symbol that is man and animal and the only symbol that is armed to protect itself. It must have the power of life over death. The bow and the arrow is the justice point, the self destructive principle, but at the same time upholding the law. Scorpio can only sting itself or kill you. It can be destroyed by the Sagittarian. Man brought his religion from the galaxies. Alpha Centuri is the galactic center and the Cosmic Life Force is vibrating there. &ldquo;The word IS god&rdquo; that makes all the difference when John wrote his works. So man doesn&rsquo;t search for his soul, man IS soul. 10 You can&rsquo;t take out the ideations of existence out of the universe, though you can change their atomic change. Even Jesus could not enforce a dictatorial dominance over the universe. He had to work by divine will, he therefore was at the right place, at the right time, for the right confrontation at the wedding. The role of the soul living in a time cycle that knows no boundary lines save love. The master obeys the law, but he shows by his love that the law has no control over him. All that time asks us is to face your obligations, no avoiding them. The highest form of therapy for a schizophrenic individual is to fight back. &ldquo;Mother, I would rather do it myself.&rdquo; So involvement is the key word in spiritual growth. Realize your involvement because you are alive and you have a commitment to yourself to face the time cycles and their repercussions. We do not have to reincarnate, we have to resurrect. (question from the audience) Jesus had to be asked. No master will usurp that right though he has the power to crystallize thought because he would be exhibiting his ego. Ego is best recognized as hurrying to do something too fast without waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s dispensation. Watch out and don&rsquo;t eat your words back by being in a hurry. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna do this no more.&rdquo; What do they end up doing the next half hour? Creative intelligence makes us realize that our ego is locked into the time cycle and the time cycle is going to throw us the confrontation immediately to make us face it to eat our own words. So if you are not in a hurry, sooner or later you are going to get the experience. Everything Jesus did could have been done in 24 hours. He was not in a hurry. A Master does not alter the thought patterns of people who don&rsquo;t want to be altered. That setup their own ego and block it. He works with those who are humble and those who are receptive and karmically linked because He Himself is Divine Love without coercion. He&rsquo;s unconditional love. Therefore He wouldn&rsquo;t use the person for His personal gain. He has no gain to have by performing a miracle because there is no miracle to perform. He brings their desires into focus by responding to the time cycle when that desire is supposed to crystallize for them. He knows exactly that split second when it was gonna happen. And if you live the spiritual life you&rsquo;ll notice the spiritual life is photo finish most of the time. Now I&rsquo;m talking from experiences now. Those photo finishes I love you. Adano sings the &ldquo;photo finish&rdquo; song. &ldquo;How I love you, how I love you, my dear old photo finish.&rdquo; But you see photo finish is good.</p>
<p>Adano00_ElPasoQ4NW1 - (Very bad tape). Biorhythms. Rule #1 don&rsquo;t panic, rule #2 don&rsquo;t panic, rule #3 don&rsquo;t panic. Who I am will kill me if I panic because I will think I will be saved, go to heaven and that bull. &ldquo;What I am&rdquo; saved me more than who. What I am is that I am atoms in the form of a tissue mechanism and if it don&rsquo;t breath, they bury it and if it does breath it stays alive regardless of going to hell or heaven. You gotta breath and who the hell would wait for a dead man to show up to torment him. Up your right nostril is god or brother Jesus, up your left nostril is Satan or Lucifer, in the middle is you, this piece of skin. (Ginger laughing). Looking objectively at the sperm getting to the ovum as being a winner. The rich man can&rsquo;t own or possess or own anything. (Gap in tape. &ldquo;This is Sunday.&rdquo;). Solar class discussion of basic minerals. (Gap in tape) 10 More discussion of basic minerals and carbon dioxide being both conserving and breaking down. Host and monitor elements. (Gap in tape) Cooperative and non cooperative guest elements. 18:40 Putting food in at the right time (or blessing it) to avoid the consequences of breakdown. Blessing it is a compensatory action, don&rsquo;t rely on it all the time, blessing food is only good 24 hours. (Gap in tape) 20 Prunes have iron to give you pep to do work and potassium to get you to go to the bathroom. Iron is of value to the tummy in the morning. Spinach, eggplant, rhubarb, grapes have iron in the midday. Beets for iron at night. 30 Tomatoes that grow on trees good with avocado, but not before 11 AM. 40 Gall bladder flush. Watercress and rice gives all 12 minerals. Do not cook things in aluminum, beer is not cooked in the can so this is ok.</p>
<p>Adano00_Flagstaff_DiscussionQ3NW1 - Jesus was a Jew and the servant was a Greek, so the man didn&rsquo;t want Jesus to come to his house. &ldquo;If you but say the word, my servant will be well.&rdquo; The subtle function of physics tells what is going on. &ldquo;Not in all Israel have I seen such faith. Go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Not in all the reality of the &ldquo;is-ness&rdquo; state have there been any form that breathes in the unified field that generates a conviction to the source of its origin until now to confront the Christ principle locked up in form as a request to insulate it against the feedback of the five senses of the sick person that is going to be imposed or abused or criticized by the surrounding community. Here you ask this shaman to come to your house. All these are interplays of the biological fears. When we get down to the atomic physics, we get to the core, &ldquo;go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; This is kinesiology right now. He is healing another individual at a distance by the command. At the atomic level, the servant is healed because he relates to his winning ness principle. The time lapse of the love has no limitation between forms. Pain is a necessary ingredient to stimulate respect and immunity. (Gap in tape). 10 God is a humorous kind of fellow. One person said to me a long time ago, &ldquo;we only meditate on God as man, you mean there is no female part of God?&rdquo; Yes, God is mother too, its a &ldquo;her,&rdquo; its not a &ldquo;ME.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;come let ME make man,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;come let US make man.&rdquo; So there is a father / mother God you see? It is only we who have been educated in this part of the world that think of God as father all the time. We totally ignore that God is both principles. You cannot have a creation with out both principles in it. The male / female or the positive / negative or the passive / active principle. So the scripture is accurate when it says, &ldquo;come let US make man.&rdquo; The word US is plural and man is a dualistic force of positive and negative, male / female, &ldquo;male and female created them.&rdquo; We have the male man and the female man. &ldquo;And God breathed into man the breath of life and man became living soul.&rdquo; But man is the atom, that is the image we are made in. So we say &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; or &ldquo;Atom,&rdquo; the proton or protean man. But a proton is only a part of the atom, there is one part that is constantly spinning out. Scriptures are very symbolic language. The rib of Adam is Eve, which is the electron. When you split the atom, you see the rib action. The orbital pattern of the electron spins around the proton to form the atom. And we don&rsquo;t live in an atmosphere, we live in an atom-sphere. We are an image, this physical frame is an actual image of the cosmic sound and light called God, pure light. Sound and light are the two forces. Light is the passive force and sound is the active force. So God the Father is the active force. The proton always carries the sound in it and the electron carries the light in it. This the yin / yang of the Chinese philosophy too. God is pure light or pure life, which is the neutron which splits in the atom. God is in his creation. The neutron triggers intelligibility in other forms of life to recognize this relationship. The god is me loves the god in you. God has become all. The neutron is in all of us. When you meditate, you look at the point between the eyebrows. The light is shining in the darkness, the desire nature, the cohesive function of the atom. &ldquo;But the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; Within this cohesive force, there is no comprehension going on, only observation. You are also doubting me, which is the darkness. The part that doubts what it hears, Satan, the adversary, the centripetal energy. When the atom is split, something has gone someplace. If you split six pounds of material, only 5.5 ounces are left. How did it get out of the container? We sing a chant, &ldquo;who is in my temple? All the doors do open themselves (endocrine glands). All the lights do light themselves (the energy inside). Darkness like a dark bird, flies away.&rdquo; You are triggering by meditation an atomic reaction in your spinal column, starting the process of spiritual evolution or spiritual expansion, speeding up your spiritual growth. Meditation is to help you realize God all the time, that He is inside of you, not outside of you. The process is to center. 20 Darkness comprehends it now. &ldquo;But let the light so shine before men.&rdquo; Shining with the exact replica of you. &ldquo;You see Me, you see the Father.&rdquo; That is breaking through from the electron level to the proton level, from the light level to the sound level. You will hear the actual sound the proton is making now. The waves are music set to the octave. The whole universe is a musical octave. In the octave, you begin to realize the Christ or the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; of god, the true light of god embodied in the proton, there is where the sound current goes on, the true kernel of your nature. Realization is the whole journey and it has to be inside the human body. There are two lessons, humility through ethical living. Two, the transformation of the animal body, the decaying body, to the non-decaying body that can dematerialize / materialize by divine law, like the caterpillar to the butterfly that never breaks down. To him that overcometh, I will make you a fixture in the house of the lord, an expression of this reality. When this body has thrown off corruption, it is a glory unto the lord. When we drop off the relationship of the electron and become involved with the proton itself, we begin to transform the body itself. Protein comes from the sun. Man used to draw the energy of the mechanism through the medulla oblongata. Man had that ability at one time but then he got engrossed with the electron. Man&rsquo;s body is composed of 16 elements. The atomic physics will verify how many times man has fallen from the protonic nature. As we travel into space, we will produce bodies with less and less minerals in the body. The more we change our environment, the more this body will depend on direct energy and less on solids and liquids. Between teenager to 40 or 50 is the gorge period, but after that it is tapering off. You ever try keeping up with a baby? Their protonic energy is active. The meditation is a technique and a process, not a goal, specially designed for the purpose of conservation of this energy. The advanced approach of conservation is to learn to appreciate solitude and inactivity, so that the body will have a chance to recycles / recharge / revitalize itself. We do this when we are asleep. The waking up is a reinforced thought pattern of getting up. We are far more tired when we are asleep. The spurt of energy comes from having to go to work, etc. 30 The disciples were criticized for falling asleep when they were meditating. The bodily structure wanted to taper off. We don&rsquo;t have to repeat the mistakes they made, we can utilize the feeling of waking up from sleep, and transfer this into a conscious sleep. So you are going to consciously close the eyes and consciously relive the feeling of waking up. You want to try it? Adano leads them through an exercise. 32 Put your feet together with the toes touching each other standing up. Turn the hands the way the feet are, turned out. Elbows into the side. Hold it for a count of 50. Enjoy. You feel loose and limber now? Hold the position until the hurting sensation ceases. It hurts because you are conscious. This is very spiritual. Adano leads a meditation now. (Gap in tape). Adano tells a story of a woman with several degrees who is a waitress. Maybe someday when she&rsquo;s ready to move on to be her own boss, then all those labels will be her presentation for her ability to run her own business. Now she has two kids who are almost 18 now. That is what Adano calls &ldquo;low profile attitude.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s amazing, some people know how to do it naturally. Adano comments on a woodpecker and proper attitudes toward animals.</p>
<p>Adano00_FlagstaffQ2NW3 - Meditation, giving thanks for enlightenment and unfoldment. The audible life stream has become you. Hearing the music and knowing it has become you. 20 Thank you. Any questions? Question: Would you talk about realization, what it means? Adano: In the early stages of understanding, most of us try to get to a state where we think we know and will never be ignorant anymore. This craving is what the eastern people call your delusion. You will continue to feed the fire of the craving to be deluded, but you will arrive at some preposterous, unimaginable place in your awareness thinking you know all there is to know. When it actuality, realization is the acceptance that god became you. According to Paul, after many years of his own internal searching and many unusual experiences over the control of the environments by his thoughts, he discovered how deluded he was and made this remark. &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the lord.&rdquo; Hence he left the room and went to work to be a tent maker and lived for the moment of now by being very practical every moment. Even when he died by giving up his life for his fellow man, he demonstrated the fruit of the spirit instead of the gift of the spirit. The gift is the miraculous power and the tremendous desire to think you know you know. The fruit of the spirit is the understanding that god became you and you cannot become him. Therefore every moment of the now, you are god in motion. You are not a god, you&rsquo;ll never become a god, but you are totally satisfied that god became you. Come let US make man, that is sonics and optics united to make a manifestation with a polaristic process locked up in it. Every moment you accept that realization, you will discover one fact about yourself, you can only live what you say to yourself. You can&rsquo;t take a bath in a blueprint bathtub. Therefore realization is not thinking to become, it is not a blueprint, it is an experiment with yourself. All I can see here is reproductions of self. Love the lord with all your mind, strength, and soul. 30 This marvelous temple is made up of 144 elements and everything else is made up of the same. Love your neighbors AS yourself. Once you let go of the feeling to insulate, that is when the rapport, the unification, and the intensity begins. You feel it like a tingling sensation. The more conscious you are of the tingling sensation, the more you begin to see the whole spirit (Holy Spirit), kundalini, pentecostal, slain in the spirit. You are unfolding in the energy field, biokinesis. Conscious recognition of it. If you look for the simple in the moment to moment, it will always be miraculous. If you keep looking for the miraculous, it may only occur once before you pass out of the body. In the structure of your nature, you have rates of acceleration of your brain representing states of consciousness. Oxygen is the only gas that produces the phenomenon of consciousness. Beta = photographic focusing, eyes are like a camera. Alpha = slowing down the lens, becoming more geometrically specific and not hazy. Selectivity synchronizes to purpose and is very exact. &ldquo;A man is as good as his word.&rdquo; Forced to live your thoughts or they will slam back in your face. 40 Theta = the geometry plays with unfinished actions. We never can finish all our actions, there is always a little left over because we are an organism that must live for tomorrow. Futuristic confrontation. This is the basis of attachment and the cause of all suffering. There we call the dream state. It is necessary to motivate you. You have to program it to replay. Theta is the reservoir of the unfinished dreams in terms of geometry. Delta = the dreamless state, where all geometry disappears in your head. It is blank. Peace that passes understanding. No more verbalization or analysis to describe it to yourself. But that blank is not an end. An end would generate geometry. That blank or peace is a competency or strength. &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; A biodynamic resonance that doesn&rsquo;t have a geometry, but has a vibrancy. The highest yoga is (Adano stands on his two feet and walks). God is for the living, not for the dead. The movie called Cocoon, fixated and liberated individuals. Even after he buries her, he still won&rsquo;t accept liberation. (gap in tape). It is a matter of accepting the christ nature in yourself. As you recognize it, you can exercise it. It has to do with your right to be a being. (gap in tape) 50 Question about the apples decomposing. Adano: First is moldy and powdery and that is the eliminative principle. &ldquo;Creativity energy flowing though me will eliminate all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of the individual.&rdquo; If it retains a little fluid / shriveled up is the dissolving principle. Dried up hard, no powder, no water, that is the strengthening effect. If it remains firm for a whole year and it doesn&rsquo;t collapse, it doesn&rsquo;t shrink, turn powder or watery, that is the rebuilder. Beta = eliminative, alpha = dissolving, theta = strengthening, delta = rebuilding, omega = apple grows, avatar, descent of god into flesh. Seeing at versus seeing through (looking at the subatomic particles). It has to do with focusing. Questions: Is there a particular meditation for each state of the apple. Adano: Meditation is a biological two way communication between the external geometry of the eyes and the internal geometry of the eyes. You have to sit back and listen. The program is already passing through the cells in the four different speeds, so just sit down and enjoy the show. You are the audience. &ldquo;Man must appreciate that he is a witness.&rdquo; 1:00 Close the eyes and watch. Then the levels will start unfolding. You will see the beta / powdery effect, then alpha where your eyes get watery, then theta where you are dreaming that Dracula is biting you, then delta where you enjoy the movie to the full extent, that is the rebuilding effect. Then if you decide you want to start your own movie, that is omega. Then you are living with it for the first time, no guilt or fear or frustration or making up for mistakes. The real anguish is if you think to stay something and it happens, you think you caused it. In actuality, you have lined up the brain to the unified field. E=mc2. You better not think or say more and you keep your mouth shut. And you enjoy living in the world in a simple, rational, humble way. Ability to be practical moment to moment is the test. The next test is how immune is he, that tell us how divine. If the saint and the sinner get the same disease, then there is something wrong in their practice. 1:10 He is not practicing meditation, he is living meditation, but you have to start someplace, so you sit down and watch and use a respiratory function to shift gears and observe. You will experience the sonic resonance and elation of the mechanism due to healthiness. You can live more objectively. The timing becomes obvious to you to act. It is not how smart you are, it is how soon you get through the gate of heaven before it close. It is timing. The summary of the meditative process is the timing of the daily events in your life, regardless if you close your eyes, is the evidence that creative intelligence is directing your survival. Then you are living meditation. Whatever you do will be synchronized to the time to be practical. When is the appropriate time to act. The wise man learns to function with the timing. Once you begin to focus that way, the moments of time will allow you to act.</p>
<p>Adano00_Hoovering1Q4 - All Cymatics sounds.</p>
<p>Adano00_Hoovering2Q4 - All Cymatics sounds.</p>
<p>Adano00_IMEBEQ1NW1 - Pain is essential to develop immunity. If you never had a confrontation, there is no way for immunity to develop. The highest process is to go through it. Pickup your cross and follow me. Each person experiences their own Scope of the Horror and not to be afraid of it, overcoming the unconsciousness of it. You can&rsquo;t become unconscious of the Me in you. The I is constantly reminded by the Me because Be will always be there presenting the bill to I and Me is the bill. So, for that reason, we gain this by the process of going through. When there is no more Me to clean up, would Be be satisfied? Be will not be satisfied, because Be itself would be bored and start again creating an I to give it freedom to generate a use for Me. Me would emerge again from the Be. Come let us make Man in our own Image and Likeness. Be cannot stay stagnant or non-active. Even if it creates I as a form of expression of itself with individuality and complete freedom to squander its existence. Be will forced to generate another Me. There is no way for you to be unconsciousness, non-existing, or non-immortal. When you lock into the immortal ness of yourself, in the I-state, Me-state, or Be-state you are unified, free men or lord of yourself. Health is Be - I - Me. You call it I-Beam, so you light up. Dreams are misfiled data and reruns of Me. I and Be are busy talking to each other in your sleep. The Me is sleeping. Me responds because Be uses it to confront I. Be stores Me and stores I and I has no place to operate in without Be. I could not come out into existence before Be. For that reason, Me is already existing with I and both are stored in Be. Then Be is greater than I and greater than Me, but Be is totally helpless without I and the Me operating in it, even though it stores it, Be would be useless and serve no purpose. Therefore, Be craves exchange and interaction between I and Me. Which needs your Love? Be. 10 Listen, Listen to my heart song. It is Be that sings the song and guarantees the assurance to I that the Me principle is there to back it up. But never I is going to sing to Be. I can forsake Be, but Be cannot let down I. The heart is neutral, the I is the upper part from the cervical to the top of the head. The Me goes from the Lumbar to the Sacral to the Coccyx. The Be is the heart in the center. The real love of God is the healthiness of your Beingness. I breathe, therefore I am. I relate, therefore I retain. I share, therefore I am everything. Then your creativity starts to flow, Be is creativity / self-sustaining. God isn&rsquo;t punching no clock, he is punching customers. And he is resting one day a week. Solar Nutrition - The fifth rule is &ldquo;Live to eat in order to live not to eat.&rdquo; Three score ten is the natural timing for the breatharian transformation. God has individualistic emancipation of society. Each person has their own horoscope. In one lifespan, there are three periods of development in each lifespan. 30-35, 45-65, and 85-95. 20 Abstain, injury situation, or natural progression. The natural progression process is for everybody. There is not other great or glorious contribution to the Creative Self than to live in synchronous harmony with it. I, Me, Be makes more sense living in the Now. 30 When all else fails, follow the instructions. The Garden of Eden is more of a focal point of behavior of Man. It is allegorical. Man had to make the &ldquo;make the mistake.&rdquo; All life forms have a blood type as a reminder process to interact. Macrobiotics found that the chemistry is 80 / 20 to be normal and flowing on time. We don&rsquo;t have years, we have revolutions, so you are endless and youthful all the time, like the movie Cocoon. Intrinsically you are atomic mass utilizing a tissue fold to interact. You are always living in the now with newer, better opportunity of exploring. Andy and Mary (Chief War Eagle), Andy used to say &ldquo;Life is simple, but difficult to apply.&rdquo; No one can see through your clumsiness. You have to work out your own clumsiness. Rule number 1, don&rsquo;t panic, rule number 2, don&rsquo;t panic, rule number 3, don&rsquo;t panic. Just keep muddling your way through. 40 Discussion between people in the room.</p>
<p>Adano00_InvolvementEmergenceQ3NW1 - The inner eye has to be open to understand beingness acting on consciousness and beingness acting on beingness. Now we as human beings can bring ourselves up to the Christ state, or the Master state. We must attain masterhood. We have to attain this state, &ldquo;none come unto the father but by me.&rdquo; We all have to come to that state of development. Then from that state inward, it is God himself, the Creative Intelligence, that pulls us up. We have a physical lift from the body itself and you may find yourself lifting off the ground going through these states or you may see internally how the electrical structure is developed and you go into what is called Moksha or liberation. But this is internal, one can&rsquo;t see this on a physical level, one has to see this on the extrasensory level. You begin to feel the body tingling and you don&rsquo;t crave solids and liquids as much. These are the outward symptoms of the change. A surely of consciousness permeates you. Because the ethical life has to develop before arriving at consciousness acting on consciousness. You judge your spiritual development by the length of time the peace remains with you in a conscious state. When it remains 24 / 7 / 365, you have reached the Christ state. 10 Question: The the Soul leave the body at different times? Answer: Man is Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t have a Soul. The chemical form breaks down, the electrical and causal (ideational) forms remains. The link breaks after 72 hours. Nobody is changed by Christ, they have to make the decision inside. Adano tells story about the man in Canada who was locked up for drugs. It was imposed on him by society to put him in a dungeon. He decided to pray. He eventually gets out after 21 days because he prays for forgiveness. He sees a light come into the room and a voice &ldquo;none come unto the father but by me.&rdquo; The Christ radiated his light into him. His finger prints have changed have this so they cannot prosecute him. Christ met him at the halfway mark. No matter how far you go, you have to make the turnaround. It might be dramatic or subtle, through love. Story of Saint Paul and his conversion. 20 &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why doest thou persecute me?&rdquo; He was doing it with mental remorse. He had internal conflicts in his subconscious mind. Story about Adano falling off the building and the physical body lying there with the electrical / ideational part went out into time and space. &ldquo;If this is death, I enjoy it. There is nothing to be afraid of. I and my Father are one.&rdquo; The Divine Consciousness told him to go back to teach people how to deal with pain. 30 Doctor having to take a different elevator and running into Adano dying on the table and saving his life. God acting through the doctors to have somebody who knew how to help Adano run into him. We have the right to live each moment and have divine life pull us out. Adano saw himself in oneness with everything, God is the Oneness, all the Realized Masters were there and made him realize that he was one with God. He only heard &ldquo;you and I are one.&rdquo; But can I stay here? But the Consciousness said &ldquo;no, you must go back.&rdquo; So then I accepted this, the first rule of the Consciousness, living by divine will. So the test is to go back into the body, that was his choice. If he chose not to go back, only he would suffer, not divine intelligence. 40 (Gap in tape) A Master is not trapped in the lower levels of consciousness. He can get out by remembering one basic truth. &ldquo;He that does the will of the Lord is my brother and sister. And he that follows in My word is My disciple.&rdquo; Following the words of the Master binds us to him through all the levels of creation. We hold back the Divine Principle by avoidance. You sense that your existence is eternal, but you are afraid something will be lost in you if you die. But the strange thing is that when you go to sleep, you do not know if you are a man or a woman. Where have you gone in consciousness? When you terminate physical existence, you don&rsquo;t have continuity of memory, you must reincarnate. It is the last desires that carry over to the next life. 50 You have been cheated of fulfilling your desire when you still have the desire in a baby&rsquo;s body. The whole mind is in turmoil. How do we free ourselves? It takes a Realized Person to enter your consciousness and raise you to the point where you can see this correction. The christ intelligence does this in a realized person. It becomes active at the last moment in the mechanism. There we can generate the consciousness to lock into your consciousness and release you of the desire. The Realized person whispers in the dying person&rsquo;s right ear, &ldquo;The check did not bounce and everything is ok and the Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; Helping the individual pass over in consciousness. 1:00 Adano shouting &ldquo;who is dying!&rdquo; to get his consciousness moving. The doctor&rsquo;s had been saying that he was going to die, the bickering made Adano &ldquo;over involved in weakness and over involved in strength.&rdquo; So say positive things in the presence of dying people. Find out what they are holding onto and help them break free of those desires. We can help the individual in these critical moments to break free. Taking full stock of what we are involved with and getting some sense of direction. Jesus saying &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be for me and for mammon.&rdquo; (gap in tape). Jesus going to the seashore when he got too &ldquo;bogged down&rdquo; by people. 1:10 Divine will is to recognize that &ldquo;you are always at the right place, at the right time, for the right experience.&rdquo; No experience is good or bad, but an opportunity to test your behavior. An opportunity to test your attitude that this experience is neither good nor bad. There is only one way to behave, that is to love. (end of Satsang, clapping). Questions and answers. How does man know if he is raising his consciousness. Adano goes through the levels: energy acting on matter. The light shining in the brain. (but the darkness comprehends it not). 1:20 Freshen up with vital consciousness. Energy acting on energy. The saliva will taste like honey / nectar which descends from the brain. Consciousness acting on energy. You can move physical objects with your consciousness. The time cycle responds to you. Story about Jesus turning water into wine. The craving of Mary was strong to have her son do something to impress. She tells the servants &ldquo;do what he tells you.&rdquo; The atmosphere is set with desire. If he had the desire, he would have brought wine, but instead he is satisfying the mother&rsquo;s wish, but still admonishing her behavior.</p>

<p>Adano00_Psalm4ChantsQ3NW2 - Adano explains Psalm 4. Brain emits full potential when eyes are 1/2 open 1/2 closed. &ldquo;Salvation belong unto the lord.&rdquo; Darshan radiates so much love, that 5000 people can be immobilized by the love / spiritualized. They feel like their vitality is going out of them. &ldquo;Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness!&rdquo; That means that the consciousness now responds with attunement when we utilize the right law of meditation. &ldquo;Thou has enlarged me when I was in distress.&rdquo; Consciousness expanded when negative thought patterns were trying to take over. We don&rsquo;t know what will happen when we start meditation. Cold sweats, pounding in my head, trembling, being pulled by the hair roots. When we are partially doubtful and partially calm, so they are afraid to continue and they avoid. David is showing how we should respond in this condition inside, 1/2 restless and 1/2 calm. &ldquo;Hear me when I call.&rdquo; Let me feel that the contact of the inner peace is flowing through me. My consciousness expanded beyond the negative pull when I began to meditate. &ldquo;Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.&rdquo; Let this conscious flow through me so I am competent to handle it and I know without doubt everything is working as it should. This is confirmation that the symptoms that are occurring in us in meditation are real. &ldquo;Oh ye sons of man, how long will you turn my vanity into shame.&rdquo; 10 The consciousness is saying: How long will you go on doubting the possibilities of the experience being genuine and what you think is happening to you is partial and not the real thing. You will try to accept partially, doubting. &ldquo;Oh ye sons of men.&rdquo; Higher consciousness is talking to egos. &ldquo;How long will you love vanity,&rdquo; the unrealistic thought patterns. They are not real, they are like show. How long will you try to seek after temporary conditions are not permanent. All the symptoms of cosmic conscious or god awareness are identical like sickness. There is a difference. Sickness is permanently there, creating a disturbance in your cells. In cosmic consciousness, you have an experience of it knowing that you are master of it. It doesn&rsquo;t affect, you transcend. &ldquo;Stand in awe.&rdquo; Accept yourself and be it (cosmic consciousness). Don&rsquo;t deviate, stick to the path, this is the discipline. 20 You really trust the lord when you are sound asleep. The bed is a sacred spot. Be still as if you were sound asleep. The initiate accepts and lives it out. He doesn&rsquo;t run from his environment. &ldquo;Offer the sacrifice of righteousness.&rdquo; Send up the thought &ldquo;Father, I love you.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t even know what he looks like and you love him. You have to make that particular attempt to turn you on inside. You have to trust the vital life power coming up your spine, kundalini. The science of the souls is very specific. The Psalms show you how to relate and make it work for yourself. Now we have covered the two types of people that exist, we covered the relationship of the government and the system that we exist in, these are in the first two Psalms. In the third Psalm we see now the head of the government has to find inner communion to offset the harassment that we call modern day lobbyism. So we are moving on now to man&rsquo;s happiness is in god&rsquo;s favor. How can inner consciousness gain contentment by total awareness, that&rsquo;s god&rsquo;s favor. The mind is not evaluating in terms of compassion, mercy, and grace, but only in terms of the insecurity. You can&rsquo;t live without relating to a higher part of your being as a supporting force within you. The man of spirituality is known by the fruit of his consciousness and his inner peace. Joy comes from within, not from without. One can have a bumper crop and still be discontent, but the joy you feel everyday is entirely different. It spreads out through your entire being and it starts in the heart center. There you hear the bells ringing inside, when the heart chakra opens up. 30 If the huge mastodons were here, what would have happened? They would have kept multiplying. Nature has a way of maintaining the balance. &ldquo;The meek will inherit the earth.&rdquo; Who will survive? The strong, or the weak, or the meek? It&rsquo;s the meek. The humble, attuned, synchronized to live itself is the meek, and he survives. He is accepting divine law. We are not here to run from the world, we are here to live in it. But only by living it can we understand it and understanding is the highest thing you should get if you are going to get anything out of spirituality. You can&rsquo;t carry riches to the grave. Death is a condition, if you understand it, you surpass it. Death is your last opposition. So are supposed to be free, in charge of this mechanism. Pituitary is the mental microphone of the mind. Broadcast, &ldquo;father I love you.&rdquo; This is the greatest mantra. Real meditation is a flow of love. 40 Total consciousness does not entertain negative living. It will fall apart. Jesus says &ldquo;call no man fool.&rdquo; There must be a reason for this, a karmic debt. Clown is a different thing. When you say a man is a fool, that is a different thing, you are cutting the very vital life principle, representing the creator, and addressing the creator as a fool. The consciousness cannot stand the fact of destruction by its own volition. Though it has the desire to destroy itself at times, but even then it cannot stand the fact because it is committed to repeat the principle all over to test itself. It will have to go through the process of learning again. It has to come back in another body form to learn out the mistake of killing itself. When we look at ourselves, to be happy, it must come from inside. 45 Chanting begins for the rest of the tape.</p>
<p>Adano00_RebirthingGuidedMeditationQ3NW3 - Adano guides the group through letting go of birth trauma through color recycling, &ldquo;first month, second month, third, fourth, fifth, six, seventh, eighth, ninth, the doctors are working, cutting the cord, and you are breathing in pure joy through your lungs.&rdquo; Black, grey, etc. indigo, violet, then changing into white light. &ldquo;Like a fog off the brain, light a weight of the chest, shoulders, etc. All through the toes, ankles, calves, kneecaps, thigh, hips, waist, chest, shoulders, necks, arms, top of the skull, the whole body is feeling the joy coming up.&rdquo; Yawning. &ldquo;You are the breath. You are not the body, you are the breath in and around the body, coming in and going out.&rdquo; 10 Yawn. Feeling freedom. Yawn. Equi-flowing now. Feel your oneness with the breath, existence, conscious, joy. Energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared. You are one with the chair, the floor, your breath, the entire room, the environment. Every sound becoming one and you are the container. Feel it coming up the spine. 20 Adano tells Bill Lockridge from El Paso that he was very steady. Modern man needs the equal flow because he is constantly driving vehicles and put into the survival decision making, so he needs the living in the now more than the agricultural man. 27 (gap in tape) Feel the air around your skin. That air blowing against your skin is creative love, sustaining the universe. Within that air there are many gases and they all have different fragrances. Only one sustains the consciousness and all the other accentuate our quality. The more you feel the warmth of the air, the more the love is intensified in your body. Feel all the texture of the skin relaxing, absorbing and nourishing itself from the air. You are nourished directly throughout the entire surface of the body. (meditation follows). Between you and the realized ones, the feeling of the air on the surface of your body. 40 (still meditating). 53 Yukteswar says, &ldquo;get up and sweep the floor.&rdquo; You can get lost in the drunkenness of peace. The joy of now, but the more you recognize it from your saliva, the more you are actually living on that ambrosia. That&rsquo;s why the ancient Greek gods lived on ambrosia and nectar, Mount Olympus is right here (probably pointing at the point between the eyebrows). This principle is flowing up in the saliva and oxygen that comes in to activate the whole form is the catalyst and the tongue that is designed for resonance of sonics is the bridge between the gas and the biological chemistry setting up the flavor in the mouth. Moving the tongue around the mouth releases the enzymes. You can tap into the enzymic process in the body and have the cells replenish themselves in the conscious level instead of the unconscious level of sleep. It is basically within the whole organism, but we don&rsquo;t look at it this way. When we understand it, we have access to the reservoir of all the truths that the ancient people were trying to teach.</p>
<p>Adano00_Solar1Q4NW1 - (must be in the 1980s because Melissa is talking around 15 minute mark.) Blood types and learning to cope with them. Put protein in first. Middle of the day, beans and rice are a complete protein. Seeds: sunflower, sesame, pumpkin. Type B or O have a piece of beef or lamb (less toxic). A little apple cider vinegar to reduce toxicity or a little wine (for the stomach&rsquo;s sake). The brain does its own self alignment through the silence level between 3-5 AM since the Earth exposure to Cosmic Rays before dawn. 10 Monotone (color) environment to slow you down and cope with routine better. Husband as confrontation reminder for the father. You can&rsquo;t tell Dad off because he pays the rent. Necessity is the mother of invention, the daughter is boredom. 20 80% alkaline, 20% acid. If you use a flesh product, always get some malic acid in your system to phase / flush out uric acids. Two teaspoons apple cider vinegar, two teaspoons honey, 8 oz distilled water. Drink two glasses per day. This allows you to be safe from the effects of the uric acid in tissue. Dextrinized bread doesn&rsquo;t make you tired. 30 Ghee made from heating butter and separating it. Two types of cholesterol in butter: white = insulator, yellow = lubricator. Ghee is better than meat to insulate and builds up bone marrow. Story of sugar, originally beet, but British found cane easier to grow. White sugar was originally for kidney disease (India / China), the brown sugar (rock sugar) was meant for eating. Yogis discovered white sugar good for restarting kidneys. Honey is neutral. 40 Cashews should be roasted. Other uses of cashews. Coconut oil is a saturated oil, ideal for massage and cosmetics. Mix it with plantain and breadfruit and it acts like a soybean oil and doesn&rsquo;t clog up your system. Cashews need to be cooked. 50 Potato should be cooked since it is nightshade family. Mushroom should not be eaten raw, can cause fungus in liver. Asparagus - cook it. Tooth therapy to keep teeth from falling out: swiss / cheddar / monterey jack, clove of garlic, slice of onion, and a little parsley. Then drink a little aloe vera juice or chew it with it.</p>
<p>Adano00_Solar3Q3NW2 - Trace minerals for kidney time, iodine working in both shut organs. In the middle of the day (from pumpkin seeds), at night (seaweed). Sea salt also has natural iodine. Selenium, iodine, zinc, and chromium. Zinc and chromium are in the same color spectrum with mercury and nickel. People with mercury fillings usually both people in the evening (6:30 PM). If you have a tooth problem, swiss / cheddar / monterey jack slice with clarified butter, garlic, and honey, and aloe vera and parsley. Copper affects spleen and heart. Gold / silver affects the small intestines. Arthritis comes from clogging of small intestine. If you eat meat, then put hot sake over it to take out the uric acid and reduce the arthritic condition. Marine life oils neutralizes the condition from animal fat and reduces arthritis. Aluminum is found in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It is also a trauma mostly for men and these are men who have been promised a retirement plan and just prior they lost it. Real mental trauma. The brain would not accept failure. Most of these people went into a shock pattern. 10 If you are focusing on a goal, then you are going to be let down. If you are focusing on the process, then you don&rsquo;t worry about what happens tomorrow. 9 times out of 10, it is the person punching the clock that has the problem. The more you cater to the process you will stay healthy to take care of your obligations. The process holds up itself. The trace minerals have another condition that we need to know. Taking it in a liquid form is better than other forms. Body toddy is the most natural source. Iron and Vitamin C go together very well. Tomato juice and molasses have this combination (in the afternoon). In the trace minerals you will also find opposite the organ there is a trace mineral setup to correct a problem in that organ. Lead is opposite to the spleen in thyroid area and the spleen has arsenic so if you phase down arsenic, you would need a trace mineral containing the opposite, lead. The final food that would compensate, a nighttime food such as ginseng or fotea (sp?) that would phase down arsenic or aluminum. Your major trace mineral is iodine, so as long as you keep iodine up, the other trace minerals can&rsquo;t have an effect. 20 Diabetics need to take a lot of trace minerals to stabilize, such as thyroid trace minerals. The bulk of people are hyper, not hypo, so they need something to slow down. Yogis have mastered the understanding of breath from umbilical to breathless state (not breath-free). That is the purpose of meditation, is to feel, holistically / osmotically integrating the oxygen. So they call it cosmic consciousness, able to see in all dimensions. Totally oxygenated, from head to toe, all the time by an osmotic process. Nitrogen moves the muscle, hydrogen creates the desire, nitrogen gives you the willpower to stick it out, oxygen let&rsquo;s you observe it. So you observe yourself craving to stick things out. You have carbon dioxide as a residue build up. It was a value at one level and a threat at another level. It will refrigerate you and preserve you or it can over refrigerate you and traumatize you. Less air is called the breathless state, from the nostril to the skin. The trace minerals are the transporters, working osmotically under the skin. You have the 12 basic minerals, the basic geometry. Yogananda used to pray to learn to live on cosmic frequencies, less and less on the solids and liquids. 30 Fasting causes the body to breath slower and tingle. In meditation, when you close your eyes you are trying to sense cellular osmotic absorption in your body. You can feel it like a tingle. 32:22 So here we have the right to eat on time by the light, the right to eat by lunar because of the pressure, and the right to eat anytime and bless it. But don&rsquo;t eat anytime and don&rsquo;t bless it because it will muck you up. (Comment from a student, &ldquo;But Therese Neumann knew the physics.&rdquo;) The thing is this, you learn the physics not from a school or a book process. After working with your body it becomes so obvious that they puzzle, &ldquo;where did you get your knowledge?&rdquo; You begin to see the phenomena is working through you. Your mind begins to zero in on it and then if you want to go validate it because you suddenly discover this wealth of awareness of yourself, you will find that most of the data is written in some book, but never put down in a way to comprehend it. So they are actually experiencing that today now. Adano explains Physician - Heal thyself as &ldquo;Physics I Can - Heal Self.&rdquo; You are the can that contains the physics and through your I-ness you can correct the flow of these elements in the cell and the osmotic approach is the direct interaction with the timing. Timing of iodine, stored in the thyroid. 40 Spitting when you get really mad so you don&rsquo;t have to swallow the enzymes. Then it will start sweeting up if you leave the mouth open and shake it up, then swallow it. We are getting more to understand the physics of ourselves. Working on people based on colors, but working on them at the right time of day. First take the age and go back. Age 35 equals 8 years, what happened at that time of life. Adano tells the story of his trauma at two years old. Individuality is god&rsquo;s costume. We are the individuality as the form or geometry, and we provide this entertainment for the unified field as the breath, the unified principle. The breath is the unified principle, outside / inside as oxygen all over the place. The one that creates awareness, not intellect, consciousness is like a camera, it records and plays back. The consciousness is universal. 50 If it is occurring in a mature body, it would be more indicative in the geometry. Mediation is a means to look at the thing more maturely. The more you correct it yourself, you are operating more efficiently. You are not avoiding mistakes, situations are opportunities to learn how to make a mistake, not to make a mistake, and not to feel threatened by not or making a mistake. Freeing the mechanism from  making preconceived assessments of a situation and getting locked into it. The moment you are working with determines what you are going to do. Adano explains the recent Chinese &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo; Then they have to discuss or a coup is the next stage. This is how the human brain is setup. 30 years to muck up, then the rest of the years are recycling years: 31 is a 4, 32 is a 5, etc. Adano tells more about his traumas a child, then falling off the building in 1955 as a way of working out early traumas. The body knows to correct itself if we allow it.</p>
<p>Adano00_SolarAtHoustonClinicQ1 - The first rule of Solar Nutrition is a little of anything is medicine for your system, too much is toxic. I will underline anything and toxic. And the person responsible for this statement is a guy called Confucius. The only problem with it is that a little for you is not a little for me, each person&rsquo;s little is different so we can&rsquo;t trust the word little, we have got to me more specific in terms of measurement. That&rsquo;s how come we find out research goes on today, what &ldquo;little&rdquo; fits everybody. So we can&rsquo;t say a little will work, we have to be more specific, if is a gram, milligram, or half a gram or whatever it is. That&rsquo;s what makes it work. 2:00 The second rule, there is a time, a place, and a season for everything and I am going to underline time, place, and season. The time has to do with your health. Your whole body is regulated by time. There is no way you can get around the timing when it comes to health. What you eat and when you put it in keeps you health, but when you put it in is more important. The place also regulates your pocketbook, if you are in the wrong place you will go broke. You can do anything you like, but you won&rsquo;t make it and in the right place, everybody wants to give it to you so that&rsquo;s evidence of fact. So they say &ldquo;go west young man&rdquo; and &ldquo;go east young lady.&rdquo; The man goes west and he&rsquo;s a cowboy and the woman goes east and she is in the chorus line. If you go north or south you may get stuck so it depends where you want to go, but that&rsquo;s the place. And the season, there is no such thing as season, there are conditions of nature so zero degrees moving forward to 32 degrees is a condition called winter, 32 degrees moving forward to 75 degrees is a condition you call spring, 75 degrees moving forward to 100 degrees plus is a condition they call summer, 100 degrees plus moving backward to 75 degrees is a condition called indian summer, 75 degrees moving backward to 32 degrees is a condition they call fall / autumn, and 32 degrees moving back to zero is a condition called winter. 7:15 The third rule is &ldquo;live to eat to get sick.&rdquo; See, that&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way. If you don&rsquo;t eat to get sick, you don&rsquo;t appreciate nature. You would be very egotistical and bombastic. So nature has rules and laws designed to make you respect her. One, there is only a certain length you can stretch you leg before she will snap it. There is only a certain amount of food you can put in your tummy before she busts it. There is only a certain type of food you can put in there before you vomit it. She is very smart so she knows how to make you sick. When you like to show off and put it in and think you can outdo nature with your mind, but nature runs your body. She doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot what kind of mind you got. Mind over matter, that&rsquo;s a bunch of baloney. It used to work years ago, but it don&rsquo;t work no more. Because why? You think you got a big mind, you are going to prove yourself and then your body lets you down and they bury you. 10 Live to eat not to get sick. Then it gets boring and you eat to get sick again. So the fifth rule is &ldquo;live to eat in order to live not to eat.&rdquo; A caterpillar is doing that, eating its way to a cocoon, then a creature comes out that can fly, a butterfly. &ldquo;Of all the creatures that can fly, there is none more beautiful than the butterfly.&rdquo; Butterflies do not rot and that principle is locked up in your body. Eating is a method to prepare you to live without eating. Because you &ldquo;process&rdquo; food and not &ldquo;eat&rdquo; it, you have to go to the bathroom. Don&rsquo;t confuse the mass you put into your mouth and the mass that came out as being evidence that you ate the food. The mineral contact of the biggest food wouldn&rsquo;t fit into the tip of a pinhead. You have 30 years to muck up, 30 years to clean up, then the rest of the years are yours. Three score ten is the transition time (70 years) to living on direct energy. Direct energy is sound waves which is breathing. 20 Mastodons carry their babies until they are 93 and lives 900 years, turtles live 100 years. Dinosaurs take 1,000 years to hatch. Moses took the scarab design off the walls of the pyramids. Early human left this design on the pyramid walls to remind people of their origins. The human body is a time traveler designed like a spaceship, but something was missing. It only showed the calcium distribution, but they left off the ambulators. From the top of the skull to sternum is the first layer of calcium formation (Zone 1), the second is from the sternum to the top of the pubic bone which is the lumbar region (Zone 2), and then from the lumbar to the anus or coccyx is the third (Zone 3). These regions are synchronous and Carl Jung is the first man to recognize this when he said the archetype is the pattern that sets the blueprint for the life form. You need the five requirements to stay healthy in your body: protein, carbohydrate, mineral / vitamin, liquid / water, lipid / oil. Needed for every meal in each of the three light zones. After high school you have to stand on your own two feet. From 18 - 30 years you can &ldquo;muck it up,&rdquo; the oriental calendar rat to the pig. 30 Each light zone must have Vitamin C and relate to the types of sicknesses. If you have a chest cold, tomatoes for lunch. Vitamin C in the morning is orange. Solar Nutrition is broken down into two functions: 21 days before the full moon = The Solar Cycle then three days before the full moon, the full moon, three days after the full moon = The Lunar Cycle. To summarize Adano: Three days before the full moon &ldquo;move the clock forward&rdquo; Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch. Three days after the full moon Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast. 40 &ldquo;Automatic, cruise-o-matic, cleanup.&rdquo; On full moon day anything goes. The reason it works is because of the pressure of the moon on the earth and you go to the bathroom quicker. The next thing you need to know is your blood type. A and AB can be 100% fiber eater, total vegetarian. B and O can be 100% tissue eater, meat eater. But nature didn&rsquo;t intend us to be 100% anything. Yogananda said that he was a &ldquo;proper eatarian.&rdquo; To stay healthy, you have to be 80% alkaline (fiber-fruits and nuts, vegetables, grain, etc.) and 20% acid (tissue, fish, eggs, etc.). Too much of either can make you sick. The balance between the two can make you healthy. The best tissue is the lamb which has the least toxic. 50 The cow and the pig are very toxic when they are killed. The lamb&rsquo;s blood before getting killed is toxic and after it is not toxic. &ldquo;Lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world.&rdquo; The deer is good also (for the hunter). Night time tissue is fish and egg. Male and female are worms and eggs. Male sperm is the worm and female has eggs. The egg ate the worm. A person with arthritis can eat lamb, fish, and eggs and get rid of it. You must know your blood type. Litmus (nitrazine) paper under the tongue. 6.5 to 7.5 is normal. Below 6 too acid, above 7.5 you are too alkaline. Acid person has a runny nose, full of mucus, always spitting up mucus, tongue is white and coated, hacking cough, and skin cracks with a yellow fluid coming out, and you ache. Also can have red spots on skin. Alkaline person has a pink, cracking tongue, dry cough, skin is very dry, cracks without fluid. Alkaline cancer is possible. When you are eating on time, you are alkaline. Melissa Wolf gives people a kinesis test. 60 Eating it and blessing it when you don&rsquo;t know is the saving grace offered by Jesus. But when you do know, you don&rsquo;t abuse it, you utilize the correct knowledge and if you have to use it outside the cycle, then you bless it. 1:05 Tape changes and Adano leaves, talking in the restaurant where they get pie. 1:10 Adano talking over breakfast to Roger Warden and a couple other people. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with the positive, the negative is powerful too. Anytime you slip back into the negative, you are going to get it, full blast. If you correct the positive with your mouth, what do you think you are going to do with the negative? The days of the play is over my friend. You are a passenger no more, you are the driver. Planet earth and the sun has moved in the last 20 years around Alpha Centauri therefore what you will be saying in the next 11-12 years will be crystallizing both positive and negative, faster and faster. In 15 years, Adano will be 80 (so since Adano was born in 1924, this implies that this tape was done in 1989). It&rsquo;s physics, it&rsquo;s not devil, it&rsquo;s laws of physics. That machine (the video tape recorder) was put together by physics. (In the video, Adano looks into the tape and looks through time.). Cooperation and doing it &ldquo;their way.&rdquo; Then tape changes again. nighttime now and people are talking over dinner. 1:20 Adano tells the story that he was born while his parents house was burning down. Miscellaneous conversation. Somebody chanting Nityananda Guru, Om Guru. Prismer music. Roger Warden tells the story of going to the dumpster at 3 AM and throwing away his smoking material. Adano says &ldquo;What are you worried about, you don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo; 1:30 (Somebody says that tomorrow they go on savings time, so the day must be April 1, 1989). More miscellaneous conversation. 1:33 What Jesus said was fact, &ldquo;but the Father in me doeth everything.&rdquo; That includes the thinking and your holding on to what you think you need and even what you think is your breath, that is His still. He is teaching you to be receptive and stop trying to run the show and enjoy the show, but he has given individuality and because he has done this, individuality is a freedom that allows you to kill yourself. That&rsquo;s why there are only three tests, kill to eat, kill yourself if you don&rsquo;t like it, or try to possess everything to be on top of everybody. That are the three tests that Jesus mastered in the desert. More miscellaneous discussion over a meal. The oxygen is pushed into us between 14.6 and 14.7 psi. The Russians and the Americans are getting ready to go to Mars so they will have to share their knowledge to do it. We have the launch power and they have the ability to keep &ldquo;the internal contents&rdquo; functioning better. 1:40 Big executives must have one hour twice a day in anti-stress rooms by using sound and light waves to deactivate the stress. Breath-less does not imply slow, it implies less repetition with longer pause between inhale and exhale. It is being done to you. Breath-free is not Breath-less. Breath-less is a condition of less repetition with longer pause in between. The period begins to run longer and the quantity per minute is reducing to compensate. Napoleon only breathed four times a minute. He thought it was a disease, it was an asset. But he did have some kind of problem that made him a tyrant, a dictator, imbecile, like Hitler. 1:45 God has a strange way to use a human body to make it stand out among society to mold it. We wouldn&rsquo;t have England today and other parts of the world if there was no Napoleon to mold it. It would stay in a corner and hide itself, but because Napoleon came along and did lots of things and forced the Russians to be somewhat more independent, so these were necessary things. Prana Yama was the old agricultural language based on compulsive guilt. We have to move onto what it is actually doing to the human being and what was it for in the first place. 1:50 Society fools itself by trying to make everybody equal, so the process was setup for individualistic realization / freedom because the Creative Intelligence has no intention of going out of business before midnight eternity. No master answers questions for the masses, it is for the specific individual&rsquo;s life frequency. It doesn&rsquo;t apply to a group, only to the person asking the question. What is all the knowledge in all the books compared with 15 minutes silence in yourself. But you cannot find an S-E-L-F, it don&rsquo;t exist, but you can discover 15 minutes silence, that is no electromagnetic static action in the cell. Which gives the experience of looking (Adano gives darshan), where everything is about to get transparent. And you think you are getting schizophrenic. They call it Darshan, full sight, and it is oxygen. (Adano demonstrates). Story about Yogananda going into the body of the soldier who got shot. Story about Trailanga Swami from Autobiography of a Yogi. Discussion of Prana Yama breathing. Prana means life and Yama means conscious relationship, not control. Consciously relating to the oxygen around you. Feel it, let is go through your skin and travel through your body. (train goes by with horn blowing and Adano is giving Darshan) Even the train is telling you. Now can you draw the energy of that sound into your body and feed yourself (Adano does it). That sound just gave me enough energy to go back to work without having to eat. Now you are recognizing what I am talking about. Don&rsquo;t try to steal the air. Feel the oxygen on the skin. Now you notice that your breakfast has all gone out of your body. Anytime you burp you are getting rid of the traumas. Let your eyes get oxygen. Now you notice the feeling is very clear, very centered, there is no stiffness.</p>
<p>Adano00_SolarQ3NW1 - Iron from the prune, iron from the almonds, piece of kiwi or peach. Kiwi is higher than vitamin C than orange. Almond will bond with citrus vitamin C. These all grow in Zone 1. The organs in Zone 1 are very important, especially the lungs, the preferential organ. 3:30 You need a little acid and you need a little alkalinity to be healthy. It is not 100% acid and it&rsquo;s not 100% alkaline, it is 80/20, you have to have the balance. That&rsquo;s one of the emphasis of macrobiotics, the acid / alkaline tone because modern science is hammering it away because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so obvious in the chemistry, but the time again regulates its beneficial results. The kiwi has more vitamin c than the black cherry. The kiwi and black cherry will absorb iron into the blood, but doesn&rsquo;t have citric acid to phase off the mucous. Citrus phases down quicker. If you are running a race, start the race drinking apple juice for malic acid, but then the lactic acid builds up, so you have to switch into a citrus juice that will phase down the lactic acid. Adano tells the story of the runner who kept losing races until Adano told him what to switch to orange juice in the second lap of the race. The sugar content of the citrus fruit is like &ldquo;high octane.&rdquo; 10 I had to prove it to myself first. The minerals and vitamins are brought into the body by the fruit, especially the skins and seeds, but then it is the oil. In the morning, get the three vitamins A, B, and C (most). C is the anti-toxin vitamin. Need to know what the vitamin C is made from. Corn Vitamin C can cause a clogged up stomach. Acerola cherries (best) or rose hips are the best &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; vitamin C. Don&rsquo;t just take the pills, has to mix with the saliva. I prefer to eat six meals a day, a small bowl of nuts, prunes, kiwi, cherries carries you through from 7-9. Then 10-12 you have orange juice as vitamin C backup, but also hormone balancers since we also run on hormones, not just food. Folgers coffee, not Maryland Club, mountain grown, one cup only with a teaspoon of Hershey&rsquo;s baking cocoa and maple syrup to sweeten. These three, taken around 10 AM is the hormone balancer. Take it in at spleen time for blood sugar regulation. Spleen and pancreas are interrelated. Hyperglycemia people have high blood pressure. Get irritable at spleen time. Hypoglycemic people have low blood pressure and get sleepy at that time. Hyper type can get diabetic, hypo type can get hypoglycemic. The cocoa comes from a cocoa bean, the coffee comes from a coffee bean, when they come in contact, the caffeine has no effect when mixed with maple syrup. A heart attack is lack of oxygen. (if they die at 1 PM in the afternoon). It can also be a lack of carbon dioxide. (because of gall bladder, if they die at a quarter to 1 AM in the morning). Story about the woman who died because she was given oxygen when she had an attack in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Adano00_StatementofLoveQ1NW1 - Saints and Sages of all religions. Brother Jesus, be though present and bless this meditation and open the hearts of these loved ones, free their lives from all obstacles, and bless them with the physical, mental, and spiritual unfoldment and may thy love shine in the sanctuary of their hearts. Bring them from the darkness to the light, ignorance to the truth, bondage to freedom, the impractical to the practical, the unconsciousness to the conscious. Release within them peace that passeth all understanding, Om, Shanti, peace. Repeat, Om. Adano does each 3x with people repeating after him Om coccyx, Om sacral, Om lumbar, Om dorsal, Om cervical, Om medulla, Om master, Om christ, Om master, Om medulla, Om cervical, Om dorsal, Om lumbar, Om sacral, Om coccyx, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, etc. 8 Godliness is practicalness, you will discover that for yourself. That&rsquo;s why this gathering today is not a religious gathering and the friends that have invited me here are friends. I love you, but I&rsquo;m not in love with you because to be in love is to fall out of love and then I&rsquo;ll blame myself for making the mistake, but to love you, we have a wonderful relationship, wonderful communion, very unending, very rewarding. That&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Adano00_TucsonQ4NW1 - The aging process is the inoperative behavior of the structure on time. Time is the distance light crossed the width of an electron, therefore the unit of time is measurable by action, conductance divided by resistance. We function in a time process, but we carry a ruler to keep track of it, it is called a watch. You are a light process and the rhythms of your light process are set. Transformation of carbon into the diamond and alchemy. Alchemy means &ldquo;all the elements&rdquo; but it built a philosophical structure to describe the mechanics of the 144 elements. But that label is not appropriate for today&rsquo;s time because it carries with it a sense of guilt. Chemistry doesn&rsquo;t have guilt, but the same laws and 144 elements are there. The reaction time is what we are dealing with constantly. If you are lead, you feel guilty that you are not gold. Al-mond means all the world, the 12 basic minerals that make the human body as a food, the most complete food. The physical body is in three rates of acceleration, the chemical rate, electrical rate, and the magnetic rate and they are all setup with chemistry. That&rsquo;s why solar nutrition takes food into the mechanism on time. We came to this country because we didn&rsquo;t have anything and our self enterprising nature pushes us forward. 10 Whenever a scientist makes a breakthrough in data concerning his environment, he is going to have to alter language from a guilt level to a non-guilt level, from a generalized level to a specific level, and no one is going to like him. 10 But if he doesn&rsquo;t freak out, he might be an asset to society. Ancient people used certain techniques to break away from environmental programming like mantra or repetition. What they are trying to get at is integrative part of your beingness where the creative reservoir is functioning totally unlimited like a fountain of youth inside of you. Freemen or lord of your cells. Adano sings, &ldquo;enjoy yourselves, it&rsquo;s later than you think, enjoy yourselves, you&rsquo;re never going to be pink, the years go by, they&rsquo;re always full of drink, enjoy yourself before they stink.&rdquo; This is nature&rsquo;s greatest contribution to creation, but it is taking us time to come to grips with it. We are moving out of churchianity into human dignity which is called spirituality. Churchianity had to mold itself from primal consciousness, from its agrarian heritage it was valid, but it isn&rsquo;t valid when it breeds sickness in the form of guilt. We have to come to grips with the reality that we are beings here for the purpose of expressing creativeness and therefore it is taking the laws of physics and chemistry to break away from that all inclusive frame, to let us look at ourcells for the first time without fear. I have one mantra, it is called Maha Asana, I will demonstrate it for you. Adano demonstrates. You see it, you heard it, it is called standing on your two feet. Delta has two functions, the first function of delta is this, Adano snores, the other state of delta is to get up and function and the moment of function is the moment of contribution. You are applying practicality. Delta doesn&rsquo;t have anything to offer other than to release, it releases what you have. It is the non ego level. Deep down inside of us is the urge to do something constructive. We are programmed to feel unworthy, once you begin phasing that off and begin to look at yourself actually the way you are constructed, free men or lord of your cells (yourselves). Delta is the observer, you paid the money for the movie to come on the screen. Yogananda story about seeing himself on the battlefield being shot in the chest. We have this phenomena going on in us because we are an expression of light. 20 The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second and the earth is 8000 miles in diameter. Adano explains carbon dioxide and oxygen and how it links everybody together with the speed of light squared. 22:22 Paul came to the final realization that the miracles were not the essential purpose of life, understanding the truth is the real purpose of living, how to function in a guilt free state. So he said &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing, for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; Meaning he was able to phase in and phase out on the cosmic tape called oxygen that produces the phenomena called consciousness or identity which made the intimacy of self beingness, worthiness now, the greatest joy. That was his rejoicing for the first time. He was rejoicing in self beingness. Whenever you do something that doesn&rsquo;t please the parent, they are going to remind you that you faltered. After awhile you get a sense of worthiness or unworthiness. But deep down inside, unworthiness also exists when the sperm are released to the ovum. You don&rsquo;t know if you are going to be a winner because nobody asked you to run the race. The struggle goes into the biological memory banks to determine the willingness to survive. You wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in this room if you weren&rsquo;t a winner. Adano explains twins and siamese twins as two sperms who did not slow down sufficiently to dock with the ovum. The creator has to put himself in all these different individual mechanic to test the love. Why is he testing love? Because he is endowing the creation with love. He creates us. We are created in this process and love is the principle that drives it to create therefore it has to endow the creation with love and give it a sense of worthiness, but a sense of worthiness is never appreciated unless there is a sense of competitiveness. You see it. You can&rsquo;t have a front without a back, a top without a bottom. This is a necessary means to develop immunity to cope with the environment. 30 So every law of nature is well worked out. We have to come out and live it at the intellectual level and assess it with the intellect. So you need your intellect, your programming, to evaluate the biological laws. Here is another mantra at the intellectual level, &ldquo;prayer unceasingly.&rdquo; Breath is only prayer because it makes a sound in the inhalation and exhalation called So Hung, Adano snorts. &ldquo;I am that,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the sonics resonating in the nostril with the incoming / outgoing air.&rdquo; When you begin to understand the truth behind it, you have to live the mantra by breathing. You disengage from the childlike behavior and get into the actual mechanics to live now. The mantra phases down beta to give you control in alpha, then it phases down the alpha to disengage you from the discordant geometry that is not stored correctly by memory tissue. You may say something and not take full note of it and that&rsquo;s where you have the responsibility for the actions. Repetition is an ingrained process for discipline. You can also chant or shout it or maybe mentally think it. Each individual finds his own idiosyncrasy, like Frank Sinatra, &ldquo;I did it my own way.&rdquo; You must find what is intimate to your nature and apply it. You will get the same result in the end, that is the delta level, totally devoid of geometry, alphabet, and numerals, and the strength of the inner consciousness. That is the level you are heading to. The paths are many, but the truth and the experience is still the same. Then you have to get up and live it.</p>
<p>Adano00_UmarkedQ3NW1 - Holding the little finger up while drinking tea is &ldquo;wearing their love on their sleeve.&rdquo; That connects to the heart, they are very vain people and controls the small intestine, they don&rsquo;t eat too much. Gap in tape. This finger controls circulation, sex drive, and elimination. Now this finger controls the lungs. Body language is already preset is already indicating how these forces are working inside. 2:20 We are so close to the experience of oneness if we can just program the mind to work with simple techniques. The oriental people have learned it so they use a candle, or they use a picture, or they use a photograph, something to center. And you say &ldquo;I want to merge with the Master.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the common term you use? &ldquo;I want to be one with the Master?&rdquo; It is the same as saying I want to be one with the little flashlight. The image has nothing to do with the inner experience. The inner experience is a bridge between the physiological will and the psychological will in order to experience omnipresence which is a sense of oneness or at-one-ment. This is also a feeling of outside-ness of your body. Yet you are never really outside. Because outside of where? You have always been outside, but you were looking down and trying to hold onto this, calling this the reality, but when you break the illusion of the psychological level and see that &ldquo;hey you&rsquo;ve been free all these years and never knew you were free,&rdquo; but dreams are the only way to help you to remember that you are free and most people get dreams that they are always traveling someplace, flying someplace. This is to remind you that you have always been outside. So don&rsquo;t block them, the idea is to recapture them and start focusing them. Adano explains physiological will and the psychological will based on Hatha yoga postures. 10 Adano tells the story of the composer who can see the energy flowing up the body. Adano explains the flows of energy in the body and the alpha machine. Long silent periods in tape while Adano demonstrates techniques to people. Sounds like Margaret is talking about the elemental song and singing it 16 times for all the elementals in combination. 20 Margaret fumbling around with the relationships between the elementals, interrupting Adano. Adano explains pressure in the body pulling downward and upward on the colon. Ascending colon not flushing lung and large intestine to block up. Descending colon not flushing causes spleen, liver, and stomach to block up. It has to be kept clean.</p>
<p>Adano00_Xmas_CosmicConsciousnessQ1NW1 - Adano gives a talk with an organ in the background. Come, let us pray with the deepest devotion of our souls, Om Brahma, Om Vishnu, Om Shiva, etc. Our beloved Jesus Chris, Supreme Master Babaji, Great Master Lahiri Mahasaya, Master Swami Sri Yukteswarji, our beloved guru Paramahansaji Yogananda, and the saints and sages of all religions, we bow to thee all. May the Light of Christ Consciousness flow through us as it has manifested in thy life. Open the doors of consciousness that we may perceive in this incarnation the universal christ consciousness throbbing within our hearts. Bless us that we understand the truth and feel thy love and may thou love shine on the sanctuary of thy devotion that we may awaken this love in all hearts. Om, Christ, Gurus. 0:05 Good evening folks, we are gathered here tonight, myself, Sonny, and Al to wish you a Merry Christmas. At the same time to participate in group meditation. I would like you to join us and commune with Christ. 6 I want to tell you something very important tonight and that is how to see the beloved Jesus within ourselves. You may ask, how do you see a person? The answer is the eye. The eye is constructed like a camera. It has a dark chamber, a lens through which light is admitted, and a sensitive plate through which the light acts. In the human eye, the sensitive plate is the retina. Light acting on photo sensitive chemical substances in the retina creating impulses that are transmitted to the brain which interprets them as visual images. When you hear a sound, it too is converted into touch. You not only hear, but you feel it also as vibratory sensation. Similarly, light does not go into the brain as light, but acts on the photosensitive cells of the retina. The result is a chemical stimuli activating nerve impulses that travel to the brain and are converted there into mental images having form, line, and color. The retina is actually a thin out pocketing of the brain around which the eye has formed. In fact, when you see a person, you are not seeing him, but a photographic image. The power of vision is in the brain, but if the brain is anesthetized, you cannot see anything. Even when you become absent minded, your brain does not respond to the impulses coming into it from the retina. You are unaware of outer happenings. Many years ago, our guru Parahansaji, when he was a young boy, happened to be in a state of Samadhi or divine ecstasy. His uncle was so alarmed that his uncle struck him in an effort to arouse him. Master heard him saying &ldquo;what is the matter with you? I struck you three times, but you did not respond.&rdquo; Master was so deep in concentration, he had no bodily sensations. His mind was so focused on god that all sensory perception of his uncle&rsquo;s presence and his slaps failed to register. 10 We seen then that we must have some form of contact and that is where the eyes are important. The eyes act as a two way camera. It photographs images from the outer world and also images from the subconscious and superconsciousness realms, the electrical nature. Our waking mind or conscious mind, reacts to retinal impressions. Observing images, objects, persons, that are in line with the vision. How then may a person see Jesus? This is the question tonight. We who have lived and have read of Jesus who has lived thousands of years ago would like to perceive him, not as a mental image, but the body of Jesus and the bodies of all saints who have lived on this earth plane and were immortalized in Cosmic Consciousness, God. It is possible and the Great Ones can appear before us anytime. 11:30 More so tonight, which is dedicated to Jesus. 12 How do such visions occur? There is a definite science to it. The technique is to focus your eyes at the Christ Center in the forehead between the eyebrows. When your eyes are upturned in this way, you shutoff the awareness of outer lights. Gradually, slowly, you will begin to see another light. This light is of a bluish color. Where does that light come from? It is the astral light of the brain, the electrical nature of man, that issues from the pineal eye or gland and the medulla oblongata. And that is reflected in your spiritual eye in the center of the forehead. This is the single eye of which Jesus spoke of when he said &ldquo;if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&rdquo; As you gaze at the point between the eyebrows slowly focusing the mind and thinking of Jesus, we will begin to see that it takes shape. 14 Now we know, that in order to see an object with shape, light is necessary. One cannot see in the dark, therefore all Saints saw in visions in a state of light, not physical, but astral light. It is necessary to shut of your physical vision first. To achieve success, the half open eyes have to be concentrated at the christ center. In order to see the astral light, you must focus your eyes at the astral center, calmly, without strain, relaxed, with deep concentration and devotion and in that astral eye you evoke the image of Jesus. Our Guru has seen Jesus many times. Jesus has olive skin and dark brown, his nose if flattened at the tip, his mustache, hair, and sparse beard are black. Keep your whole attention on that light in the spiritual eye. Don&rsquo;t try to visualize his appearance, but silently generate the thought at the point between the eyebrows mentally saying, &ldquo;please come to me&rdquo; and continue with devotion, &ldquo;please come to me.&rdquo; From that cosmic source, that light of god will materialize around you. He will first come to you as a small image and as your power becomes stronger, it takes on the full form. 20 When you open your eyes fully, the vision will vanish. You will have to try harder to see him when the eyes are open. These experiences are tremendous, but can be only achieved with your deepest desire and love. So meditate until you make contact. The blessings of the guru and the grace of god is with us tonight. If you don&rsquo;t see Christ right away, you will feel him. 25 I have been telling you this whole evening about Jesus and how to contact Him, but what is more important is the object of communion with the Christ Consciousness. For centuries, from Jerusalem to India, this earth plane has been hallowed by great souls who have all brought the same one message to us, that is the message of Self Realization, the Christ Intelligence which manifests throughout vibratory creation. A person cannot know of Jesus merely by reading a book on theology, scriptures, he must feel the presence of Jesus in deep meditation, he must have an experience of Christ Consciousness throughout vibratory creation. We must learn to seek this spiritual solace in the inner, immortal temple. 27 Let us enlarge the cup of our consciousness so that the Christ Consciousness can fill us and quench our Soul thirst. As we behold the Christ Consciousness in all individuals, families, races, creatures, we must finally experience Him in the spinal Christmas tree of the bodily temple. There we will discover the Star of Wisdom, the omnipresent Ever New Joy, the Cosmic Sound, Cosmic Light, Cosmic Vibration, Cosmic Wisdom, and Cosmic Love. Every year and every moment, the Christ is recognized in Cosmic Consciousness and the angelic beings all celebrate this glorious manifestation. Let us now celebrate this Christ Consciousness in our own meditation. Let us prepare the Christmas tree of the spine and let us place the eternal gifts on this beautiful spinal tree. The gift of eternal consciousness life, unconditional love, unattachment, service, understanding, self control, and self surrender. And as we place these gifts on the spinal column of the great cosmic Christmas tree, we behold the Cosmic Christ Consciousness permeating us in a golden, blue white light, flowing through us and around us and may this Consciousness lift us up that we be living examples of these glorious gifts and as we permeate our consciousness, not the physical body of Jesus, but the glorious Christ Consciousness that is in all creation, we will then participate of these glorious gifts that we feel in the spinal Christmas tree in the bodily temple. Om, Christ, Gurus. 30 Oh beloved Jesus, I surrender my ego to thy consciousness. May thy blessing flow through me to all these holy ones. As I touch them on their forehead, my thy blessing flow to them, granting them permanent Christ Consciousness in this bodily temple. And may they feel thy presence and behold the many masters who have made us conscious of thy presence. And may we live in this glorious consciousness and participate with this blessing. We thank thee. Om, Christ, Gurus. Adano stops for a moment, gap in tape. 37 Somebody else talking 40 Adano tells the story of Yogananda&rsquo;s life. Babaji, the Supreme Master and Avatar made this statement years before Yogananda was born. &ldquo;I see that you are interested in the West as well as the East.&rdquo; &ldquo;East and West must establish a golden middle path of activity and spirituality combined. We have much to learn from the West in material development and much to give in universal methods to the West in order for them to base their religious beliefs. You Swamaji have a part to play in the coming harmonious exchange between the East and the West. Some years hence I will send you a disciple whom you can train for Yoga dissemination in the West. The vibrations where of many spiritually seeking souls come flood like to me. I perceive potential saints in America and Europe waiting to be awakened.&rdquo; You see Master&rsquo;s life was preicted way before in a conversation between Supreme Master Babaji and Sri Yukteswar. Story about Yogananda praying for approval to go the West. Babaji came and gave him approval. This is all in Autobiography of a Yogi. gap in tape then somebody else talking. 50 Still somebody else talking. 60 Adano talking again. Beloved Master, perceive this great Cosmic Experience by gazing on the Supreme Master Babaji. Now, Master himself craved this experience to be a permanent thing within himself. Sri Yukteswar bestowed the divine experience of Cosmic Consciousness. The divine experience does not come by intellectual willingness or open mindedness. It descends through the enlargement of the consciousness and by devotion and through the natural inevitability of a divine nature, the student pulls at god with irresistible force and the cosmic vision is then drawn down within the seekers range of consciousness. Adano continues with stories from Autobiography of a Yogi. 1:00 Somebody else talking, the Samadhi poem. 1:10 Adano talking from these cosmic experience that it is possible for us, the disciples to daily experience this cosmic experience. As we close our eyes and gaze at the point between the eyebrows at the Christ center, slowly expanding our consciousness and beholding the golden light, the blue, the cosmic white star radiating, feeling our presence, traveling through our entire bodies into our rooms, the four walls. Beyond the four walls expanding to the very boundaries of our community, to the boundaries of our countries, and to the boundaries of other countries, expanding throughout the entire earth. Our consciousness is expanding to other planets, stars, galaxies, the entire creation. As we behold this cosmic chalice, this cosmic holy grail being filled with the divine spirit, the divine nature. We shall drink daily as we see the cosmic light and hear the cosmic sound and feel the cosmic bliss permeating our bodies and taste the cosmic nectar in our mouths and smell the cosmic perfume. Then we know, beyond all doubt, that we too are experiencing this glorious cosmic consciousness to which the master Paramahansaji came and brought the beautiful techniques for us to experience them. We shall daily commune with our cosmic nature and drink in this holy spirit. 1:10 Adano plays Yogananda&rsquo;s voice reciting &ldquo;God, Christ, Gurus.&rdquo; Oh beloved Guru, Paramahansaji, I surrender my ego to thee. May thy blessing flow through me and through my hands and to thy beloved disciples. And may they feel thy presence when I touch them on the forehead with thy consciousness. May that consciousness flow into their consciousness and permeate them. We thank thee.</p>

<p>The Cherokee word for soul is ada:n(v)do. It’s semantic meaning, deconstructed from its root, ada nv a, indicates that someone or something is in transit, moving from place to place. This transitory vision of this mutable and mobile essence has its origins, according to Fogelson, in the aboriginal Cherokee belief that four primal animate life forces emanate from the human body.
