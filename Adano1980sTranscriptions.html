<p>Adano83_07_26FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3 - Many of us may not know too much of the meaning of Darshan and even those who are initiated sometimes have vague understanding of the word itself, the mechanics, let alone what is involved in the experience.</p>

<p>Adano83_07_28_1FlagstaffSpiritualLifeQ2NW3 - At end of tape&hellip; Blood type explanation.</p>
<p>Adano83_07_28_2FlagstaffMemoryQ2NW3 - &ldquo;Death Experience&rdquo; as told at lecture on &ldquo;The Physiological, Psychological, and Spiritual Aspects / Dimensions of Memory&rdquo; at the home of Vasant Merchant. 1:45 The realized person has the total spectrum working for the first time in him. He has the total memory. So he not only sees, but he hears and feels and smells and can taste. That’s why you have to first put yourself in order. It’s like a doctor. He can’t be a doctor if he don’t take his training course. 1:46 Again, at certain age levels, the full spectrum opens up. Full spectrum awareness occurs between 30-35, in the first phase of a person’s evolution. Now if he doesn’t accomplish it between 30-35, the second phase of full spectrum consciousness is 45-65. Now if he doesn’t accomplish it between that second phase, then he’s got one more opportunity 80- 100 on. That’s why some records show individuals to have a late illumination in that awareness and others to have an early illumination and the majority falls in the middle. Now, it depends on how old you are now and trying to shift over. It’s like trying to say to yourself, “I just got pregnant today and I want the baby tomorrow.” You personally have to go through certain psycho physiological changing and cleansing routines on your own mechanism to evaluate and let it occur. So it’s not something we can push. It is something you have to let mature within, but you will get it. It is there for you. You may not know at which one of the three levels you are in for it to mature out. So don’t let that bother you. All you have to do is go on in and it will come out. 2:00 The universe is for Love, but not to be in love with it because the moment you say you are in love with it, you program out of love and you are going to fall out. You have incidents to go in and out of it, but if you say Love and you feel it, this is what they say the compassionate nature starts to emerge out of your memory banks. Creative life is creative Love, already locked up in you and all the Loved Ones that have gone ahead. They have so loved the world that they enter into it. When you read the statement “God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son” meaning that Consciousness, out of creativeness loves Its manifestation that It will constantly merge Itself into Its manifestation for the benefit of Its manifestation. So you begin to realize what a fantastic process of God’s Love is embodied already coming in. You can’t evade it no more. It’s not a mind thing no more, it’s not a brain, it’s heart. The heart begins to pulsate for the first time.</p>

<p>Adano86_03_28_3LivingtoLiveQ2NW3 - 0:13 All around us, we think we are seeing living people, but really, 99% of the time, people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they are 60 years of age and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically, but if they are living to live, they have this tremendous power available to them to be in the world yet not of the whirl, to be seen and not to be seen. 0:40 The most important thing in this journey of now, since it is not going anyplace, it’s called the Journey of Now. NOW. And it sounds like a journey which implies going someplace, but you’re not going anyplace. It’s a journey of coping, more than going. It’s a big difference between looking at it as a journey of going someplace, from one place to another place. It’s occurring in Now. A journey of coping in the Now and since Now and coping are all contained by the Creative Me, that’s why Moses had to confront it, “there is no god before Me,” and don’t have no graven image. Don’t look for any object outside of yourself that’s going to represent me. Me is already locked up here. 0:51 I’ll give you an example of an illusion and the actual truth. There was a priest who lived in a town and a big rain came and it started to flood the area. So the priest began to pray to God to stop the rain. Got out there, praying, and the water came up to his knee and all the parishishioners in the town saw him there praying and they came along with the boat and said, “Father, please save yourself. Come on, get in this boat and let’s go to the highland for refuge.” And he says, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go save anyone you find that needs help, take them to safety.” He kept on praying and the water got up to his chest. By that time a second boat came along and the people said, “Oh Father, please save yourself.” He said, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go and find people that you can save and take them to the higher ground.” They went off. By that time the water got as high as his nose now. Along came a helicopter with a ladder and said, “Hey Father, please save yourself, grab the ladder, the place is all flooded.” And he shouted, “No, no, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go ahead and try and save anyone that you can take them to higher ground. I am praying to God to stop the rain.” Finally, the water is over his head and he is standing before God and he says, “How come I’m here? I thought you would stop the rain?” And God said, “Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more do you want?” You see what belief can do in that fixated state versus when the practical is all around you for you to function. And that’s the problem is happening to many of us today, that we get so over fixated in the belief and when the practical thing is there, we miss the truth. Not that a miracle cannot happen to pray for the rain to stop, with God anything is possible, but I don’t think God is constantly manufacturing miracles because somebody get down on his knees and prays for it. When all the other varieties of ways for man’s survival and continuance is available to him. He’s just got to open his consciousness and recognize the many other opportunities that are there for his survival. This is what we are calling “Living to Live” instead of living to die. Living to die is a fixated state. Living to live is not. All the great men who have come down throughout the centuries all came to teach us to live to live. FROM MARJORIE MORGAN NOTES: Yes it is very auspicious tonight the whole week has been so miraculous, so unusual, (Easter week). On the way down here I was looking for a present for my associate in Texas, trying to get a birthday present for the person. I coudn&rsquo;t decide what to buy the person. We stopped at different places and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re coming along outside Gila Bend, I said to my friend who was driving, &ldquo;stop the van, stop right here, your going to get gas.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;no, the gas station if further down.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;no, the gas station is right here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop, stop,,&rdquo; and he pulled over to the side of the road and there is the gas station. I don&rsquo;t know if you know the place. It is called Cosmo Gas Station and Cosmo Restaurant. It&rsquo;s right on the way to Tucson. We go into the place to buy gas, and the owner had a little store on the side. I saw the present. It was a brass crucifix and I picked it up and somehow it didn&rsquo;t ring a bell completely. It was ideal yet it didn&rsquo;t fit; and I said &ldquo;well tomorrow is the crucifiction (Good Friday,) there is something wrong. I turned around and on the shelf behind me is a little dish-plate with the last supper painted into it. I said &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and when I reached for it I could feel the vibration , and the price was so appropiate. The owner started to laugh. We were getting something so beautiful for almost peanuts. But the person whom the present was for would appreciate having it and discovering it on a day like yesterday. That was so amazing about it. Now tonight we are discussing one of the most unusual moments in life-on Good Friday-that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about. Is it realy the crucifixon or the sorrow of death? Or is it something that leads to the triumph of what are we all living here for? Society is geared to live to die and it&rsquo;s not an ideal process. It&rsquo;s creating sickness. But you&rsquo;re got to live a certain amount of years to prepare to retire, to phase off, and be placed in the soil ,and to look for some nebulous region in the heavens, and you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually there. Then you can go along through life with tremondous conviction-it&rsquo;s there. But the real test is when you lay down and die. And then here we celebrate and remember a life that is lived on the planet and that is gone. Yet the challenge is not today. The challenge is the day after tomorrow. What happens? The triumph of death. But it&rsquo;s not so much the triumph of death&ndash; that is what you are looking for; what we are looking for is how to live to live and not live to die. All through the centuries man has lived to die and took out his vengence on his fellow man in order to eliminate it so you won&rsquo;t have to face it. And then here comes along an incident where the man Jesus raised another person from the grave showing that living to die isn&rsquo;t really the goal of life. Why raise another dead man from the grave if living to die, to find God is the true purpose? But living to live, to encounter God, is now in your immediate life, is the real challenge and the real experience. Yogananda use to say everything else can wait but the search for God cannot because it&rsquo;s a conscious now experience, not something nebulous and far beyond time. If you can&rsquo;t encounter it now in the waking state and really have the understanding and assurance of how it relates, you don&rsquo;t have anything. If you&rsquo;re all lying down dead in this room and God walks in and says &ldquo;Hi folks. What do you want,; your breath back, the power to perform miracles, or some possessions to make you the wealthiest people in the world?&rdquo; What would you choose? You sure would want your breath back! It doesn&rsquo;t look like much. It doesn&quot;t sound like much-right-compared to performing miracles and having possessions, yet you cannot perform miracles if you don&rsquo;t breathe. And you can&rsquo;t own anything if you don&rsquo;t breathe either. Is it in death or is it in life? When you understand where the real encounter is then you understand why Jesus said &ldquo;My God is a God of the living, not of the dead.&rdquo; Meaning, living to die has no assurance but it&rsquo;s the ideal way to function. But living to live is ideal. It&rsquo;s ideal because it guarentees it&rsquo;s ownself, it assures it&rsquo;s ownself. The ressurection is an indication of a guarantee. But more than that the principal is in nature. The butterfly is a model of it. The butterfly came before man because his enviroment was created for him to live in. Man-if you make man before you make his enviroment where would you put him? But you have to make the enviroment first in order to function in it as a man, male and female. But then you can&rsquo;t have someone in the sky constantly directing you. It won&rsquo;t make any sense. You have to place the laws of nature around you to allow you to discover by trial and error. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so beautiful about it; that each one of us is carrying his own cross and not the other person&rsquo;s cross. &ldquo;Pick up your cross and follow me.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t pick up mine. He picked up His today. Each one of us is carrying his own particular confrontation with life, not living to die in the confrontation,but living to live in the now, each one of us. Wherever you are, whatever your doing, that&rsquo;s the moment of confrontation. And it&rsquo;s the moment of living to live. So by leaving a butterfly as a model - the butterfly is a caterpillar - a worm - eats his way through life, spins a cocoon which you call a shroud, and emerges a different creature. Of all the creatures that can fly there&rsquo;s none more beautiful than a butterfly. And I have delibrately squashed up caterpillars and checked them to see how they rot, and squashed up butterflies, and compared them. And I&rsquo; never found a rotten butterfly but I&rsquo;v found rotten caterpillars, telling me without doubt that life is for living and not to run from it. And it&rsquo;s in that process when I look at the caterpillar I realized its tissue and I looked at my own body and its tissue. I am made of the same model. But I have one advantage over that caterpiller. I can muck-up my opportunity with my mouth; but he doesn&rsquo;t have to, he eats his way and becomes a butterfly. But I can make all kinds of mistakes with my words. Whatever I say to myself I get sick or I get healthy. The caterpillar doesn&rsquo;t do that to itself so thats my disadvantage and my advantage, how to regulate my spoken word to warrant the result of the process which is eternal body or nondecomposing bodies; or take it with you and you pass on into another realm. Now its not in the imagination. It&rsquo;s a natural face. We are already designed for it but our spoken word prevents us from experiencing it. When you say we are living to live we can leave the body as a testimony of a nondecomposing organism. That would defy the thinking individual. Or you can leave then an empty coffin and wonder where we went like Brother Jesus did. He left us an empty hole in the wall. And he&rsquo;s gone, but is He invisible or has He gone? That is the question. He hasn&rsquo;t gone. But He is visible and indivisible at command per- formances; meaning, He is here with us. We have to make the attempt to want to see the living in the living and not the living in the dead. All around us we think we are seeing living people. But really 99% of the time people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they reach 60 years of age, and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically. They are just occupying space chemically. But if they are living to live they have this tremendous power available to them - to be in the world and not of the world. To be seen and not to be seen. Now is may seem far- feched but it&rsquo;s not. There is a book called &ldquo;The Incorruptables.&rdquo; There are over 300 case histories. I&rsquo;ll put it this way: one case history for each day of the month or the year. And 80% of the case histories are women of non-decomposing bodies on record. So you see it has nothing to do because who lives to die most of the time in all modern society? Did you ever hear a woman say she&rsquo;s living to retire? We always hear the best is what? He&rsquo;s working hard to retire - right? All a woman says is that she is tying to hang in there. We have to change our programing. We had better had because it&rsquo;s not practical and it&rsquo;s producing more sickness. Resurrection is not a far-fetched process. Every religion has its evidence,. But more so, people who don&rsquo;t belong to no religion, who mainly realize by virtue of trial and error, by the process of being practical moment to moment, are arriving in that state. Churchianity has nothing to do with the realization of God. Realization of God is a personal interaction of life. You are the living temple of God. You are the living church. It&rsquo;s not some building like this that you go to on a Sunday. If God were to rest what would happen to us? We&rsquo;d be in a bad place. He can&rsquo;t turn off this equiptment called the universe. He has to be everywhere. So he is his own devil! By playing His own devil he tests His own creation. But we never ask about it that way. Once we begin to realize and live in it we begin to realize that God is and always will be. Not a person sitting on a throne. A principal that has become the universe locked up in man to talk back to himself. That&rsquo;s the funny part of it. Of all the creatures in the world to worship God, they know in the 80&rsquo;s. Man endowed with individuality to talk to himself. See, He has to convince Himself and that&rsquo;s the uniqueness of it. By becomming His creation and taking the roll of man which is flesh and setting up individuality in order to give it a sense of uniqueness. The individuality is the process of which the creator talks back to Himself. Now, when you are awake and you are looking at me right now you have individuality and you feel diff- erent. You may accept what I say or reject it because you&rsquo;re awake and you are hearing me talking to you in English and you&rsquo;re using your memory training because you are programed to English; therfore you comprehend what I am saying. I look Oriental so if I spoke to you: you would not understand what the hell I was saying to you, (laughter,) right? So there you go. What the hell is that guy talking about? You see, our words suddenly lose their sense of value, and their individuality has a problem. Now all of us go to sleep at night. When you are sound asleep do you know if you are a man or a woman, no matter if you spoke Chinese, English or French? You see? But God, He isn&rsquo;t going any place. He is still holding us together, allowing us to breathe; and if you don&rsquo;t wake up, it&rsquo;s over. That&rsquo;s facts that you have got to live with every day. From the dawn of creation when we knew the universe began, to when it ends - midnight eternity. That&rsquo;s a long time. So He is not going out of business, but he is providing a unique process by which His indiv- idualized manifestations can be permanent, and not resolve itself into a unified field. He wants us to be permanent by giving us individuality, by allowing us to experience trial and error to discover living to die or living to live. And living to live is &ldquo;To he who overcometh I will not send forth a second time but will make him a pillar in the house of the Lord&rdquo;, incorruptable. Or the option of that is to appear and disappear at will, still not corruptable. See what I mean? Look what you got when you begin to realize it. Your best friend, (Adano kisses His own hand here,) self love, not nartistic, cosmic. No greater love than he who would lay down his cells for his fellow man, but greater love is he who can recognize the God in himself. That&rsquo;s the greater love because I can&rsquo;t love you like myself. I can only love you as myself. There is a vast difference. See. &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of thy mind not part of the mind. So you can&rsquo;t sleep you know,. You can&rsquo;t die, that&rsquo;s the end of the mind, but that&rsquo;s no all. If you&rsquo;re going to love Him you&rsquo;re going to do what? Be alive, awake, alert and enthusiastic, and,with all your heart. It&rsquo;s got to be counted conscious now, all your strength. The respitory rate has got to be envolved, and soul. That&rsquo;s your individuality. You are soul. If you have soul it&rsquo;s preposterous to ask the body to save it. But because you&rsquo;re an individ ualist in the creative process, you can use your individualism to exhalt your reality and bring out the soul- ness of it which is God in you. Make it a permanent principal. If you have soul it is preposterous to ask the body to save it, but because you are an individualist in the creative process you can use your indiv- idualism to exhault your reality and bring out the soulness of it which is God in you. Make it a perman- ent principal. &quot; To him that overcometh&rdquo; - overcometh this flux - you won&rsquo;t have to do it a second time. We may be at a hundred million second time right now waiting to make the transition , but in making a pillar a pillar is a structure of something that doesn&rsquo;t change in the house of the Lord, in this whole crea- tive process. So the only way we could become permanent would be like the butterfly emerging out of the caterpillar - the incorruptable. As we achieve this incorruptable state we have the individualism still locked up in us to go back and forth in the universe being visible and invisible on command performance. For that reason early man created his communication by saying &ldquo;I believe in the communion with the saints.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a vast difference to say I believe in the communion with spirits. The saint was once a living human being who went through the transition of going from the visible to thje invisible, and from breakdown to nonbreakdown. Therefor he has no hangups and he has no games to play. He&rsquo;s not here to take advantage of you or try to get you into God. He is here to remind you that you have God in you. The psysic may not. Ge can be carried away. He is the moth that flies to the light and gets burned up. The butterfly is different. It doesn&rsquo;t fly to the light to get burned uyp. It emerges out of the caterpillar by the process of , gradual anguish, of eating it&rsquo;s way and comes out a beautiful creature that can fly. Tkhat&rsquo;s the transition of the true person. That is the path that the great man Jesus come to show. His life is that model in hhaman form taken from the cosmic law laid up in the caterpillar to the butterfly. All the great souls that demonstrate this are his brothers and sisters because the Christ principal is locked up in you already. That is why he said in simple language &quot; the things I do you can do also, but not greater than me&rdquo; - right or wrong? I know it is wrong because if he said that , then I say &ldquo;right brotherJesus, you are the only one and true son of God. I&rsquo;d throw myself down here because you are number one and will always be number one. But he never said that. He said &ldquo;the things I do you can do and greater things shall you do. &quot; It means the option to be free is locked up in you, if you grasp it and apply it. Because he grasped it within himself and applied it, he grasped the greater quality, the greater power locked up in himself. Now we have to grasp it. When it is put into simple language it simply means we have to grasp the desire to live to live and not live to die. Living to die is not the Christ state. The Christ state that will offer you death and it dies in itself cannot be a Christ state. It has to offer you life and remain as a living principal in itself. If God is life and God is in everything and endowers you and I with individuality to experience to see if you are willing to take a chance with your individuality at the conscious level. Unconsciously when you are sound asleep you won&rsquo;t know. That happens to you from the time you are born, your conscious,and you, must go through your life-part of it- unconscious; and you may go through your whole life with that portion of unconscious, never happening, never finding out what realy occurs, what realy happens in that period of your life. Who are you? What are you doing there? What am I believing or what am I actually trying to experience? A vast difference -what I believe versus what I actually am-are two different things-like night and day. I can believe in a lot of things; but it can turn out I may be wrong. Then I&rsquo;m destroyed with my delusion. What I actually am is not going to fool me because that is exactaly what I&rsquo;ll always be. Now I am atomic energy ! I&rsquo;m not going any place! Ancient man called it spirit. Modern man calls it cosmic force. Whatever you want to call it, it&rsquo;s not going any place. It is. Like it or not. When Jesus said &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father,&rdquo; you see this body, you see the cosmic principal. &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; This individuality and this principal are one in the same thing. We arn&rsquo;t going any place. You are stuck with it. Two things equal to the same thing are equal to what? Newton&rsquo;s law-one another. You and I -yes-are one in the same; but at different levels os expression called individuality. The realization is your moment to moment encounter. I&rsquo;m not here to mold you into anything, Iam here to find who I am. You are here to find out who you are. But we could be locked into a long time arguement as to how you will mold each other, and hate each other; and yet when we fall asleep at night all the molding is over (laugh,) and all the hatred is over and if we never wake up what did we learn? Nothing, because we are back right where we started to find out what we are when we are sound asleep. You see, thats why Paul quit trying to go around converting people. Do you know why he quit? It was when he realized he coudn&rsquo;t control his internal life. He said, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing.&rdquo; Meaning: You can go around rejoicing in your converting these Jewish people to become Christians. I quit because I live and die daily in the Lord right now. I don&rsquo;t know of any other process that I have found out that this is where it is at - not trying to con- vert. You can&rsquo;t make a rose into a daisy. A rose is a rose and a daisy is a daisy. Both have to get inside. I have to intergrade too. At the process of breathing we come into this world and we cut the cord. If we breathe on time they keep us. If we don&rsquo;t breathe on time they bury us. Then we start all over again. You are lucky if you think of it: you made thiry years, forty years, sixty years. You are lucky because, consider all the belief systems that proceeded you before you got to this point- where you are ready to accept yourself for who and what you are. You are more concerned now, not what you believe, # and it&rsquo;s derogatory conditions to discard it. It&rsquo;s no loss. It&rsquo;s what you actually are now-what you are to yourself. That is what you have to go through. So once you accept that you and the Father are one, the comedy of it is that it makes life much more simple. The simplicity of it is that your loving your enemy for the first time for what they actually are. If you haven&rsquo;t got any more enemies, whose your enemy now? The belief systems are your enemy now not another person. So you realize what is yourself. You revitalize yourself and you begin to live. How many people in the audience here have read &ldquo;Autobiography of A Yogi&rdquo;? When Yogananda&rsquo;s teacher was suppose to have died Yogananda was torn up as any other person would be as a human being; yet when his teacher comes back and greets him Yogananda thinks it is an apparition. [spelling?] and Yog- ananda rushes up to meet the teacher and hugs him. The teacher says &ldquo;hey man let go, you&rsquo;ll squeeze the hell out of me.&rdquo; [Laughter here.] This hurts you know. like Thomas reaching out to Jesus. Gosh fellow, make sure. And Jesus comes through the door and eats with the disciples. These are the things that make people realize what the atomic principal is. We have had a lot of sudo ex- periences , but the general experiences are always genuine. That is why your churches decided to set up a difference between the psysic experience and the actual spiritual experience. The prayer &ldquo;I believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; means the correction of my own misapplied decisions. There are no sins to fear in this world but misapplied decisions. I have to accept that I must make decisions. I can make correct ones or incorrect ones. I have to live out the correct ones as well as the incorr- ect ones. Assuming the responsibility to correct them is my cross or, like you say, my burden, not yours. All realized people begin to realize it in the end; and once they accept the actuality of it they are living to live, therefore there is no sin. There is just trial and error in learning. You are learning by error, you see. You make a mistake to compare, not to make it again. To have life without mistakes you would not know where to go; but to have life in order to make mistakes you have something to compare now to move it. So when they say &ldquo;forgiveness of sins&quot;meaning we give ourselves more time to correct our selfmade incorrect decisions that we have lived we have to correct it ourselves. The saint is the same. Saint - a Latin word meaning sane. He&rsquo;s not trying to run your life. He at least has discovered how to live in a sane way by living to live, and the model is that they are there. They don&rsquo;t impose since thy are cosmic nursemaids. (Laughter.) You know, you hire a nursemaid to take care of the children while you go to work. Basically, when we realize ourselves what job do we have? We are all working for &ldquo;big Daddy.&rdquo; So who is down here undeveloped? Your brother and sister is another form of you Who is down here locked up in individualized states? It is the same God because it is life flowing in and out, and the interesting phenomenon is this: do you think the amount of life force that is inside of you is any different from the quanity in my body or anyone else in this room? They have tested this already. The amount is exactly three ounces. From the time they cut the cord you weigh exactly three ounces more after the cord is cut. When you finally quit breathing you weigh exactly three ounces less. So that three ounces of food belongs to? It&rsquo;s God in His creative nature playing roles of individuality. We are stuck in our big fat ego thinking we are going to hold on. We can&rsquo;t hold on to the wrong program of living to die. The ego is no assert there. In living to live we can be blessed to have the reward of keeping that process in the mechanism that no longer breaks down. The very same oxygen that keeps us going in living to die suddenly becomes an asset in living to live. Now if Jesus and all these great men didn&rsquo;t come to teach us to live to live we would not be celebrating the next two days, (Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday,) because that is the evidence we have. It is the next two days, how we accept these laws and look at it, what is open to us. Two thousand years ago we could not comprehend how to handle it. We are only fourteen years from the year two thousand. We have all the equiptment around us to validate, but man is eternal if he learns to live to live. But if he learns to live to die, he has to repeat the process over and over; but since this is not a mass exodus to God realization at the very individualist process, each one has his own cross to carry. I can&rsquo;t carry yours, but whoever arrives at that process and is established, becomes a cosmic nursemaid. (A Guru.) See-because what other love can we be applying once we arrive. We can only apply the love of inspiration, the love of confidence, the love of assurance, the love of guarantee to the individual who is struggling to work through their own individuality to the one reality. So it is like a a jigsaw puzzle and realization is like the turnstyle. We always slip out one at a time. (Laughter) So what do we have in our consciousness to work with? The most important thing is this journey of now, see, it is not going any place. It is called the journey of now, inward; and it sounds like a journey of going some place,, but you are not going any place. It is a journey of coping more than going. It is a big difference between looking at a place. It is a current in now, a journey of coping in the now. And since now and coping are all contained by the creative me, that is why Moses had to confront it: &ldquo;There is no God before me&rdquo; and &ldquo;do not have any graven image,&rdquo; Do not look for any image outside of yourself that is going to represent me. Me is already locked up there. You only can point to this one, me (yourself.) Me flowers, me leaf, me table. You don&rsquo;t like it? That is too bad! He will always be a flower to Himself; so I have got to come to the realization the me, God, is here already. Moses would look inside and say the burning bush is the light inside of your head. Who are you? I am that I am. Well, how can any object identify itself without using the words I am? I am God. I am a bird. I am a potato. I am Adano. I am lucky. I am. All the I AMs make it what? One big I am. You see? Even Jesus said &ldquo;I and the Father are one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; These men understood the reality of living to live and broke away from the illusion of living to die. And that is what you call the ignorance of ignorance. There is no sin. It is just ignoring and misapplying your decisions to your commitment; yet you have to come back to correct it. That is what is so beautiful about the process. If you are a teacher and you had a student that took and examination and he did not pass would you put him in the next class, or would you send him back to do it all over again? Right? So this is basically the fundamental unity that underlines all individual forms. At the individual level we have to confront our nature by trial and error. We may make mistakes, wrong decisions and we can&quot;t expect to go any further in understanding if we don&rsquo;t correct it because it will come back to confront us. The sooner you realize it the quicker you get healthy because-why? You don&rsquo;t feel as vulnerable any more. You don&rsquo;t feel trapped any more. That is why Jesus said confess your sins before your fellow man. Confront your mistakes before others. Re-evalute it and get on the ball with what? Living now! It is easy to resolve the anguish by talking then by holding it and trying to withdraw to avoid it. That is living to die. More and more as we become conscious of what we are we automatically face ourselves and internal healing begins because healing is already locked up in us. It is denied us when we live to die because we have already shut it out with some kind of a notion that we are going some place to get it, and when we do get there, it is not there; but if we accept it here in the now and it is locked up in the creative me and the individually I</p>

<p>Adano88_03_26_1SatsangQ1NW5 - 2:11 I&rsquo;ll put it this way, all the knowledge that has come down to us if we were to apply it in our simple way, day to day, these words could be your greatest measuring stick for living in the carbon based body, &ldquo;I accept the communication of the Saint.&rdquo; But Their communication has nothing to do with channeling. Their communication is actual manifestation of Themselves for you to check&rsquo;em out because They&rsquo;re your brothers and your sisters so They can&rsquo;t play games in your head. Therefore I accept that type of relationship. The next statement is &ldquo;there are no sins to forgive, but misapplied decisions.&rdquo; I accept responsibility to correct my own misapplied decisions no matter where I did them, I accept that responsibility to correct it and if you ask God, &ldquo;Is there a sin?&rdquo; He may say, &ldquo;Yeah, when you don&rsquo;t look at Me.&rdquo; Now who is Me? Yourself, you see? So that&rsquo;s why Jesus put in a nice way by saying, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of your mind. You can&rsquo;t do it with part of your mind, so it gotta be all of your mind so Me is involved in the all and with all of your heart, all of your strength, all of your breath, and your neighbor as yourself. Everything is, but that&rsquo;s the understanding that brings you to the&hellip; that you will resolve all the misapplied decisions that were done and correct them. 2:13 So that&rsquo;s valid, God will clean up His own act via the individuality. Individuality triggered it, individuality can clean it up and resolve it in the unified field, that&rsquo;s your true self. And last but not least, the atom is eternal, I am made from the atoms. I am 144 elements. I ain&rsquo;t going no place because who am I? I and the Father are one? Two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another? Am I immortal or am I just a figment of my imagination? Audience: Immortal. Adano: Good, then if I&rsquo;m immortal, then you make the declaration, &ldquo;I will do the cleanup, or the dirty work, because I trigger it off myself through my individuality as an opportunity to experience differential relationship &rsquo;till midnight eternity. In other words God, creating His universe out of a unified field, has to impress back upon His nature the highest integrity of individuality of assuming responsibility for the role as an individual. It&rsquo;s what you call Superman emerging out of Clark Kent (laughing from Adano and the audience). The maturity of the super being out of the individual. The quality that&rsquo;s inside of you that must emerge for, what you say, assuming responsibility for being you. Not afraid of it, not running from it. That&rsquo;s in essence what we are saying and it is there that They&rsquo;re trying to teach us and we&rsquo;ll constantly be reminded by it in all the different meditational groups. We&rsquo;ll have it more and more, seeing it everyday.</p>

<p>Adano88_03_28TucsonSatsangQ1NW3 - 00:22 So the person who is realized, he isn&rsquo;t wiser, or better than. That isn&rsquo;t what the word realized means, or implies. It is a person who has come to accept that each moment is unrehearsed, each moment is unique, and each moment is all they have. So some wise man wrote a long time ago, &ldquo;after looking through my life, I come to realize that I have to live every moment of my life from now on as if it were my last moment.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way he summed it up. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have any moment to look forward to or look back on. There is no way I can pick up yesterday or tomorrow. It is a respiratory principle and worrying about others wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. What we can do for others is keep the thought of a cooperativeness which you yourself would feel in your present time frame as you cooperate with your timeframe. This particular condition will go out to help others to sense this cooperativeness and it gets stronger in them and they begin to cope with situations instead of panic. More important is that you accept that there are moments in your life that you will be threatened with situations that you aren&rsquo;t prepared for, you&rsquo;ll feel competent or incompetent, but until it happens or you have to live it, what would you do, worry about it?

Your own spoken word holds up the geometry and your own spoken word separates the geometry.

See? So that is why placebo works. The scientist doesn’t like it, but it’s a preparation for the acceptance of commitment&hellip; Thank you. Well I guess we gotta hit the road. I love you folks&hellip;</p>

<p>Notes: Adano00_SolarAtHoustonClinicQ1 is probably April 1, 1989.</p>
<p>The Cherokee word for soul is ada:n(v)do. It’s semantic meaning, deconstructed from its root, ada nv a, indicates that someone or something is in transit, moving from place to place. This transitory vision of this mutable and mobile essence has its origins, according to Fogelson, in the aboriginal Cherokee belief that four primal animate life forces emanate from the human body.
