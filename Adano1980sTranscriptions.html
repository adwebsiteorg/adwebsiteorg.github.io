<p>Adano83_07_26FlagstaffSatsangQ2NW3 - Many of us may not know too much of the meaning of Darshan and even those who are initiated sometimes have vague understanding of the word itself, the mechanics, let alone what is involved in the experience. Before we meditate the brain, before it entered the house, it&rsquo;s in a state of excitement getting here, trying to decide for the traffic, it really can&rsquo;t dip deep into the core of its structure. So at a satsang which means fellowship with truth, the individual who is the focal point who has been spending many years dipping into this potential of their nature, acts of a sort of a resonating device that lines up the alpha wave of the brain of the student so that the brain can then dip into a non-verbal state. So you feel like for a brief moment everything is suspended, there are no words coming up, you&rsquo;re in a state of expectancy but that state, that brief moment is known as Darshan, the whole sight, the devotion of heart, not of brain. There is no verbalization, the internal dialogue has temporarily suspended itself between left and right halves of the brain. Now it gives you the initiate and the word initiate simply means the individual who is going to work on their internal mechanism and has the privilege to work with it by being locked in to certain laws of nature and having prepared themselves by cleaning the body, making it less toxic, they can better resonate with their inner consciousness. In the olden days they would call that baptism and when Jesus went to John he said, &ldquo;You baptize me&rdquo; and John said, &ldquo;No you baptized me&rdquo; and picture two grown people arguing who should throw water on each other&rsquo;s head. But then he said &ldquo;Suffer it to be so for this is the way of righteousness&rdquo; which merely means relate to the inner laws by synchronicity with someone who has delved deep in to synchronize. That doesn&rsquo;t make the person superior to you or somebody pull you by the nose, it is like going to a battery charger and renovating the battery and bringing it back up to full charge so we do need these periodical encounters which is called Satsang. Now it can be in the presence of the person or in the absence of the person so we realize the form is not the connecting link, it&rsquo;s the attitude. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;suffer it to be so,&rdquo; it other words go in, suspend the internal dialogue so that the potential that you are begins to come up. Those who have never been initiated they&rsquo;ll also feel a charge that will stir them to want to know how to actually work in the detoxification and centering of themselves. It&rsquo;s a sort of an encouragement to the individual and those who have already been initiated, it&rsquo;s a reinforcement of what you call your annual carburetor tune-up, getting the machine to be more and more specific to its internal potential. So it has two advantages: one, it helps to suspend the internal dialogue that is so difficult to do being involved in living in this environment that is composed of sonics and you can&rsquo;t help talking, from the day you&rsquo;re born everybody&rsquo;s talking to you. Even when you go to bed, you&rsquo;re dreaming that someone&rsquo;s talking inside so you do need periods to suspend that dialog just to get centering. I know you may have lots of questions and answers that you&rsquo;re waiting for but before we take that as initiates, just to bring ourselves back to the important concept of our nature. One person asked &ldquo;what is the most important role as a human being?&rdquo; And this was the answer that came back from many many religious and spiritual leaders and even if you track it down historically in the writings, the importance is to realize you are an initiate of the highest consciousness, to realize that you have the tools to work with internally, scientifically to validate your true reality, and it has nothing to do with the individual or individuals who come and go, they are just the finished product. It&rsquo;s up to you to finish your job and go through the process and realize it. We pay respect to those who go ahead of us, yes, because they&rsquo;re the ones who innately sense their true potential either by sickness or some intense yearning from a previous life or because they have some function to perform while they&rsquo;re alive but whatever drives them to that research, from that moment on you&rsquo;re involved with a non-image, love for God. &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other graven image before Me.&rdquo; It is your contribution to the you in you to prove it once and for all that He became you and that&rsquo;s why they instituted initiation or baptism thousands of years ago and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what school or avenue we come from or use to get that, many roads lead to the door right here. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many roads it took to get here and I had to fly in an airplane to get here, yet I have to come through that one door, see what I mean? 0:10 The door is in the heart and that&rsquo;s how Yogananda would say &ldquo;Door of my heart open wide I keep for Thee. Wilt Thou come, wilt Thou come, just for once come to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even just once incarnation give me the living experience of my potential, restore my memory, restore my conviction of the reality that Creator has become his Creation. No longer lets me live in the conflicts or intra-polarity of the right brain and left brain. Let me center, let me have what they call peace that passes understanding.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a peace that the world gives, the world gives you six feet under the ground, it&rsquo;s called tranquility in the grave and may you rest in peace. The peace of the initiate or the Soul Potential is the strength of peace, the capacity to keep coping with daily challenges and going through them. This peace the world can&rsquo;t give us, only the Christ nature in you, the God nature in you gives you that from your self-confrontation but you need human beings to divert your attention to that point of reference. They may be called teachers or guides or Gurus, what is more important, not they, is that the student is not greater than the teacher and the teacher not greater than the student, they both got to go there. We both have to come to this door to greet each other tonight so our roles are not important, who is teacher and who is student, what is important we are initiates of the Spirit. We are initiated into the Spirit to find our own potential, we are baptized, we are brought into the inner contact devoid of outer trappings, devoid of outer images. We start off our early growth by relating to images and finally we mature into the one real temple because Creative Life lives in it. One of the hardest things in this process is to know another human being can hurt you after you&rsquo;ve done things for them, what would generate compassion from your heart for them? Yet a parent has to generate compassion for his child regardless if the child does all kinds of things. So you&rsquo;re given preparation in compassionate love from the time you become a parent, let alone humanity. That is the basis of the growth of your spirituality, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking for. It&rsquo;s a non-verbal relationship, more and more it&rsquo;s the internal joyousness to release it but even teachers get angry and tear down the money changers you know and drive them out of the church saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it a gambling place.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll spank us once in a while or pull our ears and let us know &ldquo;quit your nonsense&rdquo; once in a while, get on the ball and look in at yourself, that comes occasionally. So sometimes there are a lot of dry periods in your spiritual process when you feel that you&rsquo;re left out but you&rsquo;re not. As soon as the internal dialogue suspends itself, it&rsquo;s flashing up again, the realization goes up. And that&rsquo;s why the institution or the idea came of &ldquo;when two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; This is more intended scientifically for the initiate than for the regular person who is just interested in meeting in a meditation meeting because the real communication goes on with the initiate from that standpoint with his own Christ nature. He is pulling together his Christ nature and allowing it to release its potential through this mechanism. That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;when two or three are gathered in My name,&rdquo; not in me Jesus or me Adano, it&rsquo;s when we as initiates gather into the sense of remembrance at the time of initiation, that contact it pulls and nurtures and feeds and a Darshan, or whole sight, total sight, that is the capacity to see through, not see at. It&rsquo;s a feeling that you sense when it&rsquo;s occurring like a suspension, that is the whole name, &ldquo;in My name.&rdquo; The Creative Intelligence is Sonics and we can call Him God or Father, some people call Him all types of names. American Indians call Him Great Spirit but it&rsquo;s a vibrancy that is exchanged at the human level, that makes it more important as an experience than something that has happening and there are no human beings around. It is when you meet another human being and that human being is locking into the potential and can allow this vibrancy to emanate, then you in turn, it&rsquo;s like a magnet, you become magnetized, you can now release it yourself, it works through you also. My experience came from my teacher and I give the credit to him and he will always say his came from his teacher and we all go back and say &ldquo;Okay God, You did Your thing&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s fine and good, we respect that. The important thing is that you know it works and you know it exists and it&rsquo;s not a verbal experience, it&rsquo;s a non-verbal experience of presence. Meditation is the nurturing and trying to always retain the feeling of the Darshan or the effect or the sensation that occurred during initiation. Meditation is that particular nurturing attitude to recapture it or to re-enhance it and the more you meditate, the more you&rsquo;ll re-enhance it to the extent where it starts bubbling inside of you. Put it this way, my good friend the Pentecostal minister says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need no alcohol from the bottle, I got enough alcohol going inside of me, it bubbles into champagne&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s what this sensation of the whole Spirit the whole sight is all about is that same principle. 0:20 This sensitivity of knowing that it&rsquo;s waves that suspend the verbal dialogue and allow you to feel and reach out to the memory banks of various levels of yourself. Now I know when you take a little drink you always feel like like you&rsquo;re &ldquo;out there?&rdquo; Good. As my friend would say, &ldquo;this is a natural high,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to enhance. The main goal behind that or process behind that more than a goal is a cellular transformation is occurring in you though you may not realize it at the time. As an initiate as you become more conscious and meditate, that means enhancing and trying to re-enhance that feeling and having the verbal dialogue suspending itself more and more, an immunity begins to increase. You can cut yourself it heals very fast, you can seem to deprive yourself of many things you couldn&rsquo;t do before and a gradual strength and self-confidence, a strength of peace to cope with conditions of life becomes obvious, you&rsquo;re getting stronger in yourself. You realize that and you&rsquo;re no longer running to find the happiness in secluded areas, you&rsquo;re standing on your two feet and experiencing the happiness and the peace of mind right where you are. You start out searching and running to different areas for the peace, only to return back to find it&rsquo;s already bubbling up. That is to say in the early stages of your encounter with Spirit you&rsquo;re like the grape on the vine, then initiation is like somebody plucked you off the vine and they did this to you, (laughter) and your dry spells has got to do with all this stuff here. Periodically they&rsquo;ll put this in the jar and it starts the fermentation, it&rsquo;s gonna be very tricky job too because it can be wine or vinegar, but we can&rsquo;t stop at the wine because that would be a psychic level of our growth. It&rsquo;s good, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that is called gift of Spirit but it&rsquo;s not fruit of Spirit. It is the next stage, the enhancing where Satsang is. You meet the person or they&rsquo;re not even there, the Satsang doesn&rsquo;t stop, the Satsang is going on now at a cellular level inside with eyes open or eyes shut. The verbal dialogue can be suspended now at your command, this is shifting into the champagne level. Therefore they call that Samadhi or God-realization in the waking state, the moving state, that&rsquo;s the champagne state. Wine is the non-moving state where you sit down like this and you&rsquo;re drunk with it but the moment you get up, it&rsquo;s all gone, you rush back, that&rsquo;s the wine state. So you&rsquo;re afraid to get up and move around lest the verbalizations keep rushing back in and the peace seems to get weaker but don&rsquo;t quit, just go again. And it&rsquo;s being reinforced by those who love you as in the Eye of the Cyclone written by Dr. Lilly, you&rsquo;re not without others looking on who are deeply concerned with your well-being no matter what level you&rsquo;re at, that&rsquo;s nice to know. But no matter what level you think you&rsquo;re in, there&rsquo;s always somebody watching to pull you back up and that&rsquo;s good to know that we never really can fall short of the Creative Presence. So out of sight is not out of mind, you&rsquo;re always in tune with the individual and it pulls you up so you can move from the wine stage or the non-moving stage to the champagne stage, the ever-moving stage, that&rsquo;s the purpose behind it to get you there to be your own bottle of champagne and flip out your own cork (laughter). And Darshan or Satsang is that intent, that&rsquo;s the whole intent behind it, the whole mechanics behind it is to get you the initiated grape to move on into the champagne level of yourself. That&rsquo;s the students went to Jesus and he said &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t touch your feet, you&rsquo;re not in me.&rdquo; If I don&rsquo;t make contact with you or if you don&rsquo;t see or relate or get together, there is no enhancing of (inaudible). See that&rsquo;s how for centuries Man realized that a Satsang or a group sitting down was more important than books. Books are good but books don&rsquo;t give you the level of non-verbalization, you have to sit down in the presence with loved ones and activate the memory that triggered you in the first place to be interested in yourself and feel that vibrancy permeate you and suspend the verbalization and that allows you to extend that nonverbal quality longer and longer to the extent that you can get up and walk with it. Another quality of Satsang, which is fellowship or two or three gatherings in my Name, is the exposure to transfiguration. When the disciples were with their teacher Jesus in the Garden and he asked them to pray a while with him which means to sit down and suspend the verbalization, later on one said that they saw two other great Souls standing next to the teacher: Moses and Elijah and one brave soul said, Peter, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a tabernacle or a covenant,&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll make a commitment at this point in time in our own nature to really try to suspend the verbalization so that we can have more of this exposure to the transfiguration. Transfiguration is both visual and internal, biological. You may see facial changes on the person, interposing phases of the unity of the atom and the oneness of life at the visual level. That&rsquo;s just the skin of the banana, the real banana you want to eat now let alone get the oil, comes from inside. The real eternal transfiguration is the closing of the eyes and at the portal door where all of us merge, we come through embracing you from inside then you are transfigured. 0:30 And they have only one message for you, &ldquo;We who have crossed the threshold of silence yearn for you to cross that threshold and to merge in the unity of yourself and may you be transfigured into your eternal Now. Then a strange thing will happen, when you open the eyes to look out you may not see anything for a few seconds and you&rsquo;ll wonder where you are, don&rsquo;t get scared. Having crossed the threshold of silence, you&rsquo;ve crossed the threshold of Sonics which means the Father outside of the vibratory creation. The Father as a Son, He&rsquo;s His own Son, is the Creative Intelligence in the vibratory creation of sonics, &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father but I go unto the Father,&rdquo; that came later. The realized Man goes on to the next level, he has to go on to the next level but he must experience the first level of hearing the Sonics, having an outward exposure to the transfiguring experience of physical laws, things seem to go hazy, it&rsquo;s like looking down the road on a hot day. Don&rsquo;t get scared, it&rsquo;s just natural laws going on, you&rsquo;re not hallucinating and it&rsquo;s occurring naturally within you, it&rsquo;s allowing you to have total sight into the reality. Then you&rsquo;ll cross that threshold where there is no verbalization, there is no matching, there is no language in it. For that brief moment you have crossed through there, you are with the Father then you know for sure without doubt, He became (inaudible). Ego, individuality are all left behind in the Sonic level, in the verbalization level and a collective unity of oneness is very very pronounced in your mechanism. So I can appreciate your feeling when you said &ldquo;you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;re gonna (inaudible)&rdquo; that was because you were feeling it at a sonic level in the engulfment with the water because in a strange way you survived, that intimacy of compassion plucked you to the next level and from now on you can cross the threshold and go into your Divinity. Do not be afraid of your divinity and you may admit like Saint Catherine, &ldquo;Give me back my brother Jesus&rdquo; because she sees her own self, she prefers to have someone to respect, we all do that. I myself looks to Yogananda or living teachers because one cannot really worship a total non-image even though it became you. It would be a sense of non-appreciation for those who went before you who made you conscious but whatever time they triggered that consciousness in you to recognize it. So you are no longer afraid or feel threatened by paying respect or loving adoration to the person who triggered you. That&rsquo;s how they wrote the book later on &ldquo;At the Feet of the Master&rdquo; but you don&rsquo;t see his face, you just see the foot and many Gurus have the name &ldquo;foot of God.&rdquo; A lot of these highly realized Masters, when you translate their name it&rsquo;s called paw or foot of God or the toe of God and it&rsquo;s very interesting the names that they have. It&rsquo;s no discredit to any of us, it&rsquo;s so fantastically loving, you just love it. Everyone is. If you feel to close your eyes and merge do so, if you feel to keep your eyes open do so, let presence flow. Fill yourself with presence, let your potential come to the surface, you&rsquo;re aiming for champagne. (Gap in tape). Audience: I want to hear your exposition on the enlightenment of the unmarried person, the everyday person. Adano: We use the word enlightenment but sometimes we really don&rsquo;t connect the experience, what it represents in terms of the spiritual life. In the spiritual life the enlightenment is the ability to recognize moment to moment the intrinsic timing of events occurring around you. How you as an individual is at a certain location, a certain time, and your reaction to the conditions based upon your expectancy. In the olden days they would say every action is determined by God, His will be done, but we never really can cope with it or get any experience to say that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will and if we fail we do say it&rsquo;s His will and if we win we do say it&rsquo;s His will but we never really understand what is His will in the first place in terms of the practical exposure, practical day-to-day living. So we tend to search for enlightenment as if it is going to totally eradicate all the veils of the existence. The enlightenment in the daily life and for the human being more than the ordinary  man or woman, the human being per say, in the true spiritualness is recognition of timing. Many of you drove a lot of vehicles to come here, right? Did you buy sixty five hundred dollars worth of parts or sixty five hundred dollars worth of timing? Yet in a simple rational practical existence, it&rsquo;s taken for granted until it&rsquo;s brought into focus what you really have and what you&rsquo;re really experiencing and what frees you now from guilt complex. Spirituality aims to free you from guilt in the experience and aims to let you have the enlightenment or the understanding to be correct that doesn&rsquo;t have a feedback of guilt because there is no good or bad. 0:40 Like Omar Khayyam would say &ldquo;I myself am heaven and hell&rdquo; but heaven in the sense of a haven or reservoir, hell in the sense of &ldquo;h-e-l-d,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m held back by my own inability to time myself. Nobody is holding me back, I am holding my one-self back and that is because I&rsquo;m out of time and if we look at production and production simply represents repetition, you can say &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; now, mechanical rosary, repeating over and over, Xeroxing, do you see? You&rsquo;re getting the understanding, you&rsquo;re getting the enlightenment then you&rsquo;re again recognizing that you&rsquo;re forced to synchronize with timing. That automatically liberates you from a guilt process of living that drains you off and then you feel left out and in actuality it&rsquo;s not true. The enlightenment or the freedom from, that&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;free men all, lord of yourself&rdquo; but s-e-l-f can be very misleading and can be very nebulous and very authoritative and very deistic whereas c-e-l-l, &ldquo;free men all, lord of the cell,&rdquo; lord of these cells. This is an intrinsic battery, each one of them, it&rsquo;s an intrinsic machinery, it&rsquo;s an intrinsic powerhouse, it&rsquo;s a conditioned atom. You as consciousness is in-resident in it and the interconnectedness of timing makes you more appreciative of it therefore freeing you of the guilt feedbacks as you become synchronized to its internal rhythms. The whole frontier of reality opens itself for you now in the unlimitedness of it that there is no limitation to God, it is called to the greater glory of God. To this end Jesus healed the blind man, not because of karma if he from a past life that he is born blind or the parents which is heredity but it&rsquo;s the challenge within each one of us to pull it together in the cellular structure and realize or feel and time yourself, lock into your intrinsic timing now recognized as the true will of God. Why would the Creator create to punish? He doesn&rsquo;t punish, He provides one basic law for the whole creation to function on, we know as Newton&rsquo;s first law, right? In the East we know it as karma and to the churchianistic thinking it is &ldquo;what you sow, you reap,&rdquo; and the cowboys are singing it now, (inaudible) but karma or whatever you want to call it is still centered on timing. If you look at it objectively and don&rsquo;t be swayed by its forcefulness on you, you will free the brain from the feedback of guilt and look at it as the opportunity to rise above your limitations and that is really the full enlightenment of the human being. &ldquo;To him that overcometh,&rdquo; I will do what? &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t send forth a second time.&rdquo; You see all these things are coming to have more valid meaning and possible experience. Before it would seem nebulous not when you look at it in terms of timing and when you have to live a day-to-day life of basic survival regardless of what you believe in and when the cost factor of existence tells you where it&rsquo;s at, put up or shut up, then you know timing is God&rsquo;s will in your life like it or not. It doesn&rsquo;t take away from the old traditional way of describing the sacredness of God to you, in fact it removes the weakness of it with your own self-fear of integrating with it and it imparts a strength which you never had before and that&rsquo;s the strength of peace. &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give,&rdquo; the peace that comes from within your own I AM-ness of understanding your structure. This is strength, you can live it and not feel threatened by it and to sum it up in a working behavior of enlightenment or understanding, it is acting what you say to yourself. Years ago when I came into this area and I happened to go on the reservation and I grew up hearing this statement many times when they said that the Indians accused the white man of speaking with a forked tongue and I always wanted to know what that really meant and I have a friend who I&rsquo;m going to see pretty soon and he said &ldquo;pale face speak with forked tongue.&rdquo; And I looked at my tongue in the mirror and I couldn&rsquo;t see where it was forked and then try to get their version, &ldquo;he lies, he doesn&rsquo;t convey what he means&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not really what it was. The Indian on the reservation today or in the frontier days realized that in their structural language, it was designed to act what they say. Whereas in english it&rsquo;s not so designed, one word has many different meanings and this creates a conflict when spoken to another person who is linearly conditioned to act out what he says and doesn&rsquo;t have flexibility. Then he will accuse you for being double talking and meaning different shades of the meaning and therefore you can get into all kind of wrong understandings in communication. Yet by the same token, rigid language, linear in itself can be a prison and a flexible language can be a treasure. You can restrict yourself in one word with one meaning and at the same time you can liberate yourself with that same word by having a different meaning especially if you&rsquo;re traumatized, I&rsquo;ll give you an example. For the actual layman, as you would say, looking for enlightenment moment to moment, d-o-g, now you must be thankful to english the only language you can do this with, d-o-g is man&rsquo;s best friend, agreed? You spell it backwards it&rsquo;s still the man&rsquo;s best friend. (Laughter). 0:50 Now you can&rsquo;t do that with any other language no matter how you try so we have a unique experience here by speaking english. Many nationalities can use for the first time a guilt-free communication to their internal self, it&rsquo;s very very interesting because you don&rsquo;t feel threatened no more as you begin to look at the simplicity and the naturalness of the language and the timing of the events. Years ago, I&rsquo;ll give you an example in my own life, I&rsquo;d an appointment to go to and I&rsquo;d always think I would be late so I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get there before and I&rsquo;d get worked up with the feeling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late, I don&rsquo;t want to get late.&rdquo; So you burn up so much energy worrying about being late by the time you get there, all the red lights are in your favor. (Laughter). So one day I said to myself, &ldquo;enough of this wanting to be late, why can&rsquo;t the other guy be late and I be early? Why should I think that I&rsquo;m going to be late, can he not be late?&rdquo; I reversed the mental attitude, not feeling guilt or wishing him any kind of a bad accident or anything and so for the first time when I saw it work, I laughed, I arrived at my destination all green lights and he&rsquo;s busy apologizing for the red lights. (Laughter). Audience: I understand the timing with regards to outside events but how can we become conscious of the timing of our own selves? Adano: Time is a word that will make a lot of us think it does not exist since it&rsquo;s being conscious of where you are and you have to use your cells by breathing to be self-conscious and therefore you could say to yourself you have all the time in the world because all time is really Now and there is really no yesterday and there is really no tomorrow. Whatever occurred yesterday occurred in the Now of yesterday. Whatever will occur tomorrow will be in the Now of tomorrow when it occurs. So we can go around in circles talking to ourselves from within but eventually you will find that you will verbally zero in on the internal atomic light of the cell and then you would have a true picture of timing in the cellular structure. The distance light crosses the width of an electron is a unit of time in the cell. You are an atom conditioned onto a cellular form, you carry a tremendous power within you, the capacity to monitor called consciousness. Yet the only way you can validate it is to look inward and that&rsquo;s the direction every teacher gives, &ldquo;When the eyes,&rdquo; not one, he said both, &ldquo;are single,&rdquo; now how could you make two eyes single? Try as you like, looking outside it could never be single, it would be distorting all around. The only way it could singularly focus or singularly refer itself to or center itself, you have to close then you have a single vision and then closed vision. &ldquo;When the eyes are single, the whole body,&rdquo; now this is more scientific now, it&rsquo;s getting more scientific, no reference to any object outside the whole body, the whole cellular mechanism, &ldquo;IS,&rdquo; not was, IS &ldquo;full,&rdquo; capacity, &ldquo;of light.&rdquo; Now imagine a cellular mechanism being monitored by its own cell capabilities, the maximum light potential locked up in it and to zero in on specific measurements, each cell, each unit would involve light. And therefore a unit of time, if you&rsquo;re going to say time means an emission of this, that&rsquo;s time spelled backward, &ldquo;e-m-i-t,&rdquo; because this is really an emission mechanism and what is an emission, it&rsquo;s an energy field. As we get more specific, more objective and intrinsic, it has to go across certain dimensions and so to put it in a unit measurement to make it repetitious to be practical to survive, we will eventually recognize that this timing is propelling itself from within the atomic structure and therefore the distance it will travel across the width of the electron would give you your unit of timing inside of you. &ldquo;The light is shining in the darkness,&rdquo; here you become trapped now for the first time because when you look inside you see darkness and yet if you remember when you were initiated you saw a light within you, right? &ldquo;And the light is shining in the darkness but the darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; the very cell that is circular, that contains light, sets of a force field of darkness to compress the light, keeping the light in a state of &ldquo;capsuled down.&rdquo; The more you verbalize, the more the light disappears because you&rsquo;re putting up a shield in front of it. The less you&rsquo;ve verbalize, which is called the internal dialogue, the less you want to match words or your programming from the environment, the more the light seems to expand. &ldquo;Let your light so shine,&rdquo; that means diminish the verbalization in order for the force field of light to fill out and take over and push away the darkness. Before who? &ldquo;Let your light so shine before who?&rdquo; It only says Man, your fellow Man. &ldquo;That they may see the good works and glorify the Father which is in you.&rdquo; Others will feel or sense or actually see by the eyes when it&rsquo;s open this glow of total vision and they will sense a synchronicity with you. 1:00 From that moment on, whatever you put in the brain as a program like a computer, it punches up. Now picture for one moment you&rsquo;re in the place of the mind of Jesus, as Paul says &ldquo;Give me that mind that was in Christ&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re sitting there and somebody says to you &ldquo;Lazarus is dead&rdquo; and if you don&rsquo;t have any comprehension of what you are intrinsically, you may not be able to say &ldquo;Lazarus come forth.&rdquo; Now imagine when you said &ldquo;Lazarus come forth,&rdquo; out of the grave says &ldquo;No boss, I ain&rsquo;t getting up for you.&rdquo; That blows away all your realization about yourself but if the mechanism of Lazarus gets up and comes out and then you the person who is applying the law would suddenly say &ldquo;Father, I didn&rsquo;t have to say it in a loud voice, only because of the people around.&rdquo; Light, sonics, timing, rhythm. Now this phenomenon is not restricted only to the man Jesus because he was the very first man to say &ldquo;The things I do, you will do also and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; That lays the groundwork for greater things for him to experience too but if he says &ldquo;Not greater than me&rdquo; and &ldquo;no further than this,&rdquo; then you know where you are and you know who he is. But the principle doesn&rsquo;t do that in the mechanism, the principle is giving you greater and greater possibilities of yourself which then makes you more conscious of the internal cellular timing to the demand and you can&rsquo;t express it before the demand is there. You couldn&rsquo;t command the force to move if there is no demand. Who would fill a full cup, you see what I mean? So you couldn&rsquo;t express any motion on your part if there is no demand for it, the timing is always evidence of the demand and your ability to synchronize to fit the demand. So again no-thing moves except by Divine Will, there is no object moving in proper synchronicity if it wants to perform efficiently. If it doesn&rsquo;t want to perform efficiently it would be out of what? Synchronicity. Everything to perform efficiently must be in its state of synchronicity, this is Divine Will, nothing moves except by Divine Will. It&rsquo;s another way of saying no physical function or cosmic function or intrinsic function is occurring without synchronicity. So don&rsquo;t feel that timing, though reduced to represent Divine Will, is a mundane thing, it&rsquo;s not a mundane thing, it&rsquo;s a very sacred thing so sacred that you don&rsquo;t violate or try to push it. You know what they say &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t break a law of nature, you break yourself against it&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s how we learn the hard way. It that clear enough? Audience: So guessing that timing that is proper is more or less anticipating the events that are going to happen? Adano: I&rsquo;ll have to quote Sri Yukteswar, &ldquo;God is un-anticipatory, ever-new joy&rdquo; and though we may foretell our future conditions, it doesn&rsquo;t compel us to experience it. Therefore the stars may foretell but they don&rsquo;t compel and by this we learn now the deeper impact of timing on our lives, we have a freedom in timing. We don&rsquo;t exercise it because we don&rsquo;t know how to exercise it and the only time we can exercise this freedom is in a necessity. That&rsquo;s why the scriptural writings that the Eastern teachers would say &ldquo;All your needs are fulfilled,&rdquo; they didn&rsquo;t say all your wants are fulfilled. So life as a functional process is a necessity motivated synchronous organism comprising your cellular structure as the ultimate form of experience, do you get it now? That&rsquo;s why God cannot be competed with, He&rsquo;s unique in the sense that he became you but He will permit you and I and everyone in this room to have more and more of the potential to bring to the surface, we&rsquo;ll never run out of our potential. Audience: Then why is it that everybody isn&rsquo;t just absolutely frantic to find out how to do this? Adano: (Laughter). Some of us are like chicken eggs, some of us are like turtle eggs, some of us are like dinosaur eggs. Chicken eggs take 21 days to hatch, turtle eggs may take 90 days to hatch, and dinosaur eggs take 1000 years to hatch. (Laughter). It&rsquo;s the degree of toxicity to which each one of us are being exposed to that delays the synchronicity or recognition of it. So cleanliness is next to Godliness was a statement made, I just twisted a little to say &ldquo;Cleanliness IS Godliness,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not next to, it is. Because the more you clean up your mechanism, the more you synchronize with the Creative Principle and the obvious experience is no longer miraculous, it&rsquo;s the end result of everything falling into place for the first time which you should have done in the first place before you ever got toxic, you see? And we were non-toxic when we came into existence but we went off and then we lost our synchronicity so we come back to this by opportunity to repeat it. Nature provides the laws for its creation to go through. Audience: How long does it take? Are you suggesting a diet to cleanse? Adano: That&rsquo;s only one of the means of detoxifying the body, that&rsquo;s only one of the means. Even if you follow diet, remember you have to think first to eat incorrectly let alone to think to eat correctly. So again attitude comes back in terms of the action and cleaning up again you&rsquo;re not only going to clean up the physical action, you&rsquo;re going to clean up the thinking process too then you&rsquo;re going to try and look at the objective results. So it&rsquo;s not just something you&rsquo;re going to allow yourself to be subjected to and can&rsquo;t do anything, you have a way now to change the mental attitude, change the input or the output, and gradually bring it back into alignment. 1:10 The same way like a car, if we put so much trust in a vehicle to take us down the road with our lives at stake, like I flew in a plane today and I&rsquo;m looking at the metal there and I&rsquo;m thinking of the many brains that went to put this whole piece of machinery together and the whole conversation was chronicity or timing for each of these gadget to stay stable for the thing to fly but that isn&rsquo;t obvious until you relate. What is so obvious is the rotating of the fan and the seats all these things are obvious, the most important thing that should be obvious you don&rsquo;t see it but if one of those pieces of equipment be off time, what do we got? A nosedive, you see. So this if in a physical way is obvious to us then attitudinally, program-wise to the way we speak to ourselves is far more important to the realization of ourselves. All great teachers will tell you the same thing in their own way but when you break it down into a practical application and that&rsquo;s what you want now. We don&rsquo;t want to remain like children in kindergarten and not apply the law of life in practical ways otherwise we&rsquo;d be hurting ourselves and condemning one another and becoming very fanatical and in the end we&rsquo;ve missed the boat. It&rsquo;s when we start working with it and getting to the practical level of it, we start to see the commonality then we can go on without feeling guilty or threatened by the environment. The environment is here before us to offer us the opportunity to synchronize for the highest good but we can interfere or block that synchronicity by the attitude. That&rsquo;s how come one great man wrote this book called &ldquo;Positive Thinking&rdquo; but the thinking is the attitude necessary for the action and you have to think that you act and if you think and have to act then what is the basis of it? It&rsquo;s the rhythm or the synchronicity. Now you&rsquo;re a musician? Good. If you have four people playing with you and everyone plays in their own way, are you gonna have any music coming out? See what I mean? The same thing applies, we use the word spirituality, it&rsquo;s just another way of saying the spiraling force field of the cells and how to synchronize with that which is your DNA and RNA. They&rsquo;re set up like a helix inside of you so more and more our research world and its results are making us conscious minus guilt as the reality of our true spiritual nature. Not churchianistic or overly religious, no, those terms can put you in the wrong frame of experience. The spiritual person, I don&rsquo;t know if you all saw the picture of Gandhi, you know what he said? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hindu, I&rsquo;m a Jew, I&rsquo;m a Christian, above all I&rsquo;m a human being.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s more important, the emphasis on being. He didn&rsquo;t aspire to have any great qualities, he just wanted to live what is factually now and work with the timing of the period and spirituality is that. It&rsquo;s showing up all around us in many ways through the movies, through the different art forms that we didn&rsquo;t recognize before, now we are starting to relate and recognize it. It is becoming more and more obvious that all of us are good, don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. Remember one thing, you&rsquo;re born a winner, it could be worse. (Laughter). Audience: Now we&rsquo;re all going around detoxifying and trying to get synchronized and I&rsquo;ve read certain people or their vibrational patterns you come in contact with them, you&rsquo;ll pick up their patterns and so some Masters would say don&rsquo;t shake hands with anybody, don&rsquo;t touch anybody because you&rsquo;ll pick up their vibrations. I don&rsquo;t understand, what should we do? Adano: Yes, no, maybe. You see when you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, don&rsquo;t touch. It&rsquo;s like a child, he don&rsquo;t know a hot cup will burn their hands so you tell them don&rsquo;t touch but they&rsquo;ll push to find out and then scald themselves. And when you know what you&rsquo;re doing, you pick up a rag and take the cup off the stove and you don&rsquo;t burn your hands and maybe if you&rsquo;re pouring a hot stuff into the cup that is cold then you don&rsquo;t burn your hands either. It&rsquo;s a matter of knowing. It would be highly impractical to say don&rsquo;t touch anyone. If a person is dying there and another person comes along and says &ldquo;Oh boy, you&rsquo;re not Jewish like me or you&rsquo;re not Chinese like me, I can&rsquo;t touch you. You&rsquo;re not rich like me, I can&rsquo;t touch you.&rdquo; And another person walks in the room and says &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;d better call an ambulance and do something&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the story of the good Samaritan. It&rsquo;s to make you realize that we can carry the idea out of scope in terms of what is practical and human and what is more important is not that the person may be bad or they may not be the same peer group or rich like you, is that it&rsquo;s a human being and don&rsquo;t judge them from karma and don&rsquo;t judge them from heredity. Always look at them at the higher potential of God in them because that may be God&rsquo;s way to test you if you believe in a higher potential in your own self and the more humanistic you can generate contact, the more compassionate this force field will shoot up like a champagne out of you. But it needs that kind of a confrontation to trigger that&hellip; (gap in tape). Would you say the man who has to handle a deceased corpse is going to worry? Put on a pair of gloves and pack it away and when you look at your loved one that has passed away, when he was up and walking around you hug him. When he&rsquo;s lying there in a coffin, flat on his back for a long time and you&rsquo;re not going to (inaudible). It&rsquo;s comical you know, you can get locked into a lot of things, the most important thing is the heart. You see in my work I have to work with all kinds of sick people and I heard that before I ever got into therapy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch this person, don&rsquo;t touch that person&rdquo; and when you get into therapy, you don&rsquo;t have time to think that because the person may be going from good to worse as far as their health is concerned and you know it doesn&rsquo;t take long for them to stop breathing. If you can&rsquo;t help them to hold on to that breath and get some sense of focus simply because you don&rsquo;t want to touch them, it&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s very frustrating that you find yourself in a helpless state like that when you feel that you couldn&rsquo;t reach out and touch, even to just console the person in some way. A gesture or kindness could be all they needed to pull them out of it and that&rsquo;s why they say the good Samaritan story is a very good way to solve the feeling of touch or don&rsquo;t touch. 1:20 Why I point out that is there&rsquo;s a a story that goes like this, it has to do with devotion and touching is a devotional concept. There was a man who traveled from the States to India after World War 2 was over and he read a book on the Eastern teachings and he wanted to go and meet some living person who could tell him about these spiritual laws that are written about. And he respected the author because author happened to be a neighborhood friend of his in the same town he was born in, went to the same school but they never saw each other in India and so the author mentions these people in the East. So this man goes all the way to the East and travels from place to place and finally he arrives at a place they call an ashram or community and he meets a living teacher there, someone who&rsquo;s living there and talking about spiritual subjects. There was no difference about him, he was just ordinary dressed and he stayed there for a while and got initiated into the art of meditation then he left and came back to America. When he got home, this is what he told his wife, he said &ldquo;Honey I&rsquo;m a different man now. I no longer eat the meat and I no longer drink alcohol and I need time off to be silent in myself and I don&rsquo;t smoke no more.&rdquo; She looked at them and she said &ldquo;Honey don&rsquo;t make me into you, I like my nip, I like my little meat, I like my little cigarette. I&rsquo;ll cook your food in a clean pot, plate, and everything, everything will be meticulous, and nothing will have anything to do with mine&rdquo; and that was the agreement &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me into you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;daisy don&rsquo;t convert me into a rose.&rdquo; All right, this went on for many years and they lived happily together and one day the teacher came for a visit to this country and he invites the teacher to their home and he told the teacher what a great wife he has, that she would cook food for him without any meat or anything. The teacher said all right and they went to the house and it was lunchtime and they got to the table and there was the wife, cooked the food and their food was separate food and the teacher looked at her straight like that and as he sat down he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll initiate you.&rdquo; Now that blew this man&rsquo;s whole entire mind, here he for years been&hellip; and when he went to India he had to clean up his act and clean up his body before he could get initiated, be a vegetarian to some extent, and here she&rsquo;s been eating and nipping, puffing, and she&rsquo;s gonna be initiated right away. Well he did like that and he said the teacher waved his hand in front of her face and (inaudible), she had a double shot of champagne and she&rsquo;s gone flying and she&rsquo;s seeing all kind of colors and feeling wonderful experiences of joy. That evening the teacher is ready to retire and so his friend said &ldquo;Sir, can I ask you one question before you retire?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;How come you initiated her just like that right away, never seeing her, and me all the time in India back and forth over the years?&rdquo; Then the teacher said to him, these are the words he said, &ldquo;Your devotion is a devotion of the brain. Her devotion is a devotion of the heart.&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t say a devotion to what, it left the man to figure out what the teacher meant. &ldquo;Your devotion is a devotion of the brain. Her devotion is a devotion of the heart&rdquo; and then he tells me later on what the teacher meant, &ldquo;A devotion of the brain is I&rsquo;m too busy worrying what I should and what I should not do to please my teacher in order to live a spiritual life. Whereas my wife simply cooked the food and you&rsquo;re my husband and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo; (Inaudible), she&rsquo;s not going to offend her husband, he wants to eat no meat and don&rsquo;t drink no alcohol and no smoke so she just did it and that was doing it from her heart as a wife. She wasn&rsquo;t arguing questions why she should or should not, her devotion was simply doing the thing as she was asked. And he said then he realized now why when the teacher arrived and saw the two of them, who was really having the internal growth. So don&rsquo;t make your devotion one of the brain, to touch or not to touch, make it from the heart. That&rsquo;s where you come back again, &ldquo;The pure in heart sees God&rdquo; not the pure in brain sees God. (Laughter). You see the ancient people were very specific in their anatomy and their feelings in the anatomy because your brain will constantly analyze left and right side, what and why. The heart doesn&rsquo;t have that to do, it just does but it has a compensation, the brain has a compensation too in the analysis, it&rsquo;s not easily fooled. Therefore when the heart takes over after it&rsquo;s been convinced there&rsquo;s no shenanigans going on in the brain then the heart takes over. Whereas the other way the heart can be fooled but even so the heart will override its being self-fooled. That&rsquo;s a wonderful part of the heart, it can override its own self fooling, the brain cannot do that, it needs the heart to do that because once you&rsquo;re being fooled with your brain, you don&rsquo;t trust it no more, it takes a long time to generate the compassion but if you&rsquo;re fooled from the heart, you still will push again to ride above it and come out. The heart is designed to do that, to rise above a self betrayal more than the brain. It&rsquo;s the reservoir of the compassion. Audience: Can you say a few words about attitude since that story seems to be in some way also about attitude but what attitude should we try to develop or which ones do we have to be afraid or be careful of? Adano: Over monitoring yourself too much, that&rsquo;s the attitude you have to avoid, making it too much of a brain issue of doing things that are functional and rational to be practical about your spiritual nature. Your spiritual nature isn&rsquo;t something that you&rsquo;re trying to put on a shelf as a polished object, spiritual nature is a process of living moment to moment as practical as possible. Therefore you don&rsquo;t sum up or assess a true spiritual person by their miraculous abilities or their possessions or their logistical communication, you judge them from their ability to be practical in any situation, that&rsquo;s how you judge it. Their sense of practicality under every circumstance or situation that comes up and how simple and practical they can be at the same time, that&rsquo;s the real attitude you should be focused on, to keep it as simple and practical. The reason is that every law in nature after you start analyzing it and working with it, you see how simple it is, you just couldn&rsquo;t realize how you missed it and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking at and you&rsquo;re trying to maintain that. As one teacher told his student &ldquo;I rather you read a hundred books, investigate all there is, talk with all the people in the world before you attempt to sit down for 10 minutes to meditate&rdquo; because what you would do in the 10 minutes is so simple, you&rsquo;re not going to believe that&rsquo;s what you have to do. So he says &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you take all your time, go all the truth, and then when you&rsquo;re satisfied that it&rsquo;s a non-verbal experience, then you&rsquo;ll sit down and watch inside.&rdquo; 1:30 That&rsquo;s how come they use the term Jehovah Witness consciousness is witnessing life in motion in the organism and doesn&rsquo;t interfere or try to monitor it or try to direct it, it merely learns to recognize its rhythms and in the recognition of its rhythms, it will begin to experience the timing or what you say Divine Will, it will get up to move with it. That is exactly why they say the dance of life because once you sit down and you watch internally, you hear the internal music and music is the food&hellip; sonics, cellular sonics, feeds consciousness which is the food of the Soul. Consciousness must talk, that&rsquo;s language, it must resonate in order to be respected and it&rsquo;s a hard thing to admit that your big fat mouth is important among people. To remain silent is not so often looked upon as&hellip; and yet it&rsquo;s powerful enough to make people respect you when you don&rsquo;t talk but this sonics goes on in you and your consciousness is watching this internal rhythm, this constriction, this dilation that&rsquo;s occurring in you from breathing as you watch it. Then eventually there is no more right brain/left brain arguments, it&rsquo;s a witnessing and it&rsquo;s a synchronicity but it doesn&rsquo;t remain there. That&rsquo;s just like the grape being picked and squashed, it has to move on to the next level of wine fermenting and then fermenting to a higher quality like champagne. So sitting there and looking is not the end of it, you may suddenly get glimpses and you think you&rsquo;re psychic. Well you&rsquo;re entitled to that because that&rsquo;s the next level up but don&rsquo;t be trapped in it because Paul will tell you those are only the gifts of the Spirit, that&rsquo;s not the actual fruit of the Spirit yet. That can leave you, a blow on the head and you lose all your psychic capability but you&rsquo;re still going to be a humble person with a blow on your head or be egotistical about being hit on the head. So keep on watching inside and then the watching begins to recognize outward synchronicity which is timing which is learning to fit, everything falls into place. You move into the final stage and that&rsquo;s what they call the wisdom or understanding is the fruit of the Spirit. You understand now that this mechanism is unique and designed to exonerate you from all your guilt and express total compassion by timing which is God-realization. Any other question? Audience: Why is sitting in a fairly static position so important, sitting meditation? Adano: Well if you disengage from the beta level of your brain by looking inside when you&rsquo;re standing up, you&rsquo;re liable to fall over and hit your head and if you&rsquo;re lying flat on your back and you disengage somebody may walk in and think you&rsquo;re dead but if you&rsquo;re sitting there, they may say &ldquo;Oh, he might be snoozing or he may be practicing his weird techniques.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adano83_07_27FlagstaffQandAQ2NW3 -</p>
<p>Adano83_07_28_1FlagstaffSpiritualLifeQ2NW3 - At end of tape&hellip; Blood type explanation.</p>
<p>Adano83_07_28_2FlagstaffMemoryQ2NW3 - &ldquo;Death Experience&rdquo; as told at lecture on &ldquo;The Physiological, Psychological, and Spiritual Aspects / Dimensions of Memory&rdquo; at the home of Vasant Merchant. 1:45 The realized person has the total spectrum working for the first time in him. He has the total memory. So he not only sees, but he hears and feels and smells and can taste. That’s why you have to first put yourself in order. It’s like a doctor. He can’t be a doctor if he don’t take his training course. 1:46 Again, at certain age levels, the full spectrum opens up. Full spectrum awareness occurs between 30-35, in the first phase of a person’s evolution. Now if he doesn’t accomplish it between 30-35, the second phase of full spectrum consciousness is 45-65. Now if he doesn’t accomplish it between that second phase, then he’s got one more opportunity 80- 100 on. That’s why some records show individuals to have a late illumination in that awareness and others to have an early illumination and the majority falls in the middle. Now, it depends on how old you are now and trying to shift over. It’s like trying to say to yourself, “I just got pregnant today and I want the baby tomorrow.” You personally have to go through certain psycho physiological changing and cleansing routines on your own mechanism to evaluate and let it occur. So it’s not something we can push. It is something you have to let mature within, but you will get it. It is there for you. You may not know at which one of the three levels you are in for it to mature out. So don’t let that bother you. All you have to do is go on in and it will come out. 2:00 The universe is for Love, but not to be in love with it because the moment you say you are in love with it, you program out of love and you are going to fall out. You have incidents to go in and out of it, but if you say Love and you feel it, this is what they say the compassionate nature starts to emerge out of your memory banks. Creative life is creative Love, already locked up in you and all the Loved Ones that have gone ahead. They have so loved the world that they enter into it. When you read the statement “God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son” meaning that Consciousness, out of creativeness loves Its manifestation that It will constantly merge Itself into Its manifestation for the benefit of Its manifestation. So you begin to realize what a fantastic process of God’s Love is embodied already coming in. You can’t evade it no more. It’s not a mind thing no more, it’s not a brain, it’s heart. The heart begins to pulsate for the first time.</p>

<p>Adano86_03_28_3LivingtoLiveQ2NW3 - 0:13 All around us, we think we are seeing living people, but really, 99% of the time, people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they are 60 years of age and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically, but if they are living to live, they have this tremendous power available to them to be in the world yet not of the whirl, to be seen and not to be seen. 0:40 The most important thing in this journey of now, since it is not going anyplace, it’s called the Journey of Now. NOW. And it sounds like a journey which implies going someplace, but you’re not going anyplace. It’s a journey of coping, more than going. It’s a big difference between looking at it as a journey of going someplace, from one place to another place. It’s occurring in Now. A journey of coping in the Now and since Now and coping are all contained by the Creative Me, that’s why Moses had to confront it, “there is no god before Me,” and don’t have no graven image. Don’t look for any object outside of yourself that’s going to represent me. Me is already locked up here. 0:51 I’ll give you an example of an illusion and the actual truth. There was a priest who lived in a town and a big rain came and it started to flood the area. So the priest began to pray to God to stop the rain. Got out there, praying, and the water came up to his knee and all the parishishioners in the town saw him there praying and they came along with the boat and said, “Father, please save yourself. Come on, get in this boat and let’s go to the highland for refuge.” And he says, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go save anyone you find that needs help, take them to safety.” He kept on praying and the water got up to his chest. By that time a second boat came along and the people said, “Oh Father, please save yourself.” He said, “No, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go and find people that you can save and take them to the higher ground.” They went off. By that time the water got as high as his nose now. Along came a helicopter with a ladder and said, “Hey Father, please save yourself, grab the ladder, the place is all flooded.” And he shouted, “No, no, I am praying to God to stop the rain. You go ahead and try and save anyone that you can take them to higher ground. I am praying to God to stop the rain.” Finally, the water is over his head and he is standing before God and he says, “How come I’m here? I thought you would stop the rain?” And God said, “Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more do you want?” You see what belief can do in that fixated state versus when the practical is all around you for you to function. And that’s the problem is happening to many of us today, that we get so over fixated in the belief and when the practical thing is there, we miss the truth. Not that a miracle cannot happen to pray for the rain to stop, with God anything is possible, but I don’t think God is constantly manufacturing miracles because somebody get down on his knees and prays for it. When all the other varieties of ways for man’s survival and continuance is available to him. He’s just got to open his consciousness and recognize the many other opportunities that are there for his survival. This is what we are calling “Living to Live” instead of living to die. Living to die is a fixated state. Living to live is not. All the great men who have come down throughout the centuries all came to teach us to live to live. FROM MARJORIE MORGAN NOTES: Yes it is very auspicious tonight the whole week has been so miraculous, so unusual, (Easter week). On the way down here I was looking for a present for my associate in Texas, trying to get a birthday present for the person. I coudn&rsquo;t decide what to buy the person. We stopped at different places and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re coming along outside Gila Bend, I said to my friend who was driving, &ldquo;stop the van, stop right here, your going to get gas.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;no, the gas station if further down.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;no, the gas station is right here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop, stop,,&rdquo; and he pulled over to the side of the road and there is the gas station. I don&rsquo;t know if you know the place. It is called Cosmo Gas Station and Cosmo Restaurant. It&rsquo;s right on the way to Tucson. We go into the place to buy gas, and the owner had a little store on the side. I saw the present. It was a brass crucifix and I picked it up and somehow it didn&rsquo;t ring a bell completely. It was ideal yet it didn&rsquo;t fit; and I said &ldquo;well tomorrow is the crucifiction (Good Friday,) there is something wrong. I turned around and on the shelf behind me is a little dish-plate with the last supper painted into it. I said &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and when I reached for it I could feel the vibration , and the price was so appropiate. The owner started to laugh. We were getting something so beautiful for almost peanuts. But the person whom the present was for would appreciate having it and discovering it on a day like yesterday. That was so amazing about it. Now tonight we are discussing one of the most unusual moments in life-on Good Friday-that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about. Is it realy the crucifixon or the sorrow of death? Or is it something that leads to the triumph of what are we all living here for? Society is geared to live to die and it&rsquo;s not an ideal process. It&rsquo;s creating sickness. But you&rsquo;re got to live a certain amount of years to prepare to retire, to phase off, and be placed in the soil ,and to look for some nebulous region in the heavens, and you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually there. Then you can go along through life with tremondous conviction-it&rsquo;s there. But the real test is when you lay down and die. And then here we celebrate and remember a life that is lived on the planet and that is gone. Yet the challenge is not today. The challenge is the day after tomorrow. What happens? The triumph of death. But it&rsquo;s not so much the triumph of death&ndash; that is what you are looking for; what we are looking for is how to live to live and not live to die. All through the centuries man has lived to die and took out his vengence on his fellow man in order to eliminate it so you won&rsquo;t have to face it. And then here comes along an incident where the man Jesus raised another person from the grave showing that living to die isn&rsquo;t really the goal of life. Why raise another dead man from the grave if living to die, to find God is the true purpose? But living to live, to encounter God, is now in your immediate life, is the real challenge and the real experience. Yogananda use to say everything else can wait but the search for God cannot because it&rsquo;s a conscious now experience, not something nebulous and far beyond time. If you can&rsquo;t encounter it now in the waking state and really have the understanding and assurance of how it relates, you don&rsquo;t have anything. If you&rsquo;re all lying down dead in this room and God walks in and says &ldquo;Hi folks. What do you want,; your breath back, the power to perform miracles, or some possessions to make you the wealthiest people in the world?&rdquo; What would you choose? You sure would want your breath back! It doesn&rsquo;t look like much. It doesn&quot;t sound like much-right-compared to performing miracles and having possessions, yet you cannot perform miracles if you don&rsquo;t breathe. And you can&rsquo;t own anything if you don&rsquo;t breathe either. Is it in death or is it in life? When you understand where the real encounter is then you understand why Jesus said &ldquo;My God is a God of the living, not of the dead.&rdquo; Meaning, living to die has no assurance but it&rsquo;s the ideal way to function. But living to live is ideal. It&rsquo;s ideal because it guarentees it&rsquo;s ownself, it assures it&rsquo;s ownself. The ressurection is an indication of a guarantee. But more than that the principal is in nature. The butterfly is a model of it. The butterfly came before man because his enviroment was created for him to live in. Man-if you make man before you make his enviroment where would you put him? But you have to make the enviroment first in order to function in it as a man, male and female. But then you can&rsquo;t have someone in the sky constantly directing you. It won&rsquo;t make any sense. You have to place the laws of nature around you to allow you to discover by trial and error. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so beautiful about it; that each one of us is carrying his own cross and not the other person&rsquo;s cross. &ldquo;Pick up your cross and follow me.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t pick up mine. He picked up His today. Each one of us is carrying his own particular confrontation with life, not living to die in the confrontation,but living to live in the now, each one of us. Wherever you are, whatever your doing, that&rsquo;s the moment of confrontation. And it&rsquo;s the moment of living to live. So by leaving a butterfly as a model - the butterfly is a caterpillar - a worm - eats his way through life, spins a cocoon which you call a shroud, and emerges a different creature. Of all the creatures that can fly there&rsquo;s none more beautiful than a butterfly. And I have delibrately squashed up caterpillars and checked them to see how they rot, and squashed up butterflies, and compared them. And I&rsquo; never found a rotten butterfly but I&rsquo;v found rotten caterpillars, telling me without doubt that life is for living and not to run from it. And it&rsquo;s in that process when I look at the caterpillar I realized its tissue and I looked at my own body and its tissue. I am made of the same model. But I have one advantage over that caterpiller. I can muck-up my opportunity with my mouth; but he doesn&rsquo;t have to, he eats his way and becomes a butterfly. But I can make all kinds of mistakes with my words. Whatever I say to myself I get sick or I get healthy. The caterpillar doesn&rsquo;t do that to itself so thats my disadvantage and my advantage, how to regulate my spoken word to warrant the result of the process which is eternal body or nondecomposing bodies; or take it with you and you pass on into another realm. Now its not in the imagination. It&rsquo;s a natural face. We are already designed for it but our spoken word prevents us from experiencing it. When you say we are living to live we can leave the body as a testimony of a nondecomposing organism. That would defy the thinking individual. Or you can leave then an empty coffin and wonder where we went like Brother Jesus did. He left us an empty hole in the wall. And he&rsquo;s gone, but is He invisible or has He gone? That is the question. He hasn&rsquo;t gone. But He is visible and indivisible at command per- formances; meaning, He is here with us. We have to make the attempt to want to see the living in the living and not the living in the dead. All around us we think we are seeing living people. But really 99% of the time people around you who appear to be living are thinking of dying. They are thinking of what they are going to do when they reach 60 years of age, and phase off out of life. So they are already dead electrically and magnetically. They are just occupying space chemically. But if they are living to live they have this tremendous power available to them - to be in the world and not of the world. To be seen and not to be seen. Now is may seem far- feched but it&rsquo;s not. There is a book called &ldquo;The Incorruptables.&rdquo; There are over 300 case histories. I&rsquo;ll put it this way: one case history for each day of the month or the year. And 80% of the case histories are women of non-decomposing bodies on record. So you see it has nothing to do because who lives to die most of the time in all modern society? Did you ever hear a woman say she&rsquo;s living to retire? We always hear the best is what? He&rsquo;s working hard to retire - right? All a woman says is that she is tying to hang in there. We have to change our programing. We had better had because it&rsquo;s not practical and it&rsquo;s producing more sickness. Resurrection is not a far-fetched process. Every religion has its evidence,. But more so, people who don&rsquo;t belong to no religion, who mainly realize by virtue of trial and error, by the process of being practical moment to moment, are arriving in that state. Churchianity has nothing to do with the realization of God. Realization of God is a personal interaction of life. You are the living temple of God. You are the living church. It&rsquo;s not some building like this that you go to on a Sunday. If God were to rest what would happen to us? We&rsquo;d be in a bad place. He can&rsquo;t turn off this equiptment called the universe. He has to be everywhere. So he is his own devil! By playing His own devil he tests His own creation. But we never ask about it that way. Once we begin to realize and live in it we begin to realize that God is and always will be. Not a person sitting on a throne. A principal that has become the universe locked up in man to talk back to himself. That&rsquo;s the funny part of it. Of all the creatures in the world to worship God, they know in the 80&rsquo;s. Man endowed with individuality to talk to himself. See, He has to convince Himself and that&rsquo;s the uniqueness of it. By becomming His creation and taking the roll of man which is flesh and setting up individuality in order to give it a sense of uniqueness. The individuality is the process of which the creator talks back to Himself. Now, when you are awake and you are looking at me right now you have individuality and you feel diff- erent. You may accept what I say or reject it because you&rsquo;re awake and you are hearing me talking to you in English and you&rsquo;re using your memory training because you are programed to English; therfore you comprehend what I am saying. I look Oriental so if I spoke to you: you would not understand what the hell I was saying to you, (laughter,) right? So there you go. What the hell is that guy talking about? You see, our words suddenly lose their sense of value, and their individuality has a problem. Now all of us go to sleep at night. When you are sound asleep do you know if you are a man or a woman, no matter if you spoke Chinese, English or French? You see? But God, He isn&rsquo;t going any place. He is still holding us together, allowing us to breathe; and if you don&rsquo;t wake up, it&rsquo;s over. That&rsquo;s facts that you have got to live with every day. From the dawn of creation when we knew the universe began, to when it ends - midnight eternity. That&rsquo;s a long time. So He is not going out of business, but he is providing a unique process by which His indiv- idualized manifestations can be permanent, and not resolve itself into a unified field. He wants us to be permanent by giving us individuality, by allowing us to experience trial and error to discover living to die or living to live. And living to live is &ldquo;To he who overcometh I will not send forth a second time but will make him a pillar in the house of the Lord&rdquo;, incorruptable. Or the option of that is to appear and disappear at will, still not corruptable. See what I mean? Look what you got when you begin to realize it. Your best friend, (Adano kisses His own hand here,) self love, not nartistic, cosmic. No greater love than he who would lay down his cells for his fellow man, but greater love is he who can recognize the God in himself. That&rsquo;s the greater love because I can&rsquo;t love you like myself. I can only love you as myself. There is a vast difference. See. &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of thy mind not part of the mind. So you can&rsquo;t sleep you know,. You can&rsquo;t die, that&rsquo;s the end of the mind, but that&rsquo;s no all. If you&rsquo;re going to love Him you&rsquo;re going to do what? Be alive, awake, alert and enthusiastic, and,with all your heart. It&rsquo;s got to be counted conscious now, all your strength. The respitory rate has got to be envolved, and soul. That&rsquo;s your individuality. You are soul. If you have soul it&rsquo;s preposterous to ask the body to save it. But because you&rsquo;re an individ ualist in the creative process, you can use your individualism to exhalt your reality and bring out the soul- ness of it which is God in you. Make it a permanent principal. If you have soul it is preposterous to ask the body to save it, but because you are an individualist in the creative process you can use your indiv- idualism to exhault your reality and bring out the soulness of it which is God in you. Make it a perman- ent principal. &quot; To him that overcometh&rdquo; - overcometh this flux - you won&rsquo;t have to do it a second time. We may be at a hundred million second time right now waiting to make the transition , but in making a pillar a pillar is a structure of something that doesn&rsquo;t change in the house of the Lord, in this whole crea- tive process. So the only way we could become permanent would be like the butterfly emerging out of the caterpillar - the incorruptable. As we achieve this incorruptable state we have the individualism still locked up in us to go back and forth in the universe being visible and invisible on command performance. For that reason early man created his communication by saying &ldquo;I believe in the communion with the saints.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a vast difference to say I believe in the communion with spirits. The saint was once a living human being who went through the transition of going from the visible to thje invisible, and from breakdown to nonbreakdown. Therefor he has no hangups and he has no games to play. He&rsquo;s not here to take advantage of you or try to get you into God. He is here to remind you that you have God in you. The psysic may not. Ge can be carried away. He is the moth that flies to the light and gets burned up. The butterfly is different. It doesn&rsquo;t fly to the light to get burned uyp. It emerges out of the caterpillar by the process of , gradual anguish, of eating it&rsquo;s way and comes out a beautiful creature that can fly. Tkhat&rsquo;s the transition of the true person. That is the path that the great man Jesus come to show. His life is that model in hhaman form taken from the cosmic law laid up in the caterpillar to the butterfly. All the great souls that demonstrate this are his brothers and sisters because the Christ principal is locked up in you already. That is why he said in simple language &quot; the things I do you can do also, but not greater than me&rdquo; - right or wrong? I know it is wrong because if he said that , then I say &ldquo;right brotherJesus, you are the only one and true son of God. I&rsquo;d throw myself down here because you are number one and will always be number one. But he never said that. He said &ldquo;the things I do you can do and greater things shall you do. &quot; It means the option to be free is locked up in you, if you grasp it and apply it. Because he grasped it within himself and applied it, he grasped the greater quality, the greater power locked up in himself. Now we have to grasp it. When it is put into simple language it simply means we have to grasp the desire to live to live and not live to die. Living to die is not the Christ state. The Christ state that will offer you death and it dies in itself cannot be a Christ state. It has to offer you life and remain as a living principal in itself. If God is life and God is in everything and endowers you and I with individuality to experience to see if you are willing to take a chance with your individuality at the conscious level. Unconsciously when you are sound asleep you won&rsquo;t know. That happens to you from the time you are born, your conscious,and you, must go through your life-part of it- unconscious; and you may go through your whole life with that portion of unconscious, never happening, never finding out what realy occurs, what realy happens in that period of your life. Who are you? What are you doing there? What am I believing or what am I actually trying to experience? A vast difference -what I believe versus what I actually am-are two different things-like night and day. I can believe in a lot of things; but it can turn out I may be wrong. Then I&rsquo;m destroyed with my delusion. What I actually am is not going to fool me because that is exactaly what I&rsquo;ll always be. Now I am atomic energy ! I&rsquo;m not going any place! Ancient man called it spirit. Modern man calls it cosmic force. Whatever you want to call it, it&rsquo;s not going any place. It is. Like it or not. When Jesus said &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father,&rdquo; you see this body, you see the cosmic principal. &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; This individuality and this principal are one in the same thing. We arn&rsquo;t going any place. You are stuck with it. Two things equal to the same thing are equal to what? Newton&rsquo;s law-one another. You and I -yes-are one in the same; but at different levels os expression called individuality. The realization is your moment to moment encounter. I&rsquo;m not here to mold you into anything, Iam here to find who I am. You are here to find out who you are. But we could be locked into a long time arguement as to how you will mold each other, and hate each other; and yet when we fall asleep at night all the molding is over (laugh,) and all the hatred is over and if we never wake up what did we learn? Nothing, because we are back right where we started to find out what we are when we are sound asleep. You see, thats why Paul quit trying to go around converting people. Do you know why he quit? It was when he realized he coudn&rsquo;t control his internal life. He said, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing.&rdquo; Meaning: You can go around rejoicing in your converting these Jewish people to become Christians. I quit because I live and die daily in the Lord right now. I don&rsquo;t know of any other process that I have found out that this is where it is at - not trying to con- vert. You can&rsquo;t make a rose into a daisy. A rose is a rose and a daisy is a daisy. Both have to get inside. I have to intergrade too. At the process of breathing we come into this world and we cut the cord. If we breathe on time they keep us. If we don&rsquo;t breathe on time they bury us. Then we start all over again. You are lucky if you think of it: you made thiry years, forty years, sixty years. You are lucky because, consider all the belief systems that proceeded you before you got to this point- where you are ready to accept yourself for who and what you are. You are more concerned now, not what you believe, # and it&rsquo;s derogatory conditions to discard it. It&rsquo;s no loss. It&rsquo;s what you actually are now-what you are to yourself. That is what you have to go through. So once you accept that you and the Father are one, the comedy of it is that it makes life much more simple. The simplicity of it is that your loving your enemy for the first time for what they actually are. If you haven&rsquo;t got any more enemies, whose your enemy now? The belief systems are your enemy now not another person. So you realize what is yourself. You revitalize yourself and you begin to live. How many people in the audience here have read &ldquo;Autobiography of A Yogi&rdquo;? When Yogananda&rsquo;s teacher was suppose to have died Yogananda was torn up as any other person would be as a human being; yet when his teacher comes back and greets him Yogananda thinks it is an apparition. [spelling?] and Yog- ananda rushes up to meet the teacher and hugs him. The teacher says &ldquo;hey man let go, you&rsquo;ll squeeze the hell out of me.&rdquo; [Laughter here.] This hurts you know. like Thomas reaching out to Jesus. Gosh fellow, make sure. And Jesus comes through the door and eats with the disciples. These are the things that make people realize what the atomic principal is. We have had a lot of sudo ex- periences , but the general experiences are always genuine. That is why your churches decided to set up a difference between the psysic experience and the actual spiritual experience. The prayer &ldquo;I believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; means the correction of my own misapplied decisions. There are no sins to fear in this world but misapplied decisions. I have to accept that I must make decisions. I can make correct ones or incorrect ones. I have to live out the correct ones as well as the incorr- ect ones. Assuming the responsibility to correct them is my cross or, like you say, my burden, not yours. All realized people begin to realize it in the end; and once they accept the actuality of it they are living to live, therefore there is no sin. There is just trial and error in learning. You are learning by error, you see. You make a mistake to compare, not to make it again. To have life without mistakes you would not know where to go; but to have life in order to make mistakes you have something to compare now to move it. So when they say &ldquo;forgiveness of sins&quot;meaning we give ourselves more time to correct our selfmade incorrect decisions that we have lived we have to correct it ourselves. The saint is the same. Saint - a Latin word meaning sane. He&rsquo;s not trying to run your life. He at least has discovered how to live in a sane way by living to live, and the model is that they are there. They don&rsquo;t impose since thy are cosmic nursemaids. (Laughter.) You know, you hire a nursemaid to take care of the children while you go to work. Basically, when we realize ourselves what job do we have? We are all working for &ldquo;big Daddy.&rdquo; So who is down here undeveloped? Your brother and sister is another form of you Who is down here locked up in individualized states? It is the same God because it is life flowing in and out, and the interesting phenomenon is this: do you think the amount of life force that is inside of you is any different from the quanity in my body or anyone else in this room? They have tested this already. The amount is exactly three ounces. From the time they cut the cord you weigh exactly three ounces more after the cord is cut. When you finally quit breathing you weigh exactly three ounces less. So that three ounces of food belongs to? It&rsquo;s God in His creative nature playing roles of individuality. We are stuck in our big fat ego thinking we are going to hold on. We can&rsquo;t hold on to the wrong program of living to die. The ego is no assert there. In living to live we can be blessed to have the reward of keeping that process in the mechanism that no longer breaks down. The very same oxygen that keeps us going in living to die suddenly becomes an asset in living to live. Now if Jesus and all these great men didn&rsquo;t come to teach us to live to live we would not be celebrating the next two days, (Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday,) because that is the evidence we have. It is the next two days, how we accept these laws and look at it, what is open to us. Two thousand years ago we could not comprehend how to handle it. We are only fourteen years from the year two thousand. We have all the equiptment around us to validate, but man is eternal if he learns to live to live. But if he learns to live to die, he has to repeat the process over and over; but since this is not a mass exodus to God realization at the very individualist process, each one has his own cross to carry. I can&rsquo;t carry yours, but whoever arrives at that process and is established, becomes a cosmic nursemaid. (A Guru.) See-because what other love can we be applying once we arrive. We can only apply the love of inspiration, the love of confidence, the love of assurance, the love of guarantee to the individual who is struggling to work through their own individuality to the one reality. So it is like a a jigsaw puzzle and realization is like the turnstyle. We always slip out one at a time. (Laughter) So what do we have in our consciousness to work with? The most important thing is this journey of now, see, it is not going any place. It is called the journey of now, inward; and it sounds like a journey of going some place,, but you are not going any place. It is a journey of coping more than going. It is a big difference between looking at a place. It is a current in now, a journey of coping in the now. And since now and coping are all contained by the creative me, that is why Moses had to confront it: &ldquo;There is no God before me&rdquo; and &ldquo;do not have any graven image,&rdquo; Do not look for any image outside of yourself that is going to represent me. Me is already locked up there. You only can point to this one, me (yourself.) Me flowers, me leaf, me table. You don&rsquo;t like it? That is too bad! He will always be a flower to Himself; so I have got to come to the realization the me, God, is here already. Moses would look inside and say the burning bush is the light inside of your head. Who are you? I am that I am. Well, how can any object identify itself without using the words I am? I am God. I am a bird. I am a potato. I am Adano. I am lucky. I am. All the I AMs make it what? One big I am. You see? Even Jesus said &ldquo;I and the Father are one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;you see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; These men understood the reality of living to live and broke away from the illusion of living to die. And that is what you call the ignorance of ignorance. There is no sin. It is just ignoring and misapplying your decisions to your commitment; yet you have to come back to correct it. That is what is so beautiful about the process. If you are a teacher and you had a student that took and examination and he did not pass would you put him in the next class, or would you send him back to do it all over again? Right? So this is basically the fundamental unity that underlines all individual forms. At the individual level we have to confront our nature by trial and error. We may make mistakes, wrong decisions and we can&quot;t expect to go any further in understanding if we don&rsquo;t correct it because it will come back to confront us. The sooner you realize it the quicker you get healthy because-why? You don&rsquo;t feel as vulnerable any more. You don&rsquo;t feel trapped any more. That is why Jesus said confess your sins before your fellow man. Confront your mistakes before others. Re-evalute it and get on the ball with what? Living now! It is easy to resolve the anguish by talking then by holding it and trying to withdraw to avoid it. That is living to die. More and more as we become conscious of what we are we automatically face ourselves and internal healing begins because healing is already locked up in us. It is denied us when we live to die because we have already shut it out with some kind of a notion that we are going some place to get it, and when we do get there, it is not there; but if we accept it here in the now and it is locked up in the creative me and the individually I</p>

<p>Adano87_05_15_2SolarQ3 - Christianity is the banana that I have to eat, but I can&rsquo;t eat a banana that is rotten without any skin because the bugs will get it before I get it. So no amount of truth in the world is totally isolated from fixation, orientation, and organization. All truth are locked in that way. The person who is in the process of unfolding has to discern between the fixations of &ldquo;who&rdquo; versus the actual of &ldquo;what is.&rdquo; And that is your journey, that is your cross, that is your challenge, and that is your accomplishment.

<p>Adano88_03_26_1SatsangQ1NW5 - 2:11 I&rsquo;ll put it this way, all the knowledge that has come down to us if we were to apply it in our simple way, day to day, these words could be your greatest measuring stick for living in the carbon based body, &ldquo;I accept the communication of the Saint.&rdquo; But Their communication has nothing to do with channeling. Their communication is actual manifestation of Themselves for you to check&rsquo;em out because They&rsquo;re your brothers and your sisters so They can&rsquo;t play games in your head. Therefore I accept that type of relationship. The next statement is &ldquo;there are no sins to forgive, but misapplied decisions.&rdquo; I accept responsibility to correct my own misapplied decisions no matter where I did them, I accept that responsibility to correct it and if you ask God, &ldquo;Is there a sin?&rdquo; He may say, &ldquo;Yeah, when you don&rsquo;t look at Me.&rdquo; Now who is Me? Yourself, you see? So that&rsquo;s why Jesus put in a nice way by saying, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all of your mind. You can&rsquo;t do it with part of your mind, so it gotta be all of your mind so Me is involved in the all and with all of your heart, all of your strength, all of your breath, and your neighbor as yourself. Everything is, but that&rsquo;s the understanding that brings you to the&hellip; that you will resolve all the misapplied decisions that were done and correct them. 2:13 So that&rsquo;s valid, God will clean up His own act via the individuality. Individuality triggered it, individuality can clean it up and resolve it in the unified field, that&rsquo;s your true self. And last but not least, the atom is eternal, I am made from the atoms. I am 144 elements. I ain&rsquo;t going no place because who am I? I and the Father are one? Two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another? Am I immortal or am I just a figment of my imagination? Audience: Immortal. Adano: Good, then if I&rsquo;m immortal, then you make the declaration, &ldquo;I will do the cleanup, or the dirty work, because I trigger it off myself through my individuality as an opportunity to experience differential relationship &rsquo;till midnight eternity. In other words God, creating His universe out of a unified field, has to impress back upon His nature the highest integrity of individuality of assuming responsibility for the role as an individual. It&rsquo;s what you call Superman emerging out of Clark Kent (laughing from Adano and the audience). The maturity of the super being out of the individual. The quality that&rsquo;s inside of you that must emerge for, what you say, assuming responsibility for being you. Not afraid of it, not running from it. That&rsquo;s in essence what we are saying and it is there that They&rsquo;re trying to teach us and we&rsquo;ll constantly be reminded by it in all the different meditational groups. We&rsquo;ll have it more and more, seeing it everyday.</p>

<p>Adano88_03_28TucsonSatsangQ1NW3 - 00:22 So the person who is realized, he isn&rsquo;t wiser, or better than. That isn&rsquo;t what the word realized means, or implies. It is a person who has come to accept that each moment is unrehearsed, each moment is unique, and each moment is all they have. So some wise man wrote a long time ago, &ldquo;after looking through my life, I come to realize that I have to live every moment of my life from now on as if it were my last moment.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way he summed it up. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have any moment to look forward to or look back on. There is no way I can pick up yesterday or tomorrow. It is a respiratory principle and worrying about others wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. What we can do for others is keep the thought of a cooperativeness which you yourself would feel in your present time frame as you cooperate with your timeframe. This particular condition will go out to help others to sense this cooperativeness and it gets stronger in them and they begin to cope with situations instead of panic. More important is that you accept that there are moments in your life that you will be threatened with situations that you aren&rsquo;t prepared for, you&rsquo;ll feel competent or incompetent, but until it happens or you have to live it, what would you do, worry about it?

Looks can be changed instantly, relive journey of sperm to ovum, moving electrons, rebirthing - got to meditate!, Ovum #149 calling sperm #149, 4 of June - story of Swami Ananda &amp; story of him being made Swami, G.U.R.U., skin knows how to breath, &ldquo;investiture&rdquo; &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; &ldquo;be here now&rdquo; 2:10 See there is no commandment, thou shalt not lie, because the whole universe is a what? an illusion, optical illusion or Maya or relativity, centered upon acceleration, elements playing this particular process of holding things together in a geometrical shape by resonance, that’s the spoken word. Your own spoken word holds up the geometry and your own spoken word separates the geometry. So if you’re going to be honest with your cells, you have to make the commitment and finish it by doing it and just don’t say it and don’t do it because they’ll pull you out from underneath and let you face your own dirt. See? So that is why placebo works. The scientist doesn’t like it, but it’s a preparation for the acceptance of commitment&hellip; Thank you. Well I guess we gotta hit the road. I love you folks&hellip;</p>
<p>Adano00_1AdanoQ4NW4 - Misc topics. Mantra means spiritual aid, designed to help you understand yourself. Psalms are laid out to show us an ethical way to live. Harassment is like a picador (bullfight) and well wishers in a family are like picadors. Meditation disciplines: focusing the eyes (pick a point / focus without blinking), art of breathing (I and my Father are One is a breathing technique), art of hearing (demonstration of Hong So technique from Yogananda), discipline of feeling (left thumb on right wrist and locate pulse, built in rosary / metronome). Story of Indian Chief and Minister from Assembly of God church, Chief is just wearing a blanket. Minister says &ldquo;Chief, don&rsquo;t you feel cold?&rdquo; Chief says &ldquo;tell me friend, do you cover your face in the wintertime?&rdquo; Chief pulls aside blanket and he is naked and says &ldquo;Me all face.&rdquo; That was a prayer technique that Adano learned. Story about a student (later the Swami that initiated Adano) who did not think he was making progress. His teacher asked him &ldquo;How long can you sit down and meditate without getting restless.&rdquo; The teacher and student meditated and at the end of one hour, the teacher nailed the student calf to the floor with an old rusty nail. Then healed the student saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the scar so you will know how far you are in god.&rdquo; Master Jesus was not suffering on the cross either. The most difficult part of the discipline is feeling. Body getting stiff during meditation is feeling diminishing in certain areas, but the mind is craving sensation. So it sets up an alarm system and end of meditation.</p>
<p>Adano00_01FromEdQ4NW1 - Not eating. Weight gain / loss. 10 36 radicals. Diseases are placebo. If you label it, you got it. Yes, no, and maybe of what is actually involved. The pineal gland is a lens that provides convex vision. 20 Getting the real understanding 30 Pickup your own cross and follow me. Love the Lord with all your mind, strength, and soul. And your neighbor as yourself that&rsquo;s the key to immortality. Butterfly eats his way to butterfly-hood. Psychophysical synchronicity, a spiritual person is a practical person, moment to moment action represents immunity, disengagement of unity, free love w/o coercion, surrender timing to consciousness, can you act what you say, convex vision, karmic or spermal.</p>
<p>Adano00_1SolarQ4NW7 - Acid / alkaline nitrazine paper. Meal is comprised of protein, carbohydrate, mineral / vitamin, lipid or oil, liquid or water. 10 Animal flesh doesn&rsquo;t have nitrogen. 20 Almonds have nitrogen and all 12 basic minerals. 30 Animals go over animals that are not healthy. 40 Adrenaline and uric acid in meat attacks liver, pancreas. 50 Spirulina is built to raise the enervation level. Take it at night if from Mexico. Afternoon if from the US. 1:00 Almonds set the hydrochloric acid, eat them first. 1:10 Morning, afternoon, evening timings. Boiled oranges.</p>
<p>Adano00_02FromEdQ4NW1 - You are your own heaven and hell with your tongue. Love backward is evol-ving. You got all eternity to evolve. Ever new love, ever new joy or you would get bored with it. Come in sperm 162. 10 Spermal confrontations. 20 Living in the now is the liberation from the conditions imposed by the planetary system. Saturn is Greek for Chronos, Father time. 30 The Law of Miracles in Autobiography of a Yogi is the Unified Field. 40 Creative Intelligence is playing a fantastic game and gambling on it, but the creation cannot win, it can only surrender to it. &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s banking that Man will play every game to avoid giving unconditional love. 50 Cold war and whose language will setup the behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Adano00_2SolarQ4NW7 - The challenge for the mechanism is to work your way through. You can live / function minus the meat, but some blood types crave it: A and AB even though they are designed to not be meat eaters. They are designed to eat grain that has acid that doesn&rsquo;t affect them. However, they crave the experience of acid from meat. Type B and O craves to be a non-meat eater. 10 Story about man with amoebic dysentery. A little Sake helped it. 20 Sake is made from grass. Rice is a neutral food. 1 lb wild rice, 3 lbs of brown rice combined is the ultimate form of protein. Can be used in place of almonds. Short grain is a little more acid than long grain. Mucus can be caused by having grains at the wrong time (morning). Gas, mucus, and hardening of the tissues are signs of food out of time cycle. 30 We are at the mercy of nature if we don&rsquo;t have a stability backup like an anchor being carried by a boat which is only used during storms. Nighttime foods. 40 Vitamin C from nightshade plants like tomatoes and bell pepper. The tomato is a fruto-vegetable, a cross between the two. It behaves like a  bat, it flies and has no wings with a face like a rat. It hunts at night in the dark. Tomato climbs like a vine, but behaves like a fruit and has vitamin C that doesn&rsquo;t break down with heat. Don&rsquo;t crack fingers sideways. 50 Seaweed is for gonad and uterine canal plus eggs and fish for reproductive organs. Oysters for horniness. Iodine / seaweed for regenerative organs. Vitamins phase out in alcohol so nature has made the maguey plant (cactus) in the bromeliad family. The leaves are like the public hair. Genital problems that are toxic are solved by vitamin C. Herpes is a drastic problem with lack of vitamin C. Maguey plant (tequila) is good for this. 1:00 Story about man running race drinking apple juice, then orange juice when finished. Excellent results. 1:10 Different racial groups have different time to phase out cow dairy products (latest is around 21). Goat milk is alkaline in reaction. 1:20 Explanation of times for different foods. Most heart attacks happen after lunch from out of time eating. Giving them oxygen helps them at this time.</p>
<p>Adano00_3SolarQ4NW7 - Medicinal dose of alcohol is a teaspoon. Smells of apples in relationship to ripeness. 10 Farmers picking fruit at the range of malic acid smelling like ammonia to prevent worms from eating them. Light affects the odor of plants. Alcohol from potatoes, beets, etc. 20 The organs have to be fed and cleaned in each time cycle through fruit in each light cycle. Morning cleansing is the best time through fruits and nuts. Afternoon heavy meal and cleaning with grapes, melons, berries, and evening semi-heavy meal and pineapple. Daylight savings time is for economics. 30 Checking timing of the body at 3 AM. Environment is God and you are God. If the two aren&rsquo;t synchronized, then there is discordance. 3 AM = right nostril. 40 Story about Sonny biting into a hamburger with a toothpick and having to go to the hospital instead of going to the front lines of the war. Adano recommended that Sonny create pains in his body because he was too pure and was losing his immunity to pain. Sonny got sick one day and started losing weight. The doctor&rsquo;s scared him and he went on a long fast to clean up his body. Adano recommended again that he get some pain in his body, but Sonny went ahead with the fast. He called Adano to meet him at 6 PM. When Adano got there, Sonny had killed himself and left a note for Adano that said: &ldquo;I refuse to suffer.&rdquo; Adano went and got a bottle of rum in honor of his father who forced Adano to drink to cure him of his toxicity. He never got rum after that until Sonny&rsquo;s death. 50 Adano born during gallbladder time so he thrives on foods in the middle of the day (and he had his gallbladder removed). Adano got on the path when he was living in Canada in 1945. He looked for a 100 books on God. He was broke at the time and realized he wasn&rsquo;t being practical to survive. He had only $3. He was looking at a photo of Yogananda and turned over on his bed and locked the shutters. Just about midnight to 1 AM, he saw what looked like a firefly that moved. It got bigger and kept moving until it went to Yogananda&rsquo;s picture. Only the eyes of the photo were talking to him. The eyes were saying &ldquo;none come unto the Father, but by me.&rdquo; The next day &ldquo;Autobiography of a Yogi&rdquo; fell off the shelf. Adano recognized Yogananda&rsquo;s face on the book. He read the book from beginning to end. He wrote to Yogananda and Yogananda wrote back &ldquo;none come unto the Father, but by me. I accept you as a student.&rdquo; Adano then found a job as a chef in a Chinese restaurant. Then he took the SRF lessons and soon got a letter from Yogananda that said &ldquo;Prepare yourself for initiation.&rdquo; 1:00 He took a bath and sat down in front of the picture. In a few minutes, he felt a big thumb on his forehead. Adano&rsquo;s eyes started flaring up and he walked in that state for 7 days. He could see the future, but couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. It phased down after he stopped analyzing it. Adano wrote again and ask where he could get 100 books about God. Yogananda said, &ldquo;What is all the knowledge in all the book compared to 15 silence in the Soul.&rdquo; It took Adano 18 years to achieve this. 1:10 Maple syrup has iron. Cherries have iron. Black olives. &ldquo;A little bit of anything is medicine, too much is toxic.&rdquo; 1:20 &ldquo;There is a time, place, and a season for everything.&rdquo; King Solomon (King Solar-man)</p>
<p>Adano00_4ScienceoftheSoulQ1NW4 - God as the Divine Creative Intelligence, knowing our origins, in the science of the soul you must always get the same result / the same common experience, what the same common experience of man? = peace, bliss, God is not a person sitting on a throne, man must accept a wide scope of god that he can relate to tangibly, to a dying man God is the next breath which brings him joy because he has more life to pursue his desires, this joy is God to a dying man, to a man who is poor God is the joy of winning the sweepstakes or gotten an inheritance because he is secure now that he can pay his bills, removing his fear and insecurity. The common feeling is Joy. The person who is sorrowful and needs sympathy from his fellow man. The moment it is extended to him is joy. You walk out on the street and the rain is falling and your clothes are wet and someone comes along and offers you an umbrella, that brief Joy is God. He is making us realize through our very structure that He is the Joy of ourselves. The Saints call it Bliss, the Divine Rapture, ordinary people call it Joy. Prayer is the first link in the Science of the Soul, Jesus being asked how to Pray. Pray is a privilege and a two way communication, prayer brings results according to how it is applied. Prayer in a transmitting stage should be asking the Creative Intelligence for understanding. The second type of prayer is reception (the adult prayer), in this stage God is talking to us giving us ideas or inspiration to act in the environment. Some of us cannot accept inspiration from God because we have a mental conflict because we cannot tell fellow man that God has talked us. God is the divine broadcaster as a divine joy coming in the heart and this broadcasting force is coming through us to insure us against the pull of negative vibrations in the environment so we can face of obligations and work in the environment. Reasoning blocks the wonderment of consciousness (child-like quality), and reason causes the inner life to dry up, but Reason, logic, and experimentation is the second link in the science of the soul because it allows us to believe and know the creative forces, wisdom, divine reasoning, intuition. Prayer can be brought into a day to day experimentation alone or in groups, using our reasoning to plan and work in our environment, a proper, balanced existence in our environment and we are an extension of our environment. Prayer cannot create a microphone, it takes reason also. At 39 minutes, good summary of above. However, over attachment is a burden of reason and logic, so the next stage is meditation, how do we transcend the pull of our desires by the very things we have constructed around us so they don&rsquo;t become a burden to the mind. Meditation is that next link that frees us and helps us to transcend the pull. Meditation is the ability now to receive the thought waves from the Creative Intelligence surrounding you, flowing through you, inspiring you to the oneness with the Creator. The Soul is an extension of the Creator, like the image is an extension of the original form. Breaking the illusion that we are separated from Him. Example of the reflections of the moon in ten glasses of water, breaking glasses, mopping up water, and getting back to the original image (feeling the oneness back). Meditation is an acronym for Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities Towards an Intuitive Observation / Oneness with Numenon. Being independent of the five senses for the first time. A total identity with the divine life. You can&rsquo;t stay in that state, so don&rsquo;t be despondent when you shrink back out of that state otherwise you would be taken away by men in white coats. Joy from Prayer (sending / receiving), Joy from Reason, and Joy from Oneness of who you are because you are transcending the pull of the senses, lined up with the divine current consciously. Master can assume the karmic debt and extend the period of payoff without extra interest. The technique is called Initiation (baptism) drawing the energies toward an inward flow. See the radiant form of the Master. &ldquo;As many received him to them gave ye the power to be Sons of God,&rdquo; radiant light. Stories of life control: Jesus raising the dead, Lazarus (rich and poor), the Centurion&rsquo;s child, himself. &ldquo;My God, my God, why has though forsaken me&rdquo; was Jesus&rsquo; mantra from Psalm 22 allowed Jesus to pull the energy into the brain and hold it. Blue is Christ Intelligence, five pointed star that looks like a Dove diving down like when Jesus was being baptized. The Science of the Holy Breath is a gift, Master Yogananda empowered many to initiate. Initiation gives the person the key to shift gears so that you can go on.</p>
<p>Adano00_4SolarQ4NW7 - Certain illnesses require immunization, but to not become toxic wash the area with apple cider vinegar and put castor oil on it. Sake is the most neutral alcohol. One teaspoon of local alcohol when traveling as a natural immunization for the colon. Plantain must be cooked. 10 Cashew is a fruit (cashew pear). Vine ripened / falling off the vine is best for tomatoes raw, otherwise cooked. Sprouted beans have high content of nitrogen with protein or cook it with grain. 20 Mushrooms should be cooked otherwise the spores can take hold in the colon (manure). Story about New Yorker peanut farming in Texas not realizing peanuts grow underground. 30 Salted peanuts are not the best. Peanuts are needed for protein and for the reaction on the liver. It has a mineral that is ideal for the liver, making it elastic. Good for alcoholics. Raw peanuts are not the best. Two teaspoons apple cider vinegar, two teaspoons honey, and 8 ounces of distilled water is the only thing you should drink while eating. Eat a solar food after a difficult conversation to relax the body. Phases out the reaction of hostility. 40 Yucca has to be cooked. Uses for various foods. Dextrinization to make food &ldquo;high octane.&rdquo; Bypasses time in the colon for utilization. 180 degrees 15-20 minutes. 50 Almonds to set your weight. Add an almond for another 10 pounds, remove an almond to decrease 10 pounds. 1:00 Drink cold liquids to gain weight. Drink warm liquids to lose weight. Carbon dioxide causes bloating which is a result of fermenting toxins. Dancing is good to reduce CO2. &ldquo;Autopractic technique&rdquo; = working on yourself. &ldquo;Shake and shiver.&rdquo; 1:10 30 years to muck it up, 10 year cycle x 3. Three score and ten does not mean to die. It means to become the patriarch to show them how to live without the conditions. When people live to 100 then do more decision activity. So you would be eating less because it requires less heavy foods to make decisions, but the brain wouldn&rsquo;t be ready before then. You have to grow up and see it all before you make the decision. 1:20 When you eat and the time you eat it, attitude still plays an important part because even Jesus says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you put in that defiles you, it is what comes out that defiles you.&rdquo; The enzymes working on the minerals in the saliva creates toxicity from the sonic resonance of the words. It depends on how you say it. 1:30 Adano helps somebody with cramps. It&rsquo;s not the calcium, it&rsquo;s the iron that&rsquo;s the real problem.</p>
<p>Adano00_05FromEdQ4NW1 - The script is only 99% valid. 1% is random surprise which is reserved. He who is strong enough to wrench the dice out of the hand of the decision of Fate, changes the whole game, but you have to have the strength. The 1% is defying the laws in terms of existing conditions which he has to face. Kal is time. Sat is conscious. The path of the realized man is one of conscious exhortation by verbalization over the time relationship by anxiety. The universe is a sonic process geared down to geometry to exhibit time. Time takes precedence of geometry and sonics takes precedence over time. Optics is needed to examine it. Sonic can only be heard. 10 We must live our sonics. The movie Altered States showed the fallacy of chemistry over time. Adano falling off the building. His brain was operating faster than optics which allowed him to push off the building and landed on the grass by six inches. 20 Moving fast versus moving slow in people&rsquo;s thinking. Environment is synchronous with input and storage of one&rsquo;s nature and you can only synchronize your action to match it to survive and that is timing and you override timing by what you say to yourself. Insecurity is the only security. I thrive on insecurity. 30 You dream in alpha and theta, but not in delta. If you can stay in delta and be aware, you find out you&rsquo;re neither man nor woman. Dead men are all in delta, but they can&rsquo;t walk with it. Realized men are in delta, walking with it, and they know their neither man nor woman. &ldquo;Those who have eyes to see let them see and ears to hear, let them hear.&rdquo; Monroe Hemi-Sync tapes. I build biofeedback machines. Everybody can raise their body temperature, but it is very hard to lower temperature except in delta. When they photograph me, the upper portion of my lungs don&rsquo;t show up. Structure of the lungs: 5 lobes - two on the left and three on the right. Electromagnetic heart is on the right side. Jesus ascended to the right hand of the father. 72,000 nerve ends in polarity so 144,000. 40 Whirling Dervish&rsquo;s. Bio-oscillation to get ketchup out of a bottle. Bioemulsification of the Dervish&rsquo;s lymphatic system. 50 God is very mundane and very sacred. The sacredness of God is that we can&rsquo;t take away His job of making a creation. We have to survive and be satisfied to be a creation and Him be the Creator, but the beautifulness is the face that principle is embodied or in-resident in this organism as sonics, the ability to talk to one-self and by virtue of this embodiment and privilege, the atoms must obey me if I act what I say. It is that simple and that powerful and that dynamic, but if I don&rsquo;t, then I must pay the consequences by virtue of denial and lack of understanding and to be out of time is very obvious after awhile because you&rsquo;re going to goof up. 50 Question: How can I better time my stock market investments? Answer: I&rsquo;m going to answer you like a certain brother of mine told another friend. Your outer life, I have no control of, no matter you may seem to love me from within your heart. If ever you need to find central focus within your brain, close your eyes and see me if you can then discover what I can do for you at that point in terms of timing. As far as the external manifestation through your open eyes, I can&rsquo;t alter that for you. I can&rsquo;t eat for you, but I can help you to help yourself to eat correctly. We can&rsquo;t really alter people&rsquo;s outer lives. The outer live is your own responsibility, to make the mistakes and learn from it. Inner life is the relationship of gurus who can trigger a sense of unity with your nature. That is a different kind of relationship. I went to Las Vegas and won back every cent he spent to stay there. I don&rsquo;t want a penny more or penny less. I went four times to Vegas and broke even each time.

<p>Adano00_AndysHouseQ3NW1 - Andy Gallencia (sp?) in El Paso. Talking your problems with others is the healthiest form of therapy there is. Common exchange releases a lot of common illnesses in us. Yogic postures for people who refuse to change. Adano explains the Lion Pose, sticking your tongue out. Children wanting recognition all the time. They don&rsquo;t have an alternative to seeing this recognition. Parents can&rsquo;t let them get away with it. Adano helps a woman with her child&rsquo;s trauma with stomach problems. 10 What color comes to mind when you think of yourself pregnant with the boy. Blue. Can you think of any disappointment? Yes. Well that is carried over into the boy, in the pregnancy. 20 Continues to discuss the boy&rsquo;s eating problem and how the solution has to start with the parents. Like a mold with a scratch like an X. All the products made by the mold also have the X. You have to fix the mold. We heal ourselves but at the same time we heal our offspring. Yogis were psychological therapists grounded in physiology. 30 Yogis did a lot of biological techniques to heal people. Martial arts - built an image of the parents and attacked the images. (gap in tape). Alcohol kept in the mouth until the enzymes break it down from stinging to tasting sweet will not affect the brain. Melissa and Adano talking while traveling. Healing is not an occupation, it&rsquo;s a karmic debt that you&rsquo;re working out with people. When you work with sickness, this is karmic debt. So don&rsquo;t take it personally. Any other occupation you can advertise, but not therapy because you are working out karmic debts. They will find you which builds your capacity to serve. You&rsquo;re a channel for the goodness that flows through you to help others. 40 Initiation establishes the frequency of the therapist: Dissolving, eliminating, strengthening, and rebuilding are frequencies because you are correcting constriction / dilation which causes these conditions to appear. (gap in tape). Consciousness is a gun, words are bullets, don&rsquo;t monkey around with it unless you get hurt with it. A real therapist doesn&rsquo;t talk much. He can&rsquo;t have ifs, and buts, and maybes in his head. Once he finds the frequency, it&rsquo;s like a machine gun. If you know your frequency is strengthening, then you use it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the target it. I have a machine gun that will shoot it down. But you don&rsquo;t worry about if they have a fortress, or an armament, or armies, the machine gun will do the job. You go to the person and hold them and strengthen the person. It isn&rsquo;t you who is healing, we only act as channels for the frequencies. The fine tuning of your technique is called timing. I only touched Andy last night, I only talked to the others because they didn&rsquo;t have anything I could work on. They all had trauma. They were all traumatized people. (gap in tape). There are certain things you have to keep to yourself to earn a livelihood. (gap in tape). Story about sheep with stripes and optic photography planting information in genetics of organisms. 50 God is not always working in the way people want it to be. Explanation of how the pyramids were made by sliding large rocks over sand. The sand acts like a ball bearing and the limestone slides on it. Once positioned, they remove the sand with a brush. (gap in tape). Limestone doesn&rsquo;t cut with a saw. You wet the limestone and then you take papyrus, jute, or horsehair. Grease it and put fillings of sand and it can be cut. (gap in tape). Adano explains Astro-cartography. 1:00 So what did I learn? Enjoy Now because that&rsquo;s all I got. The nostril that breathes is the divinity that is me and there is nobody out there to punish me for good or bad because there is no good or bad. The good or bad is my game I play with myself thinking I&rsquo;m important or unimportant. When in actuality, God became me and He&rsquo;s having a ball allowing me to make an ass of myself believing I&rsquo;m doggone stupid or ignorant or all kind of muck-up. And all He did tell me from the start of creation, &ldquo;Go forth, multiply, and have dominion, but don&rsquo;t setup your franchise.&rdquo; So multiply means produce yourself as much as you want - trillions upon trillions of times, have dominion - play the game of running the show, but don&rsquo;t hang on to nothing. So oh boy, is that a game? (somebody says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a show.&rdquo;) Yeah, and when you live it out by going through it, He says &ldquo;Here, keep your suit. Don&rsquo;t trade it back in. I don&rsquo;t need it. It&rsquo;s already yours.&rdquo; You can modify it, make it look male, female, skinny, young, fat, or aged, but it&rsquo;s all here. Permanent suit, it&rsquo;s called Living Soil. See I don&rsquo;t have a Soul, I&rsquo;m Soul, Living Soil, 144 elements in an immortal. (end of tape).</p>
<p>Adano00_AtBettysConversationsQ4NW3 - Sounds like Adano &amp; Melissa traveling at beginning of tape, Trauma is a verbalization of something in the brain. Delta - to release trauma - yawn &amp; shit. Accurate + Pressure - Acupressure. Yawning is a suction. Delta makes you tired because you think you have to be tired in that state since it usually happens when you are sleeping. (gap in tape). Discussion of working for oneself. 10 Credit cards vs. debit cards. Future forms of currency (US postage stamps). Post office and banks will merge to eliminate fraud. 20 Adano talks about currency in the future using checks and thumbprints. Quitting smoking by smoking all cigarettes in a day during mid-day. Cigarette points on ear. Take three balloons and put their faces on the balloons and then pop the balloons. The cigarette is a dependency pattern. Sticking the tongue out helps. 30 Yoga took postures from animals and are the rules to make you healthy. Disciple means learning how to be healthy. The Lion pose is to build strength like the lion. Meaning of names Bobby May = he may or may not do. Bobby = Baby. The word Joe is a &ldquo;buddy buddy&rdquo; word, friends with everybody. More discussion about names: Adano = I dunno. What is a neutral name? 40 William = William the Conqueror (came to Adano&rsquo;s clinic years before). Liz Metrik and Harry - if she goes by Elizabeth, they are equal. He is a &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; experience. Adano says that he &ldquo;harries&rdquo; Liz. Harold of Hastings went to Normandy to recruit the aid of William, Duke of Normandy, to reclaim his land in England. A monk told Harold he needed a better name. William helped him reclaim his land. The last battle Harold refused to recognize William as his partner. So they had a argument and Harold took off to the land of Hastings. They had a confrontation. Long story short, Harold gets shot in the eye and William declares him King of England, &ldquo;This land is ours.&rdquo; This was because Harold would not pay William for his help. 50 Harold has two meanings: Harry=hurry and it doesn&rsquo;t have stability. It is somebody who constantly harasses you. Herald = to bring in good news. Saint Francis of Rome - She is the Patron Saint of all drivers. Dropped Saint Christopher because the church did not think he was a real guy. Russell means to russell up, to be active. The American Indians don&rsquo;t give a name until the child is 13 years old. Then the child goes out for 24 hours and comes back with a name. Adano tells the story of a boy Adano knew that came back with a grey eagle feather from an eagle he tracked that was molting and he was called Grey Eagle. He ended up taking care of the family&rsquo;s sheep. Yogini = Female unified consciousness (vs masculine Yogi). English does not have masculine and feminine because it started out as a dialect and evolved into a language, which is its advantage over other languages.</p>
<p>Adano00_BiosonicsTonesQ5 - Guy Manners speaking for a minute &ldquo;sound is the basis for form and shape.&rdquo; and the rest are tones from the Biosonics video.</p>
<p>Adano00_ChantsRamDasQ3NW3 - First eight minutes are Adano Chanting: Thou Art My Life, Who Is In My Temple, I Am the Bubble Make Me the Sea, Elemental Song, Door of My Heart, Listen to My Heart Song, and Happiness Runs a Circular Motion. The rest is not Adano chanting.</p>
<p>Adano00_ConceptsofA77Q1NW4 - Rest is timelessness. That is the meaning for the word rest. God is the eternal principle or creative energy is in the timeless state after performing everything that there is to perform in a time state called creation. Creation exists in time. Now, there really is no time as an actual principle. There is the illusion of time in which creation must exist or appear to exist. Now, in this appearance, a unit of time is the distance light crosses the width of an electron, giving its potentiality as a creation. There really is no thing called time. The only that exists is infinite motion to the highest degree of ultrasonic movement. The creator is audible life energy. He spoke before he became the light. It&rsquo;s not a person, it&rsquo;s a principle. &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo; Audible life current that is inside our own bodies. There is music inside of us. He who can see the lord in human form has seen Him at his best. Everything in this relative world is synchronized to time. The audible life current is that pure essence that exists in timelessness. It grants permission to its lower nature, Kal, the time cycle, to make a creation. God is a Sagittarian in opposition to Scorpio in the astrological belt. No matter how Scorpio tries, he cannot overrun Sagittarius. We are Beings of Light. The whole universe started in the sign of Sagittarius. It is the only symbol that is man and animal and the only symbol that is armed to protect itself. It must have the power of life over death. The bow and the arrow is the justice point, the self destructive principle, but at the same time upholding the law. Scorpio can only sting itself or kill you. It can be destroyed by the Sagittarian. Man brought his religion from the galaxies. Alpha Centuri is the galactic center and the Cosmic Life Force is vibrating there. &ldquo;The word IS god&rdquo; that makes all the difference when John wrote his works. So man doesn&rsquo;t search for his soul, man IS soul. 10 You can&rsquo;t take out the ideations of existence out of the universe, though you can change their atomic change. Even Jesus could not enforce a dictatorial dominance over the universe. He had to work by divine will, he therefore was at the right place, at the right time, for the right confrontation at the wedding. The role of the soul living in a time cycle that knows no boundary lines save love. The master obeys the law, but he shows by his love that the law has no control over him. All that time asks us is to face your obligations, no avoiding them. The highest form of therapy for a schizophrenic individual is to fight back. &ldquo;Mother, I would rather do it myself.&rdquo; So involvement is the key word in spiritual growth. Realize your involvement because you are alive and you have a commitment to yourself to face the time cycles and their repercussions. We do not have to reincarnate, we have to resurrect. (question from the audience) Jesus had to be asked. No master will usurp that right though he has the power to crystallize thought because he would be exhibiting his ego. Ego is best recognized as hurrying to do something too fast without waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s dispensation. Watch out and don&rsquo;t eat your words back by being in a hurry. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna do this no more.&rdquo; What do they end up doing the next half hour? Creative intelligence makes us realize that our ego is locked into the time cycle and the time cycle is going to throw us the confrontation immediately to make us face it to eat our own words. So if you are not in a hurry, sooner or later you are going to get the experience. Everything Jesus did could have been done in 24 hours. He was not in a hurry. A Master does not alter the thought patterns of people who don&rsquo;t want to be altered. That setup their own ego and block it. He works with those who are humble and those who are receptive and karmically linked because He Himself is Divine Love without coercion. He&rsquo;s unconditional love. Therefore He wouldn&rsquo;t use the person for His personal gain. He has no gain to have by performing a miracle because there is no miracle to perform. He brings their desires into focus by responding to the time cycle when that desire is supposed to crystallize for them. He knows exactly that split second when it was gonna happen. And if you live the spiritual life you&rsquo;ll notice the spiritual life is photo finish most of the time. Now I&rsquo;m talking from experiences now. Those photo finishes I love you. Adano sings the &ldquo;photo finish&rdquo; song. &ldquo;How I love you, how I love you, my dear old photo finish.&rdquo; But you see photo finish is good.</p>
<p>Adano00_ElPasoQ4NW1 - (Very bad tape). Biorhythms. Rule #1 don&rsquo;t panic, rule #2 don&rsquo;t panic, rule #3 don&rsquo;t panic. Who I am will kill me if I panic because I will think I will be saved, go to heaven and that bull. &ldquo;What I am&rdquo; saved me more than who. What I am is that I am atoms in the form of a tissue mechanism and if it don&rsquo;t breath, they bury it and if it does breath it stays alive regardless of going to hell or heaven. You gotta breath and who the hell would wait for a dead man to show up to torment him. Up your right nostril is god or brother Jesus, up your left nostril is Satan or Lucifer, in the middle is you, this piece of skin. (Ginger laughing). Looking objectively at the sperm getting to the ovum as being a winner. The rich man can&rsquo;t own or possess or own anything. (Gap in tape. &ldquo;This is Sunday.&rdquo;). Solar class discussion of basic minerals. (Gap in tape) 10 More discussion of basic minerals and carbon dioxide being both conserving and breaking down. Host and monitor elements. (Gap in tape) Cooperative and non cooperative guest elements. 18:40 Putting food in at the right time (or blessing it) to avoid the consequences of breakdown. Blessing it is a compensatory action, don&rsquo;t rely on it all the time, blessing food is only good 24 hours. (Gap in tape) 20 Prunes have iron to give you pep to do work and potassium to get you to go to the bathroom. Iron is of value to the tummy in the morning. Spinach, eggplant, rhubarb, grapes have iron in the midday. Beets for iron at night. 30 Tomatoes that grow on trees good with avocado, but not before 11 AM. 40 Gall bladder flush. Watercress and rice gives all 12 minerals. Do not cook things in aluminum, beer is not cooked in the can so this is ok.</p>
<p>Adano00_Flagstaff_DiscussionQ3NW1 - Jesus was a Jew and the servant was a Greek, so the man didn&rsquo;t want Jesus to come to his house. &ldquo;If you but say the word, my servant will be well.&rdquo; The subtle function of physics tells what is going on. &ldquo;Not in all Israel have I seen such faith. Go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Not in all the reality of the &ldquo;is-ness&rdquo; state have there been any form that breathes in the unified field that generates a conviction to the source of its origin until now to confront the Christ principle locked up in form as a request to insulate it against the feedback of the five senses of the sick person that is going to be imposed or abused or criticized by the surrounding community. Here you ask this shaman to come to your house. All these are interplays of the biological fears. When we get down to the atomic physics, we get to the core, &ldquo;go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; This is kinesiology right now. He is healing another individual at a distance by the command. At the atomic level, the servant is healed because he relates to his winning ness principle. The time lapse of the love has no limitation between forms. Pain is a necessary ingredient to stimulate respect and immunity. (Gap in tape). 10 God is a humorous kind of fellow. One person said to me a long time ago, &ldquo;we only meditate on God as man, you mean there is no female part of God?&rdquo; Yes, God is mother too, its a &ldquo;her,&rdquo; its not a &ldquo;ME.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;come let ME make man,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;come let US make man.&rdquo; So there is a father / mother God you see? It is only we who have been educated in this part of the world that think of God as father all the time. We totally ignore that God is both principles. You cannot have a creation with out both principles in it. The male / female or the positive / negative or the passive / active principle. So the scripture is accurate when it says, &ldquo;come let US make man.&rdquo; The word US is plural and man is a dualistic force of positive and negative, male / female, &ldquo;male and female created them.&rdquo; We have the male man and the female man. &ldquo;And God breathed into man the breath of life and man became living soul.&rdquo; But man is the atom, that is the image we are made in. So we say &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; or &ldquo;Atom,&rdquo; the proton or protean man. But a proton is only a part of the atom, there is one part that is constantly spinning out. Scriptures are very symbolic language. The rib of Adam is Eve, which is the electron. When you split the atom, you see the rib action. The orbital pattern of the electron spins around the proton to form the atom. And we don&rsquo;t live in an atmosphere, we live in an atom-sphere. We are an image, this physical frame is an actual image of the cosmic sound and light called God, pure light. Sound and light are the two forces. Light is the passive force and sound is the active force. So God the Father is the active force. The proton always carries the sound in it and the electron carries the light in it. This the yin / yang of the Chinese philosophy too. God is pure light or pure life, which is the neutron which splits in the atom. God is in his creation. The neutron triggers intelligibility in other forms of life to recognize this relationship. The god is me loves the god in you. God has become all. The neutron is in all of us. When you meditate, you look at the point between the eyebrows. The light is shining in the darkness, the desire nature, the cohesive function of the atom. &ldquo;But the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; Within this cohesive force, there is no comprehension going on, only observation. You are also doubting me, which is the darkness. The part that doubts what it hears, Satan, the adversary, the centripetal energy. When the atom is split, something has gone someplace. If you split six pounds of material, only 5.5 ounces are left. How did it get out of the container? We sing a chant, &ldquo;who is in my temple? All the doors do open themselves (endocrine glands). All the lights do light themselves (the energy inside). Darkness like a dark bird, flies away.&rdquo; You are triggering by meditation an atomic reaction in your spinal column, starting the process of spiritual evolution or spiritual expansion, speeding up your spiritual growth. Meditation is to help you realize God all the time, that He is inside of you, not outside of you. The process is to center. 20 Darkness comprehends it now. &ldquo;But let the light so shine before men.&rdquo; Shining with the exact replica of you. &ldquo;You see Me, you see the Father.&rdquo; That is breaking through from the electron level to the proton level, from the light level to the sound level. You will hear the actual sound the proton is making now. The waves are music set to the octave. The whole universe is a musical octave. In the octave, you begin to realize the Christ or the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; of god, the true light of god embodied in the proton, there is where the sound current goes on, the true kernel of your nature. Realization is the whole journey and it has to be inside the human body. There are two lessons, humility through ethical living. Two, the transformation of the animal body, the decaying body, to the non-decaying body that can dematerialize / materialize by divine law, like the caterpillar to the butterfly that never breaks down. To him that overcometh, I will make you a fixture in the house of the lord, an expression of this reality. When this body has thrown off corruption, it is a glory unto the lord. When we drop off the relationship of the electron and become involved with the proton itself, we begin to transform the body itself. Protein comes from the sun. Man used to draw the energy of the mechanism through the medulla oblongata. Man had that ability at one time but then he got engrossed with the electron. Man&rsquo;s body is composed of 16 elements. The atomic physics will verify how many times man has fallen from the protonic nature. As we travel into space, we will produce bodies with less and less minerals in the body. The more we change our environment, the more this body will depend on direct energy and less on solids and liquids. Between teenager to 40 or 50 is the gorge period, but after that it is tapering off. You ever try keeping up with a baby? Their protonic energy is active. The meditation is a technique and a process, not a goal, specially designed for the purpose of conservation of this energy. The advanced approach of conservation is to learn to appreciate solitude and inactivity, so that the body will have a chance to recycles / recharge / revitalize itself. We do this when we are asleep. The waking up is a reinforced thought pattern of getting up. We are far more tired when we are asleep. The spurt of energy comes from having to go to work, etc. 30 The disciples were criticized for falling asleep when they were meditating. The bodily structure wanted to taper off. We don&rsquo;t have to repeat the mistakes they made, we can utilize the feeling of waking up from sleep, and transfer this into a conscious sleep. So you are going to consciously close the eyes and consciously relive the feeling of waking up. You want to try it? Adano leads them through an exercise. 32 Put your feet together with the toes touching each other standing up. Turn the hands the way the feet are, turned out. Elbows into the side. Hold it for a count of 50. Enjoy. You feel loose and limber now? Hold the position until the hurting sensation ceases. It hurts because you are conscious. This is very spiritual. Adano leads a meditation now. (Gap in tape). Adano tells a story of a woman with several degrees who is a waitress. Maybe someday when she&rsquo;s ready to move on to be her own boss, then all those labels will be her presentation for her ability to run her own business. Now she has two kids who are almost 18 now. That is what Adano calls &ldquo;low profile attitude.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s amazing, some people know how to do it naturally. Adano comments on a woodpecker and proper attitudes toward animals.</p>
<p>Adano00_FlagstaffQ2NW3 - Meditation, giving thanks for enlightenment and unfoldment. The audible life stream has become you. Hearing the music and knowing it has become you. 20 Thank you. Any questions? Question: Would you talk about realization, what it means? Adano: In the early stages of understanding, most of us try to get to a state where we think we know and will never be ignorant anymore. This craving is what the eastern people call your delusion. You will continue to feed the fire of the craving to be deluded, but you will arrive at some preposterous, unimaginable place in your awareness thinking you know all there is to know. When it actuality, realization is the acceptance that god became you. According to Paul, after many years of his own internal searching and many unusual experiences over the control of the environments by his thoughts, he discovered how deluded he was and made this remark. &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing for I live and die daily in the lord.&rdquo; Hence he left the room and went to work to be a tent maker and lived for the moment of now by being very practical every moment. Even when he died by giving up his life for his fellow man, he demonstrated the fruit of the spirit instead of the gift of the spirit. The gift is the miraculous power and the tremendous desire to think you know you know. The fruit of the spirit is the understanding that god became you and you cannot become him. Therefore every moment of the now, you are god in motion. You are not a god, you&rsquo;ll never become a god, but you are totally satisfied that god became you. Come let US make man, that is sonics and optics united to make a manifestation with a polaristic process locked up in it. Every moment you accept that realization, you will discover one fact about yourself, you can only live what you say to yourself. You can&rsquo;t take a bath in a blueprint bathtub. Therefore realization is not thinking to become, it is not a blueprint, it is an experiment with yourself. All I can see here is reproductions of self. Love the lord with all your mind, strength, and soul. 30 This marvelous temple is made up of 144 elements and everything else is made up of the same. Love your neighbors AS yourself. Once you let go of the feeling to insulate, that is when the rapport, the unification, and the intensity begins. You feel it like a tingling sensation. The more conscious you are of the tingling sensation, the more you begin to see the whole spirit (Holy Spirit), kundalini, pentecostal, slain in the spirit. You are unfolding in the energy field, biokinesis. Conscious recognition of it. If you look for the simple in the moment to moment, it will always be miraculous. If you keep looking for the miraculous, it may only occur once before you pass out of the body. In the structure of your nature, you have rates of acceleration of your brain representing states of consciousness. Oxygen is the only gas that produces the phenomenon of consciousness. Beta = photographic focusing, eyes are like a camera. Alpha = slowing down the lens, becoming more geometrically specific and not hazy. Selectivity synchronizes to purpose and is very exact. &ldquo;A man is as good as his word.&rdquo; Forced to live your thoughts or they will slam back in your face. 40 Theta = the geometry plays with unfinished actions. We never can finish all our actions, there is always a little left over because we are an organism that must live for tomorrow. Futuristic confrontation. This is the basis of attachment and the cause of all suffering. There we call the dream state. It is necessary to motivate you. You have to program it to replay. Theta is the reservoir of the unfinished dreams in terms of geometry. Delta = the dreamless state, where all geometry disappears in your head. It is blank. Peace that passes understanding. No more verbalization or analysis to describe it to yourself. But that blank is not an end. An end would generate geometry. That blank or peace is a competency or strength. &ldquo;The peace I give, the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; A biodynamic resonance that doesn&rsquo;t have a geometry, but has a vibrancy. The highest yoga is (Adano stands on his two feet and walks). God is for the living, not for the dead. The movie called Cocoon, fixated and liberated individuals. Even after he buries her, he still won&rsquo;t accept liberation. (gap in tape). It is a matter of accepting the christ nature in yourself. As you recognize it, you can exercise it. It has to do with your right to be a being. (gap in tape) 50 Question about the apples decomposing. Adano: First is moldy and powdery and that is the eliminative principle. &ldquo;Creativity energy flowing though me will eliminate all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of the individual.&rdquo; If it retains a little fluid / shriveled up is the dissolving principle. Dried up hard, no powder, no water, that is the strengthening effect. If it remains firm for a whole year and it doesn&rsquo;t collapse, it doesn&rsquo;t shrink, turn powder or watery, that is the rebuilder. Beta = eliminative, alpha = dissolving, theta = strengthening, delta = rebuilding, omega = apple grows, avatar, descent of god into flesh. Seeing at versus seeing through (looking at the subatomic particles). It has to do with focusing. Questions: Is there a particular meditation for each state of the apple. Adano: Meditation is a biological two way communication between the external geometry of the eyes and the internal geometry of the eyes. You have to sit back and listen. The program is already passing through the cells in the four different speeds, so just sit down and enjoy the show. You are the audience. &ldquo;Man must appreciate that he is a witness.&rdquo; 1:00 Close the eyes and watch. Then the levels will start unfolding. You will see the beta / powdery effect, then alpha where your eyes get watery, then theta where you are dreaming that Dracula is biting you, then delta where you enjoy the movie to the full extent, that is the rebuilding effect. Then if you decide you want to start your own movie, that is omega. Then you are living with it for the first time, no guilt or fear or frustration or making up for mistakes. The real anguish is if you think to stay something and it happens, you think you caused it. In actuality, you have lined up the brain to the unified field. E=mc2. You better not think or say more and you keep your mouth shut. And you enjoy living in the world in a simple, rational, humble way. Ability to be practical moment to moment is the test. The next test is how immune is he, that tell us how divine. If the saint and the sinner get the same disease, then there is something wrong in their practice. 1:10 He is not practicing meditation, he is living meditation, but you have to start someplace, so you sit down and watch and use a respiratory function to shift gears and observe. You will experience the sonic resonance and elation of the mechanism due to healthiness. You can live more objectively. The timing becomes obvious to you to act. It is not how smart you are, it is how soon you get through the gate of heaven before it close. It is timing. The summary of the meditative process is the timing of the daily events in your life, regardless if you close your eyes, is the evidence that creative intelligence is directing your survival. Then you are living meditation. Whatever you do will be synchronized to the time to be practical. When is the appropriate time to act. The wise man learns to function with the timing. Once you begin to focus that way, the moments of time will allow you to act.</p>
<p>Adano00_Hoovering1Q4 - All Cymatics sounds.</p>
<p>Adano00_Hoovering2Q4 - All Cymatics sounds.</p>
<p>Adano00_IMEBEQ1NW1 - Pain is essential to develop immunity. If you never had a confrontation, there is no way for immunity to develop. The highest process is to go through it. Pickup your cross and follow me. Each person experiences their own Scope of the Horror and not to be afraid of it, overcoming the unconsciousness of it. You can&rsquo;t become unconscious of the Me in you. The I is constantly reminded by the Me because Be will always be there presenting the bill to I and Me is the bill. So, for that reason, we gain this by the process of going through. When there is no more Me to clean up, would Be be satisfied? Be will not be satisfied, because Be itself would be bored and start again creating an I to give it freedom to generate a use for Me. Me would emerge again from the Be. Come let us make Man in our own Image and Likeness. Be cannot stay stagnant or non-active. Even if it creates I as a form of expression of itself with individuality and complete freedom to squander its existence. Be will forced to generate another Me. There is no way for you to be unconsciousness, non-existing, or non-immortal. When you lock into the immortal ness of yourself, in the I-state, Me-state, or Be-state you are unified, free men or lord of yourself. Health is Be - I - Me. You call it I-Beam, so you light up. Dreams are misfiled data and reruns of Me. I and Be are busy talking to each other in your sleep. The Me is sleeping. Me responds because Be uses it to confront I. Be stores Me and stores I and I has no place to operate in without Be. I could not come out into existence before Be. For that reason, Me is already existing with I and both are stored in Be. Then Be is greater than I and greater than Me, but Be is totally helpless without I and the Me operating in it, even though it stores it, Be would be useless and serve no purpose. Therefore, Be craves exchange and interaction between I and Me. Which needs your Love? Be. 10 Listen, Listen to my heart song. It is Be that sings the song and guarantees the assurance to I that the Me principle is there to back it up. But never I is going to sing to Be. I can forsake Be, but Be cannot let down I. The heart is neutral, the I is the upper part from the cervical to the top of the head. The Me goes from the Lumbar to the Sacral to the Coccyx. The Be is the heart in the center. The real love of God is the healthiness of your Beingness. I breathe, therefore I am. I relate, therefore I retain. I share, therefore I am everything. Then your creativity starts to flow, Be is creativity / self-sustaining. God isn&rsquo;t punching no clock, he is punching customers. And he is resting one day a week. Solar Nutrition - The fifth rule is &ldquo;Live to eat in order to live not to eat.&rdquo; Three score ten is the natural timing for the breatharian transformation. God has individualistic emancipation of society. Each person has their own horoscope. In one lifespan, there are three periods of development in each lifespan. 30-35, 45-65, and 85-95. 20 Abstain, injury situation, or natural progression. The natural progression process is for everybody. There is not other great or glorious contribution to the Creative Self than to live in synchronous harmony with it. I, Me, Be makes more sense living in the Now. 30 When all else fails, follow the instructions. The Garden of Eden is more of a focal point of behavior of Man. It is allegorical. Man had to make the &ldquo;make the mistake.&rdquo; All life forms have a blood type as a reminder process to interact. Macrobiotics found that the chemistry is 80 / 20 to be normal and flowing on time. We don&rsquo;t have years, we have revolutions, so you are endless and youthful all the time, like the movie Cocoon. Intrinsically you are atomic mass utilizing a tissue fold to interact. You are always living in the now with newer, better opportunity of exploring. Andy and Mary (Chief War Eagle), Andy used to say &ldquo;Life is simple, but difficult to apply.&rdquo; No one can see through your clumsiness. You have to work out your own clumsiness. Rule number 1, don&rsquo;t panic, rule number 2, don&rsquo;t panic, rule number 3, don&rsquo;t panic. Just keep muddling your way through. 40 Discussion between people in the room.</p>
<p>Adano00_InvolvementEmergenceQ3NW1 - The inner eye has to be open to understand beingness acting on consciousness and beingness acting on beingness. Now we as human beings can bring ourselves up to the Christ state, or the Master state. We must attain masterhood. We have to attain this state, &ldquo;none come unto the father but by me.&rdquo; We all have to come to that state of development. Then from that state inward, it is God himself, the Creative Intelligence, that pulls us up. We have a physical lift from the body itself and you may find yourself lifting off the ground going through these states or you may see internally how the electrical structure is developed and you go into what is called Moksha or liberation. But this is internal, one can&rsquo;t see this on a physical level, one has to see this on the extrasensory level. You begin to feel the body tingling and you don&rsquo;t crave solids and liquids as much. These are the outward symptoms of the change. A surely of consciousness permeates you. Because the ethical life has to develop before arriving at consciousness acting on consciousness. You judge your spiritual development by the length of time the peace remains with you in a conscious state. When it remains 24 / 7 / 365, you have reached the Christ state. 10 Question: The the Soul leave the body at different times? Answer: Man is Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t have a Soul. The chemical form breaks down, the electrical and causal (ideational) forms remains. The link breaks after 72 hours. Nobody is changed by Christ, they have to make the decision inside. Adano tells story about the man in Canada who was locked up for drugs. It was imposed on him by society to put him in a dungeon. He decided to pray. He eventually gets out after 21 days because he prays for forgiveness. He sees a light come into the room and a voice &ldquo;none come unto the father but by me.&rdquo; The Christ radiated his light into him. His finger prints have changed have this so they cannot prosecute him. Christ met him at the halfway mark. No matter how far you go, you have to make the turnaround. It might be dramatic or subtle, through love. Story of Saint Paul and his conversion. 20 &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why doest thou persecute me?&rdquo; He was doing it with mental remorse. He had internal conflicts in his subconscious mind. Story about Adano falling off the building and the physical body lying there with the electrical / ideational part went out into time and space. &ldquo;If this is death, I enjoy it. There is nothing to be afraid of. I and my Father are one.&rdquo; The Divine Consciousness told him to go back to teach people how to deal with pain. 30 Doctor having to take a different elevator and running into Adano dying on the table and saving his life. God acting through the doctors to have somebody who knew how to help Adano run into him. We have the right to live each moment and have divine life pull us out. Adano saw himself in oneness with everything, God is the Oneness, all the Realized Masters were there and made him realize that he was one with God. He only heard &ldquo;you and I are one.&rdquo; But can I stay here? But the Consciousness said &ldquo;no, you must go back.&rdquo; So then I accepted this, the first rule of the Consciousness, living by divine will. So the test is to go back into the body, that was his choice. If he chose not to go back, only he would suffer, not divine intelligence. 40 (Gap in tape) A Master is not trapped in the lower levels of consciousness. He can get out by remembering one basic truth. &ldquo;He that does the will of the Lord is my brother and sister. And he that follows in My word is My disciple.&rdquo; Following the words of the Master binds us to him through all the levels of creation. We hold back the Divine Principle by avoidance. You sense that your existence is eternal, but you are afraid something will be lost in you if you die. But the strange thing is that when you go to sleep, you do not know if you are a man or a woman. Where have you gone in consciousness? When you terminate physical existence, you don&rsquo;t have continuity of memory, you must reincarnate. It is the last desires that carry over to the next life. 50 You have been cheated of fulfilling your desire when you still have the desire in a baby&rsquo;s body. The whole mind is in turmoil. How do we free ourselves? It takes a Realized Person to enter your consciousness and raise you to the point where you can see this correction. The christ intelligence does this in a realized person. It becomes active at the last moment in the mechanism. There we can generate the consciousness to lock into your consciousness and release you of the desire. The Realized person whispers in the dying person&rsquo;s right ear, &ldquo;The check did not bounce and everything is ok and the Christ in me loves the Christ in you.&rdquo; Helping the individual pass over in consciousness. 1:00 Adano shouting &ldquo;who is dying!&rdquo; to get his consciousness moving. The doctor&rsquo;s had been saying that he was going to die, the bickering made Adano &ldquo;over involved in weakness and over involved in strength.&rdquo; So say positive things in the presence of dying people. Find out what they are holding onto and help them break free of those desires. We can help the individual in these critical moments to break free. Taking full stock of what we are involved with and getting some sense of direction. Jesus saying &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be for me and for mammon.&rdquo; (gap in tape). Jesus going to the seashore when he got too &ldquo;bogged down&rdquo; by people. 1:10 Divine will is to recognize that &ldquo;you are always at the right place, at the right time, for the right experience.&rdquo; No experience is good or bad, but an opportunity to test your behavior. An opportunity to test your attitude that this experience is neither good nor bad. There is only one way to behave, that is to love. (end of Satsang, clapping). Questions and answers. How does man know if he is raising his consciousness. Adano goes through the levels: energy acting on matter. The light shining in the brain. (but the darkness comprehends it not). 1:20 Freshen up with vital consciousness. Energy acting on energy. The saliva will taste like honey / nectar which descends from the brain. Consciousness acting on energy. You can move physical objects with your consciousness. The time cycle responds to you. Story about Jesus turning water into wine. The craving of Mary was strong to have her son do something to impress. She tells the servants &ldquo;do what he tells you.&rdquo; The atmosphere is set with desire. If he had the desire, he would have brought wine, but instead he is satisfying the mother&rsquo;s wish, but still admonishing her behavior.</p>

<p>Adano00_Psalm4ChantsQ3NW2 - Adano explains Psalm 4. Brain emits full potential when eyes are 1/2 open 1/2 closed. &ldquo;Salvation belong unto the lord.&rdquo; Darshan radiates so much love, that 5000 people can be immobilized by the love / spiritualized. They feel like their vitality is going out of them. &ldquo;Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness!&rdquo; That means that the consciousness now responds with attunement when we utilize the right law of meditation. &ldquo;Thou has enlarged me when I was in distress.&rdquo; Consciousness expanded when negative thought patterns were trying to take over. We don&rsquo;t know what will happen when we start meditation. Cold sweats, pounding in my head, trembling, being pulled by the hair roots. When we are partially doubtful and partially calm, so they are afraid to continue and they avoid. David is showing how we should respond in this condition inside, 1/2 restless and 1/2 calm. &ldquo;Hear me when I call.&rdquo; Let me feel that the contact of the inner peace is flowing through me. My consciousness expanded beyond the negative pull when I began to meditate. &ldquo;Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.&rdquo; Let this conscious flow through me so I am competent to handle it and I know without doubt everything is working as it should. This is confirmation that the symptoms that are occurring in us in meditation are real. &ldquo;Oh ye sons of man, how long will you turn my vanity into shame.&rdquo; 10 The consciousness is saying: How long will you go on doubting the possibilities of the experience being genuine and what you think is happening to you is partial and not the real thing. You will try to accept partially, doubting. &ldquo;Oh ye sons of men.&rdquo; Higher consciousness is talking to egos. &ldquo;How long will you love vanity,&rdquo; the unrealistic thought patterns. They are not real, they are like show. How long will you try to seek after temporary conditions are not permanent. All the symptoms of cosmic conscious or god awareness are identical like sickness. There is a difference. Sickness is permanently there, creating a disturbance in your cells. In cosmic consciousness, you have an experience of it knowing that you are master of it. It doesn&rsquo;t affect, you transcend. &ldquo;Stand in awe.&rdquo; Accept yourself and be it (cosmic consciousness). Don&rsquo;t deviate, stick to the path, this is the discipline. 20 You really trust the lord when you are sound asleep. The bed is a sacred spot. Be still as if you were sound asleep. The initiate accepts and lives it out. He doesn&rsquo;t run from his environment. &ldquo;Offer the sacrifice of righteousness.&rdquo; Send up the thought &ldquo;Father, I love you.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t even know what he looks like and you love him. You have to make that particular attempt to turn you on inside. You have to trust the vital life power coming up your spine, kundalini. The science of the souls is very specific. The Psalms show you how to relate and make it work for yourself. Now we have covered the two types of people that exist, we covered the relationship of the government and the system that we exist in, these are in the first two Psalms. In the third Psalm we see now the head of the government has to find inner communion to offset the harassment that we call modern day lobbyism. So we are moving on now to man&rsquo;s happiness is in god&rsquo;s favor. How can inner consciousness gain contentment by total awareness, that&rsquo;s god&rsquo;s favor. The mind is not evaluating in terms of compassion, mercy, and grace, but only in terms of the insecurity. You can&rsquo;t live without relating to a higher part of your being as a supporting force within you. The man of spirituality is known by the fruit of his consciousness and his inner peace. Joy comes from within, not from without. One can have a bumper crop and still be discontent, but the joy you feel everyday is entirely different. It spreads out through your entire being and it starts in the heart center. There you hear the bells ringing inside, when the heart chakra opens up. 30 If the huge mastodons were here, what would have happened? They would have kept multiplying. Nature has a way of maintaining the balance. &ldquo;The meek will inherit the earth.&rdquo; Who will survive? The strong, or the weak, or the meek? It&rsquo;s the meek. The humble, attuned, synchronized to live itself is the meek, and he survives. He is accepting divine law. We are not here to run from the world, we are here to live in it. But only by living it can we understand it and understanding is the highest thing you should get if you are going to get anything out of spirituality. You can&rsquo;t carry riches to the grave. Death is a condition, if you understand it, you surpass it. Death is your last opposition. So are supposed to be free, in charge of this mechanism. Pituitary is the mental microphone of the mind. Broadcast, &ldquo;father I love you.&rdquo; This is the greatest mantra. Real meditation is a flow of love. 40 Total consciousness does not entertain negative living. It will fall apart. Jesus says &ldquo;call no man fool.&rdquo; There must be a reason for this, a karmic debt. Clown is a different thing. When you say a man is a fool, that is a different thing, you are cutting the very vital life principle, representing the creator, and addressing the creator as a fool. The consciousness cannot stand the fact of destruction by its own volition. Though it has the desire to destroy itself at times, but even then it cannot stand the fact because it is committed to repeat the principle all over to test itself. It will have to go through the process of learning again. It has to come back in another body form to learn out the mistake of killing itself. When we look at ourselves, to be happy, it must come from inside. 45 Chanting begins for the rest of the tape.</p>
<p>Adano00_RebirthingGuidedMeditationQ3NW3 - Adano guides the group through letting go of birth trauma through color recycling, &ldquo;first month, second month, third, fourth, fifth, six, seventh, eighth, ninth, the doctors are working, cutting the cord, and you are breathing in pure joy through your lungs.&rdquo; Black, grey, etc. indigo, violet, then changing into white light. &ldquo;Like a fog off the brain, light a weight of the chest, shoulders, etc. All through the toes, ankles, calves, kneecaps, thigh, hips, waist, chest, shoulders, necks, arms, top of the skull, the whole body is feeling the joy coming up.&rdquo; Yawning. &ldquo;You are the breath. You are not the body, you are the breath in and around the body, coming in and going out.&rdquo; 10 Yawn. Feeling freedom. Yawn. Equi-flowing now. Feel your oneness with the breath, existence, conscious, joy. Energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared. You are one with the chair, the floor, your breath, the entire room, the environment. Every sound becoming one and you are the container. Feel it coming up the spine. 20 Adano tells Bill Lockridge from El Paso that he was very steady. Modern man needs the equal flow because he is constantly driving vehicles and put into the survival decision making, so he needs the living in the now more than the agricultural man. 27 (gap in tape) Feel the air around your skin. That air blowing against your skin is creative love, sustaining the universe. Within that air there are many gases and they all have different fragrances. Only one sustains the consciousness and all the other accentuate our quality. The more you feel the warmth of the air, the more the love is intensified in your body. Feel all the texture of the skin relaxing, absorbing and nourishing itself from the air. You are nourished directly throughout the entire surface of the body. (meditation follows). Between you and the realized ones, the feeling of the air on the surface of your body. 40 (still meditating). 53 Yukteswar says, &ldquo;get up and sweep the floor.&rdquo; You can get lost in the drunkenness of peace. The joy of now, but the more you recognize it from your saliva, the more you are actually living on that ambrosia. That&rsquo;s why the ancient Greek gods lived on ambrosia and nectar, Mount Olympus is right here (probably pointing at the point between the eyebrows). This principle is flowing up in the saliva and oxygen that comes in to activate the whole form is the catalyst and the tongue that is designed for resonance of sonics is the bridge between the gas and the biological chemistry setting up the flavor in the mouth. Moving the tongue around the mouth releases the enzymes. You can tap into the enzymic process in the body and have the cells replenish themselves in the conscious level instead of the unconscious level of sleep. It is basically within the whole organism, but we don&rsquo;t look at it this way. When we understand it, we have access to the reservoir of all the truths that the ancient people were trying to teach.</p>
<p>Adano00_Solar1Q4NW1 - (must be in the 1980s because Melissa is talking around 15 minute mark.) Blood types and learning to cope with them. Put protein in first. Middle of the day, beans and rice are a complete protein. Seeds: sunflower, sesame, pumpkin. Type B or O have a piece of beef or lamb (less toxic). A little apple cider vinegar to reduce toxicity or a little wine (for the stomach&rsquo;s sake). The brain does its own self alignment through the silence level between 3-5 AM since the Earth exposure to Cosmic Rays before dawn. 10 Monotone (color) environment to slow you down and cope with routine better. Husband as confrontation reminder for the father. You can&rsquo;t tell Dad off because he pays the rent. Necessity is the mother of invention, the daughter is boredom. 20 80% alkaline, 20% acid. If you use a flesh product, always get some malic acid in your system to phase / flush out uric acids. Two teaspoons apple cider vinegar, two teaspoons honey, 8 oz distilled water. Drink two glasses per day. This allows you to be safe from the effects of the uric acid in tissue. Dextrinized bread doesn&rsquo;t make you tired. 30 Ghee made from heating butter and separating it. Two types of cholesterol in butter: white = insulator, yellow = lubricator. Ghee is better than meat to insulate and builds up bone marrow. Story of sugar, originally beet, but British found cane easier to grow. White sugar was originally for kidney disease (India / China), the brown sugar (rock sugar) was meant for eating. Yogis discovered white sugar good for restarting kidneys. Honey is neutral. 40 Cashews should be roasted. Other uses of cashews. Coconut oil is a saturated oil, ideal for massage and cosmetics. Mix it with plantain and breadfruit and it acts like a soybean oil and doesn&rsquo;t clog up your system. Cashews need to be cooked. 50 Potato should be cooked since it is nightshade family. Mushroom should not be eaten raw, can cause fungus in liver. Asparagus - cook it. Tooth therapy to keep teeth from falling out: swiss / cheddar / monterey jack, clove of garlic, slice of onion, and a little parsley. Then drink a little aloe vera juice or chew it with it.</p>
<p>Adano00_Solar3Q3NW2 - Trace minerals for kidney time, iodine working in both shut organs. In the middle of the day (from pumpkin seeds), at night (seaweed). Sea salt also has natural iodine. Selenium, iodine, zinc, and chromium. Zinc and chromium are in the same color spectrum with mercury and nickel. People with mercury fillings usually both people in the evening (6:30 PM). If you have a tooth problem, swiss / cheddar / monterey jack slice with clarified butter, garlic, and honey, and aloe vera and parsley. Copper affects spleen and heart. Gold / silver affects the small intestines. Arthritis comes from clogging of small intestine. If you eat meat, then put hot sake over it to take out the uric acid and reduce the arthritic condition. Marine life oils neutralizes the condition from animal fat and reduces arthritis. Aluminum is found in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It is also a trauma mostly for men and these are men who have been promised a retirement plan and just prior they lost it. Real mental trauma. The brain would not accept failure. Most of these people went into a shock pattern. 10 If you are focusing on a goal, then you are going to be let down. If you are focusing on the process, then you don&rsquo;t worry about what happens tomorrow. 9 times out of 10, it is the person punching the clock that has the problem. The more you cater to the process you will stay healthy to take care of your obligations. The process holds up itself. The trace minerals have another condition that we need to know. Taking it in a liquid form is better than other forms. Body toddy is the most natural source. Iron and Vitamin C go together very well. Tomato juice and molasses have this combination (in the afternoon). In the trace minerals you will also find opposite the organ there is a trace mineral setup to correct a problem in that organ. Lead is opposite to the spleen in thyroid area and the spleen has arsenic so if you phase down arsenic, you would need a trace mineral containing the opposite, lead. The final food that would compensate, a nighttime food such as ginseng or fotea (sp?) that would phase down arsenic or aluminum. Your major trace mineral is iodine, so as long as you keep iodine up, the other trace minerals can&rsquo;t have an effect. 20 Diabetics need to take a lot of trace minerals to stabilize, such as thyroid trace minerals. The bulk of people are hyper, not hypo, so they need something to slow down. Yogis have mastered the understanding of breath from umbilical to breathless state (not breath-free). That is the purpose of meditation, is to feel, holistically / osmotically integrating the oxygen. So they call it cosmic consciousness, able to see in all dimensions. Totally oxygenated, from head to toe, all the time by an osmotic process. Nitrogen moves the muscle, hydrogen creates the desire, nitrogen gives you the willpower to stick it out, oxygen let&rsquo;s you observe it. So you observe yourself craving to stick things out. You have carbon dioxide as a residue build up. It was a value at one level and a threat at another level. It will refrigerate you and preserve you or it can over refrigerate you and traumatize you. Less air is called the breathless state, from the nostril to the skin. The trace minerals are the transporters, working osmotically under the skin. You have the 12 basic minerals, the basic geometry. Yogananda used to pray to learn to live on cosmic frequencies, less and less on the solids and liquids. 30 Fasting causes the body to breath slower and tingle. In meditation, when you close your eyes you are trying to sense cellular osmotic absorption in your body. You can feel it like a tingle. 32:22 So here we have the right to eat on time by the light, the right to eat by lunar because of the pressure, and the right to eat anytime and bless it. But don&rsquo;t eat anytime and don&rsquo;t bless it because it will muck you up. (Comment from a student, &ldquo;But Therese Neumann knew the physics.&rdquo;) The thing is this, you learn the physics not from a school or a book process. After working with your body it becomes so obvious that they puzzle, &ldquo;where did you get your knowledge?&rdquo; You begin to see the phenomena is working through you. Your mind begins to zero in on it and then if you want to go validate it because you suddenly discover this wealth of awareness of yourself, you will find that most of the data is written in some book, but never put down in a way to comprehend it. So they are actually experiencing that today now. Adano explains Physician - Heal thyself as &ldquo;Physics I Can - Heal Self.&rdquo; You are the can that contains the physics and through your I-ness you can correct the flow of these elements in the cell and the osmotic approach is the direct interaction with the timing. Timing of iodine, stored in the thyroid. 40 Spitting when you get really mad so you don&rsquo;t have to swallow the enzymes. Then it will start sweeting up if you leave the mouth open and shake it up, then swallow it. We are getting more to understand the physics of ourselves. Working on people based on colors, but working on them at the right time of day. First take the age and go back. Age 35 equals 8 years, what happened at that time of life. Adano tells the story of his trauma at two years old. Individuality is god&rsquo;s costume. We are the individuality as the form or geometry, and we provide this entertainment for the unified field as the breath, the unified principle. The breath is the unified principle, outside / inside as oxygen all over the place. The one that creates awareness, not intellect, consciousness is like a camera, it records and plays back. The consciousness is universal. 50 If it is occurring in a mature body, it would be more indicative in the geometry. Mediation is a means to look at the thing more maturely. The more you correct it yourself, you are operating more efficiently. You are not avoiding mistakes, situations are opportunities to learn how to make a mistake, not to make a mistake, and not to feel threatened by not or making a mistake. Freeing the mechanism from  making preconceived assessments of a situation and getting locked into it. The moment you are working with determines what you are going to do. Adano explains the recent Chinese &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo; Then they have to discuss or a coup is the next stage. This is how the human brain is setup. 30 years to muck up, then the rest of the years are recycling years: 31 is a 4, 32 is a 5, etc. Adano tells more about his traumas a child, then falling off the building in 1955 as a way of working out early traumas. The body knows to correct itself if we allow it.</p>
<p>Adano00_SolarAtHoustonClinicQ1 - The first rule of Solar Nutrition is a little of anything is medicine for your system, too much is toxic. I will underline anything and toxic. And the person responsible for this statement is a guy called Confucius. The only problem with it is that a little for you is not a little for me, each person&rsquo;s little is different so we can&rsquo;t trust the word little, we have got to me more specific in terms of measurement. That&rsquo;s how come we find out research goes on today, what &ldquo;little&rdquo; fits everybody. So we can&rsquo;t say a little will work, we have to be more specific, if is a gram, milligram, or half a gram or whatever it is. That&rsquo;s what makes it work. 2:00 The second rule, there is a time, a place, and a season for everything and I am going to underline time, place, and season. The time has to do with your health. Your whole body is regulated by time. There is no way you can get around the timing when it comes to health. What you eat and when you put it in keeps you health, but when you put it in is more important. The place also regulates your pocketbook, if you are in the wrong place you will go broke. You can do anything you like, but you won&rsquo;t make it and in the right place, everybody wants to give it to you so that&rsquo;s evidence of fact. So they say &ldquo;go west young man&rdquo; and &ldquo;go east young lady.&rdquo; The man goes west and he&rsquo;s a cowboy and the woman goes east and she is in the chorus line. If you go north or south you may get stuck so it depends where you want to go, but that&rsquo;s the place. And the season, there is no such thing as season, there are conditions of nature so zero degrees moving forward to 32 degrees is a condition called winter, 32 degrees moving forward to 75 degrees is a condition you call spring, 75 degrees moving forward to 100 degrees plus is a condition they call summer, 100 degrees plus moving backward to 75 degrees is a condition called indian summer, 75 degrees moving backward to 32 degrees is a condition they call fall / autumn, and 32 degrees moving back to zero is a condition called winter. 7:15 The third rule is &ldquo;live to eat to get sick.&rdquo; See, that&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way. If you don&rsquo;t eat to get sick, you don&rsquo;t appreciate nature. You would be very egotistical and bombastic. So nature has rules and laws designed to make you respect her. One, there is only a certain length you can stretch you leg before she will snap it. There is only a certain amount of food you can put in your tummy before she busts it. There is only a certain type of food you can put in there before you vomit it. She is very smart so she knows how to make you sick. When you like to show off and put it in and think you can outdo nature with your mind, but nature runs your body. She doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot what kind of mind you got. Mind over matter, that&rsquo;s a bunch of baloney. It used to work years ago, but it don&rsquo;t work no more. Because why? You think you got a big mind, you are going to prove yourself and then your body lets you down and they bury you. 10 Live to eat not to get sick. Then it gets boring and you eat to get sick again. So the fifth rule is &ldquo;live to eat in order to live not to eat.&rdquo; A caterpillar is doing that, eating its way to a cocoon, then a creature comes out that can fly, a butterfly. &ldquo;Of all the creatures that can fly, there is none more beautiful than the butterfly.&rdquo; Butterflies do not rot and that principle is locked up in your body. Eating is a method to prepare you to live without eating. Because you &ldquo;process&rdquo; food and not &ldquo;eat&rdquo; it, you have to go to the bathroom. Don&rsquo;t confuse the mass you put into your mouth and the mass that came out as being evidence that you ate the food. The mineral contact of the biggest food wouldn&rsquo;t fit into the tip of a pinhead. You have 30 years to muck up, 30 years to clean up, then the rest of the years are yours. Three score ten is the transition time (70 years) to living on direct energy. Direct energy is sound waves which is breathing. 20 Mastodons carry their babies until they are 93 and lives 900 years, turtles live 100 years. Dinosaurs take 1,000 years to hatch. Moses took the scarab design off the walls of the pyramids. Early human left this design on the pyramid walls to remind people of their origins. The human body is a time traveler designed like a spaceship, but something was missing. It only showed the calcium distribution, but they left off the ambulators. From the top of the skull to sternum is the first layer of calcium formation (Zone 1), the second is from the sternum to the top of the pubic bone which is the lumbar region (Zone 2), and then from the lumbar to the anus or coccyx is the third (Zone 3). These regions are synchronous and Carl Jung is the first man to recognize this when he said the archetype is the pattern that sets the blueprint for the life form. You need the five requirements to stay healthy in your body: protein, carbohydrate, mineral / vitamin, liquid / water, lipid / oil. Needed for every meal in each of the three light zones. After high school you have to stand on your own two feet. From 18 - 30 years you can &ldquo;muck it up,&rdquo; the oriental calendar rat to the pig. 30 Each light zone must have Vitamin C and relate to the types of sicknesses. If you have a chest cold, tomatoes for lunch. Vitamin C in the morning is orange. Solar Nutrition is broken down into two functions: 21 days before the full moon = The Solar Cycle then three days before the full moon, the full moon, three days after the full moon = The Lunar Cycle. To summarize Adano: Three days before the full moon &ldquo;move the clock forward&rdquo; Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch. Three days after the full moon Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast. 40 &ldquo;Automatic, cruise-o-matic, cleanup.&rdquo; On full moon day anything goes. The reason it works is because of the pressure of the moon on the earth and you go to the bathroom quicker. The next thing you need to know is your blood type. A and AB can be 100% fiber eater, total vegetarian. B and O can be 100% tissue eater, meat eater. But nature didn&rsquo;t intend us to be 100% anything. Yogananda said that he was a &ldquo;proper eatarian.&rdquo; To stay healthy, you have to be 80% alkaline (fiber-fruits and nuts, vegetables, grain, etc.) and 20% acid (tissue, fish, eggs, etc.). Too much of either can make you sick. The balance between the two can make you healthy. The best tissue is the lamb which has the least toxic. 50 The cow and the pig are very toxic when they are killed. The lamb&rsquo;s blood before getting killed is toxic and after it is not toxic. &ldquo;Lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world.&rdquo; The deer is good also (for the hunter). Night time tissue is fish and egg. Male and female are worms and eggs. Male sperm is the worm and female has eggs. The egg ate the worm. A person with arthritis can eat lamb, fish, and eggs and get rid of it. You must know your blood type. Litmus (nitrazine) paper under the tongue. 6.5 to 7.5 is normal. Below 6 too acid, above 7.5 you are too alkaline. Acid person has a runny nose, full of mucus, always spitting up mucus, tongue is white and coated, hacking cough, and skin cracks with a yellow fluid coming out, and you ache. Also can have red spots on skin. Alkaline person has a pink, cracking tongue, dry cough, skin is very dry, cracks without fluid. Alkaline cancer is possible. When you are eating on time, you are alkaline. Melissa Wolf gives people a kinesis test. 60 Eating it and blessing it when you don&rsquo;t know is the saving grace offered by Jesus. But when you do know, you don&rsquo;t abuse it, you utilize the correct knowledge and if you have to use it outside the cycle, then you bless it. 1:05 Tape changes and Adano leaves, talking in the restaurant where they get pie. 1:10 Adano talking over breakfast to Roger Warden and a couple other people. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with the positive, the negative is powerful too. Anytime you slip back into the negative, you are going to get it, full blast. If you correct the positive with your mouth, what do you think you are going to do with the negative? The days of the play is over my friend. You are a passenger no more, you are the driver. Planet earth and the sun has moved in the last 20 years around Alpha Centauri therefore what you will be saying in the next 11-12 years will be crystallizing both positive and negative, faster and faster. In 15 years, Adano will be 80 (so since Adano was born in 1924, this implies that this tape was done in 1989). It&rsquo;s physics, it&rsquo;s not devil, it&rsquo;s laws of physics. That machine (the video tape recorder) was put together by physics. (In the video, Adano looks into the tape and looks through time.). Cooperation and doing it &ldquo;their way.&rdquo; Then tape changes again. nighttime now and people are talking over dinner. 1:20 Adano tells the story that he was born while his parents house was burning down. Miscellaneous conversation. Somebody chanting Nityananda Guru, Om Guru. Prismer music. Roger Warden tells the story of going to the dumpster at 3 AM and throwing away his smoking material. Adano says &ldquo;What are you worried about, you don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo; 1:30 (Somebody says that tomorrow they go on savings time, so the day must be April 1, 1989). More miscellaneous conversation. 1:33 What Jesus said was fact, &ldquo;but the Father in me doeth everything.&rdquo; That includes the thinking and your holding on to what you think you need and even what you think is your breath, that is His still. He is teaching you to be receptive and stop trying to run the show and enjoy the show, but he has given individuality and because he has done this, individuality is a freedom that allows you to kill yourself. That&rsquo;s why there are only three tests, kill to eat, kill yourself if you don&rsquo;t like it, or try to possess everything to be on top of everybody. That are the three tests that Jesus mastered in the desert. More miscellaneous discussion over a meal. The oxygen is pushed into us between 14.6 and 14.7 psi. The Russians and the Americans are getting ready to go to Mars so they will have to share their knowledge to do it. We have the launch power and they have the ability to keep &ldquo;the internal contents&rdquo; functioning better. 1:40 Big executives must have one hour twice a day in anti-stress rooms by using sound and light waves to deactivate the stress. Breath-less does not imply slow, it implies less repetition with longer pause between inhale and exhale. It is being done to you. Breath-free is not Breath-less. Breath-less is a condition of less repetition with longer pause in between. The period begins to run longer and the quantity per minute is reducing to compensate. Napoleon only breathed four times a minute. He thought it was a disease, it was an asset. But he did have some kind of problem that made him a tyrant, a dictator, imbecile, like Hitler. 1:45 God has a strange way to use a human body to make it stand out among society to mold it. We wouldn&rsquo;t have England today and other parts of the world if there was no Napoleon to mold it. It would stay in a corner and hide itself, but because Napoleon came along and did lots of things and forced the Russians to be somewhat more independent, so these were necessary things. Prana Yama was the old agricultural language based on compulsive guilt. We have to move onto what it is actually doing to the human being and what was it for in the first place. 1:50 Society fools itself by trying to make everybody equal, so the process was setup for individualistic realization / freedom because the Creative Intelligence has no intention of going out of business before midnight eternity. No master answers questions for the masses, it is for the specific individual&rsquo;s life frequency. It doesn&rsquo;t apply to a group, only to the person asking the question. What is all the knowledge in all the books compared with 15 minutes silence in yourself. But you cannot find an S-E-L-F, it don&rsquo;t exist, but you can discover 15 minutes silence, that is no electromagnetic static action in the cell. Which gives the experience of looking (Adano gives darshan), where everything is about to get transparent. And you think you are getting schizophrenic. They call it Darshan, full sight, and it is oxygen. (Adano demonstrates). Story about Yogananda going into the body of the soldier who got shot. Story about Trailanga Swami from Autobiography of a Yogi. Discussion of Prana Yama breathing. Prana means life and Yama means conscious relationship, not control. Consciously relating to the oxygen around you. Feel it, let is go through your skin and travel through your body. (train goes by with horn blowing and Adano is giving Darshan) Even the train is telling you. Now can you draw the energy of that sound into your body and feed yourself (Adano does it). That sound just gave me enough energy to go back to work without having to eat. Now you are recognizing what I am talking about. Don&rsquo;t try to steal the air. Feel the oxygen on the skin. Now you notice that your breakfast has all gone out of your body. Anytime you burp you are getting rid of the traumas. Let your eyes get oxygen. Now you notice the feeling is very clear, very centered, there is no stiffness.</p>
<p>Adano00_SolarQ3NW1 - Iron from the prune, iron from the almonds, piece of kiwi or peach. Kiwi is higher than vitamin C than orange. Almond will bond with citrus vitamin C. These all grow in Zone 1. The organs in Zone 1 are very important, especially the lungs, the preferential organ. 3:30 You need a little acid and you need a little alkalinity to be healthy. It is not 100% acid and it&rsquo;s not 100% alkaline, it is 80/20, you have to have the balance. That&rsquo;s one of the emphasis of macrobiotics, the acid / alkaline tone because modern science is hammering it away because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so obvious in the chemistry, but the time again regulates its beneficial results. The kiwi has more vitamin c than the black cherry. The kiwi and black cherry will absorb iron into the blood, but doesn&rsquo;t have citric acid to phase off the mucous. Citrus phases down quicker. If you are running a race, start the race drinking apple juice for malic acid, but then the lactic acid builds up, so you have to switch into a citrus juice that will phase down the lactic acid. Adano tells the story of the runner who kept losing races until Adano told him what to switch to orange juice in the second lap of the race. The sugar content of the citrus fruit is like &ldquo;high octane.&rdquo; 10 I had to prove it to myself first. The minerals and vitamins are brought into the body by the fruit, especially the skins and seeds, but then it is the oil. In the morning, get the three vitamins A, B, and C (most). C is the anti-toxin vitamin. Need to know what the vitamin C is made from. Corn Vitamin C can cause a clogged up stomach. Acerola cherries (best) or rose hips are the best &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; vitamin C. Don&rsquo;t just take the pills, has to mix with the saliva. I prefer to eat six meals a day, a small bowl of nuts, prunes, kiwi, cherries carries you through from 7-9. Then 10-12 you have orange juice as vitamin C backup, but also hormone balancers since we also run on hormones, not just food. Folgers coffee, not Maryland Club, mountain grown, one cup only with a teaspoon of Hershey&rsquo;s baking cocoa and maple syrup to sweeten. These three, taken around 10 AM is the hormone balancer. Take it in at spleen time for blood sugar regulation. Spleen and pancreas are interrelated. Hyperglycemia people have high blood pressure. Get irritable at spleen time. Hypoglycemic people have low blood pressure and get sleepy at that time. Hyper type can get diabetic, hypo type can get hypoglycemic. The cocoa comes from a cocoa bean, the coffee comes from a coffee bean, when they come in contact, the caffeine has no effect when mixed with maple syrup. A heart attack is lack of oxygen. (if they die at 1 PM in the afternoon). It can also be a lack of carbon dioxide. (because of gall bladder, if they die at a quarter to 1 AM in the morning). Story about the woman who died because she was given oxygen when she had an attack in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Adano00_StatementofLoveQ1NW1 - Saints and Sages of all religions. Brother Jesus, be though present and bless this meditation and open the hearts of these loved ones, free their lives from all obstacles, and bless them with the physical, mental, and spiritual unfoldment and may thy love shine in the sanctuary of their hearts. Bring them from the darkness to the light, ignorance to the truth, bondage to freedom, the impractical to the practical, the unconsciousness to the conscious. Release within them peace that passeth all understanding, Om, Shanti, peace. Repeat, Om. Adano does each 3x with people repeating after him Om coccyx, Om sacral, Om lumbar, Om dorsal, Om cervical, Om medulla, Om master, Om christ, Om master, Om medulla, Om cervical, Om dorsal, Om lumbar, Om sacral, Om coccyx, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, etc. 8 Godliness is practicalness, you will discover that for yourself. That&rsquo;s why this gathering today is not a religious gathering and the friends that have invited me here are friends. I love you, but I&rsquo;m not in love with you because to be in love is to fall out of love and then I&rsquo;ll blame myself for making the mistake, but to love you, we have a wonderful relationship, wonderful communion, very unending, very rewarding. That&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Adano00_TucsonQ4NW1 - The aging process is the inoperative behavior of the structure on time. Time is the distance light crossed the width of an electron, therefore the unit of time is measurable by action, conductance divided by resistance. We function in a time process, but we carry a ruler to keep track of it, it is called a watch. You are a light process and the rhythms of your light process are set. Transformation of carbon into the diamond and alchemy. Alchemy means &ldquo;all the elements&rdquo; but it built a philosophical structure to describe the mechanics of the 144 elements. But that label is not appropriate for today&rsquo;s time because it carries with it a sense of guilt. Chemistry doesn&rsquo;t have guilt, but the same laws and 144 elements are there. The reaction time is what we are dealing with constantly. If you are lead, you feel guilty that you are not gold. Al-mond means all the world, the 12 basic minerals that make the human body as a food, the most complete food. The physical body is in three rates of acceleration, the chemical rate, electrical rate, and the magnetic rate and they are all setup with chemistry. That&rsquo;s why solar nutrition takes food into the mechanism on time. We came to this country because we didn&rsquo;t have anything and our self enterprising nature pushes us forward. 10 Whenever a scientist makes a breakthrough in data concerning his environment, he is going to have to alter language from a guilt level to a non-guilt level, from a generalized level to a specific level, and no one is going to like him. 10 But if he doesn&rsquo;t freak out, he might be an asset to society. Ancient people used certain techniques to break away from environmental programming like mantra or repetition. What they are trying to get at is integrative part of your beingness where the creative reservoir is functioning totally unlimited like a fountain of youth inside of you. Freemen or lord of your cells. Adano sings, &ldquo;enjoy yourselves, it&rsquo;s later than you think, enjoy yourselves, you&rsquo;re never going to be pink, the years go by, they&rsquo;re always full of drink, enjoy yourself before they stink.&rdquo; This is nature&rsquo;s greatest contribution to creation, but it is taking us time to come to grips with it. We are moving out of churchianity into human dignity which is called spirituality. Churchianity had to mold itself from primal consciousness, from its agrarian heritage it was valid, but it isn&rsquo;t valid when it breeds sickness in the form of guilt. We have to come to grips with the reality that we are beings here for the purpose of expressing creativeness and therefore it is taking the laws of physics and chemistry to break away from that all inclusive frame, to let us look at ourcells for the first time without fear. I have one mantra, it is called Maha Asana, I will demonstrate it for you. Adano demonstrates. You see it, you heard it, it is called standing on your two feet. Delta has two functions, the first function of delta is this, Adano snores, the other state of delta is to get up and function and the moment of function is the moment of contribution. You are applying practicality. Delta doesn&rsquo;t have anything to offer other than to release, it releases what you have. It is the non ego level. Deep down inside of us is the urge to do something constructive. We are programmed to feel unworthy, once you begin phasing that off and begin to look at yourself actually the way you are constructed, free men or lord of your cells (yourselves). Delta is the observer, you paid the money for the movie to come on the screen. Yogananda story about seeing himself on the battlefield being shot in the chest. We have this phenomena going on in us because we are an expression of light. 20 The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second and the earth is 8000 miles in diameter. Adano explains carbon dioxide and oxygen and how it links everybody together with the speed of light squared. 22:22 Paul came to the final realization that the miracles were not the essential purpose of life, understanding the truth is the real purpose of living, how to function in a guilt free state. So he said &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing, for I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; Meaning he was able to phase in and phase out on the cosmic tape called oxygen that produces the phenomena called consciousness or identity which made the intimacy of self beingness, worthiness now, the greatest joy. That was his rejoicing for the first time. He was rejoicing in self beingness. Whenever you do something that doesn&rsquo;t please the parent, they are going to remind you that you faltered. After awhile you get a sense of worthiness or unworthiness. But deep down inside, unworthiness also exists when the sperm are released to the ovum. You don&rsquo;t know if you are going to be a winner because nobody asked you to run the race. The struggle goes into the biological memory banks to determine the willingness to survive. You wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in this room if you weren&rsquo;t a winner. Adano explains twins and siamese twins as two sperms who did not slow down sufficiently to dock with the ovum. The creator has to put himself in all these different individual mechanic to test the love. Why is he testing love? Because he is endowing the creation with love. He creates us. We are created in this process and love is the principle that drives it to create therefore it has to endow the creation with love and give it a sense of worthiness, but a sense of worthiness is never appreciated unless there is a sense of competitiveness. You see it. You can&rsquo;t have a front without a back, a top without a bottom. This is a necessary means to develop immunity to cope with the environment. 30 So every law of nature is well worked out. We have to come out and live it at the intellectual level and assess it with the intellect. So you need your intellect, your programming, to evaluate the biological laws. Here is another mantra at the intellectual level, &ldquo;prayer unceasingly.&rdquo; Breath is only prayer because it makes a sound in the inhalation and exhalation called So Hung, Adano snorts. &ldquo;I am that,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the sonics resonating in the nostril with the incoming / outgoing air.&rdquo; When you begin to understand the truth behind it, you have to live the mantra by breathing. You disengage from the childlike behavior and get into the actual mechanics to live now. The mantra phases down beta to give you control in alpha, then it phases down the alpha to disengage you from the discordant geometry that is not stored correctly by memory tissue. You may say something and not take full note of it and that&rsquo;s where you have the responsibility for the actions. Repetition is an ingrained process for discipline. You can also chant or shout it or maybe mentally think it. Each individual finds his own idiosyncrasy, like Frank Sinatra, &ldquo;I did it my own way.&rdquo; You must find what is intimate to your nature and apply it. You will get the same result in the end, that is the delta level, totally devoid of geometry, alphabet, and numerals, and the strength of the inner consciousness. That is the level you are heading to. The paths are many, but the truth and the experience is still the same. Then you have to get up and live it.</p>
<p>Adano00_UmarkedQ3NW1 - Holding the little finger up while drinking tea is &ldquo;wearing their love on their sleeve.&rdquo; That connects to the heart, they are very vain people and controls the small intestine, they don&rsquo;t eat too much. Gap in tape. This finger controls circulation, sex drive, and elimination. Now this finger controls the lungs. Body language is already preset is already indicating how these forces are working inside. 2:20 We are so close to the experience of oneness if we can just program the mind to work with simple techniques. The oriental people have learned it so they use a candle, or they use a picture, or they use a photograph, something to center. And you say &ldquo;I want to merge with the Master.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the common term you use? &ldquo;I want to be one with the Master?&rdquo; It is the same as saying I want to be one with the little flashlight. The image has nothing to do with the inner experience. The inner experience is a bridge between the physiological will and the psychological will in order to experience omnipresence which is a sense of oneness or at-one-ment. This is also a feeling of outside-ness of your body. Yet you are never really outside. Because outside of where? You have always been outside, but you were looking down and trying to hold onto this, calling this the reality, but when you break the illusion of the psychological level and see that &ldquo;hey you&rsquo;ve been free all these years and never knew you were free,&rdquo; but dreams are the only way to help you to remember that you are free and most people get dreams that they are always traveling someplace, flying someplace. This is to remind you that you have always been outside. So don&rsquo;t block them, the idea is to recapture them and start focusing them. Adano explains physiological will and the psychological will based on Hatha yoga postures. 10 Adano tells the story of the composer who can see the energy flowing up the body. Adano explains the flows of energy in the body and the alpha machine. Long silent periods in tape while Adano demonstrates techniques to people. Sounds like Margaret is talking about the elemental song and singing it 16 times for all the elementals in combination. 20 Margaret fumbling around with the relationships between the elementals, interrupting Adano. Adano explains pressure in the body pulling downward and upward on the colon. Ascending colon not flushing lung and large intestine to block up. Descending colon not flushing causes spleen, liver, and stomach to block up. It has to be kept clean.</p>
<p>Adano00_Xmas_CosmicConsciousnessQ1NW1 - Adano gives a talk with an organ in the background. Come, let us pray with the deepest devotion of our souls, Om Brahma, Om Vishnu, Om Shiva, etc. Our beloved Jesus Chris, Supreme Master Babaji, Great Master Lahiri Mahasaya, Master Swami Sri Yukteswarji, our beloved guru Paramahansaji Yogananda, and the saints and sages of all religions, we bow to thee all. May the Light of Christ Consciousness flow through us as it has manifested in thy life. Open the doors of consciousness that we may perceive in this incarnation the universal christ consciousness throbbing within our hearts. Bless us that we understand the truth and feel thy love and may thou love shine on the sanctuary of thy devotion that we may awaken this love in all hearts. Om, Christ, Gurus. 0:05 Good evening folks, we are gathered here tonight, myself, Sonny, and Al to wish you a Merry Christmas. At the same time to participate in group meditation. I would like you to join us and commune with Christ. 6 I want to tell you something very important tonight and that is how to see the beloved Jesus within ourselves. You may ask, how do you see a person? The answer is the eye. The eye is constructed like a camera. It has a dark chamber, a lens through which light is admitted, and a sensitive plate through which the light acts. In the human eye, the sensitive plate is the retina. Light acting on photo sensitive chemical substances in the retina creating impulses that are transmitted to the brain which interprets them as visual images. When you hear a sound, it too is converted into touch. You not only hear, but you feel it also as vibratory sensation. Similarly, light does not go into the brain as light, but acts on the photosensitive cells of the retina. The result is a chemical stimuli activating nerve impulses that travel to the brain and are converted there into mental images having form, line, and color. The retina is actually a thin out pocketing of the brain around which the eye has formed. In fact, when you see a person, you are not seeing him, but a photographic image. The power of vision is in the brain, but if the brain is anesthetized, you cannot see anything. Even when you become absent minded, your brain does not respond to the impulses coming into it from the retina. You are unaware of outer happenings. Many years ago, our guru Parahansaji, when he was a young boy, happened to be in a state of Samadhi or divine ecstasy. His uncle was so alarmed that his uncle struck him in an effort to arouse him. Master heard him saying &ldquo;what is the matter with you? I struck you three times, but you did not respond.&rdquo; Master was so deep in concentration, he had no bodily sensations. His mind was so focused on god that all sensory perception of his uncle&rsquo;s presence and his slaps failed to register. 10 We seen then that we must have some form of contact and that is where the eyes are important. The eyes act as a two way camera. It photographs images from the outer world and also images from the subconscious and superconsciousness realms, the electrical nature. Our waking mind or conscious mind, reacts to retinal impressions. Observing images, objects, persons, that are in line with the vision. How then may a person see Jesus? This is the question tonight. We who have lived and have read of Jesus who has lived thousands of years ago would like to perceive him, not as a mental image, but the body of Jesus and the bodies of all saints who have lived on this earth plane and were immortalized in Cosmic Consciousness, God. It is possible and the Great Ones can appear before us anytime. 11:30 More so tonight, which is dedicated to Jesus. 12 How do such visions occur? There is a definite science to it. The technique is to focus your eyes at the Christ Center in the forehead between the eyebrows. When your eyes are upturned in this way, you shutoff the awareness of outer lights. Gradually, slowly, you will begin to see another light. This light is of a bluish color. Where does that light come from? It is the astral light of the brain, the electrical nature of man, that issues from the pineal eye or gland and the medulla oblongata. And that is reflected in your spiritual eye in the center of the forehead. This is the single eye of which Jesus spoke of when he said &ldquo;if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&rdquo; As you gaze at the point between the eyebrows slowly focusing the mind and thinking of Jesus, we will begin to see that it takes shape. 14 Now we know, that in order to see an object with shape, light is necessary. One cannot see in the dark, therefore all Saints saw in visions in a state of light, not physical, but astral light. It is necessary to shut of your physical vision first. To achieve success, the half open eyes have to be concentrated at the christ center. In order to see the astral light, you must focus your eyes at the astral center, calmly, without strain, relaxed, with deep concentration and devotion and in that astral eye you evoke the image of Jesus. Our Guru has seen Jesus many times. Jesus has olive skin and dark brown, his nose if flattened at the tip, his mustache, hair, and sparse beard are black. Keep your whole attention on that light in the spiritual eye. Don&rsquo;t try to visualize his appearance, but silently generate the thought at the point between the eyebrows mentally saying, &ldquo;please come to me&rdquo; and continue with devotion, &ldquo;please come to me.&rdquo; From that cosmic source, that light of god will materialize around you. He will first come to you as a small image and as your power becomes stronger, it takes on the full form. 20 When you open your eyes fully, the vision will vanish. You will have to try harder to see him when the eyes are open. These experiences are tremendous, but can be only achieved with your deepest desire and love. So meditate until you make contact. The blessings of the guru and the grace of god is with us tonight. If you don&rsquo;t see Christ right away, you will feel him. 25 I have been telling you this whole evening about Jesus and how to contact Him, but what is more important is the object of communion with the Christ Consciousness. For centuries, from Jerusalem to India, this earth plane has been hallowed by great souls who have all brought the same one message to us, that is the message of Self Realization, the Christ Intelligence which manifests throughout vibratory creation. A person cannot know of Jesus merely by reading a book on theology, scriptures, he must feel the presence of Jesus in deep meditation, he must have an experience of Christ Consciousness throughout vibratory creation. We must learn to seek this spiritual solace in the inner, immortal temple. 27 Let us enlarge the cup of our consciousness so that the Christ Consciousness can fill us and quench our Soul thirst. As we behold the Christ Consciousness in all individuals, families, races, creatures, we must finally experience Him in the spinal Christmas tree of the bodily temple. There we will discover the Star of Wisdom, the omnipresent Ever New Joy, the Cosmic Sound, Cosmic Light, Cosmic Vibration, Cosmic Wisdom, and Cosmic Love. Every year and every moment, the Christ is recognized in Cosmic Consciousness and the angelic beings all celebrate this glorious manifestation. Let us now celebrate this Christ Consciousness in our own meditation. Let us prepare the Christmas tree of the spine and let us place the eternal gifts on this beautiful spinal tree. The gift of eternal consciousness life, unconditional love, unattachment, service, understanding, self control, and self surrender. And as we place these gifts on the spinal column of the great cosmic Christmas tree, we behold the Cosmic Christ Consciousness permeating us in a golden, blue white light, flowing through us and around us and may this Consciousness lift us up that we be living examples of these glorious gifts and as we permeate our consciousness, not the physical body of Jesus, but the glorious Christ Consciousness that is in all creation, we will then participate of these glorious gifts that we feel in the spinal Christmas tree in the bodily temple. Om, Christ, Gurus. 30 Oh beloved Jesus, I surrender my ego to thy consciousness. May thy blessing flow through me to all these holy ones. As I touch them on their forehead, my thy blessing flow to them, granting them permanent Christ Consciousness in this bodily temple. And may they feel thy presence and behold the many masters who have made us conscious of thy presence. And may we live in this glorious consciousness and participate with this blessing. We thank thee. Om, Christ, Gurus. Adano stops for a moment, gap in tape. 37 Somebody else talking 40 Adano tells the story of Yogananda&rsquo;s life. Babaji, the Supreme Master and Avatar made this statement years before Yogananda was born. &ldquo;I see that you are interested in the West as well as the East.&rdquo; &ldquo;East and West must establish a golden middle path of activity and spirituality combined. We have much to learn from the West in material development and much to give in universal methods to the West in order for them to base their religious beliefs. You Swamaji have a part to play in the coming harmonious exchange between the East and the West. Some years hence I will send you a disciple whom you can train for Yoga dissemination in the West. The vibrations where of many spiritually seeking souls come flood like to me. I perceive potential saints in America and Europe waiting to be awakened.&rdquo; You see Master&rsquo;s life was preicted way before in a conversation between Supreme Master Babaji and Sri Yukteswar. Story about Yogananda praying for approval to go the West. Babaji came and gave him approval. This is all in Autobiography of a Yogi. gap in tape then somebody else talking. 50 Still somebody else talking. 60 Adano talking again. Beloved Master, perceive this great Cosmic Experience by gazing on the Supreme Master Babaji. Now, Master himself craved this experience to be a permanent thing within himself. Sri Yukteswar bestowed the divine experience of Cosmic Consciousness. The divine experience does not come by intellectual willingness or open mindedness. It descends through the enlargement of the consciousness and by devotion and through the natural inevitability of a divine nature, the student pulls at god with irresistible force and the cosmic vision is then drawn down within the seekers range of consciousness. Adano continues with stories from Autobiography of a Yogi. 1:00 Somebody else talking, the Samadhi poem. 1:10 Adano talking from these cosmic experience that it is possible for us, the disciples to daily experience this cosmic experience. As we close our eyes and gaze at the point between the eyebrows at the Christ center, slowly expanding our consciousness and beholding the golden light, the blue, the cosmic white star radiating, feeling our presence, traveling through our entire bodies into our rooms, the four walls. Beyond the four walls expanding to the very boundaries of our community, to the boundaries of our countries, and to the boundaries of other countries, expanding throughout the entire earth. Our consciousness is expanding to other planets, stars, galaxies, the entire creation. As we behold this cosmic chalice, this cosmic holy grail being filled with the divine spirit, the divine nature. We shall drink daily as we see the cosmic light and hear the cosmic sound and feel the cosmic bliss permeating our bodies and taste the cosmic nectar in our mouths and smell the cosmic perfume. Then we know, beyond all doubt, that we too are experiencing this glorious cosmic consciousness to which the master Paramahansaji came and brought the beautiful techniques for us to experience them. We shall daily commune with our cosmic nature and drink in this holy spirit. 1:10 Adano plays Yogananda&rsquo;s voice reciting &ldquo;God, Christ, Gurus.&rdquo; Oh beloved Guru, Paramahansaji, I surrender my ego to thee. May thy blessing flow through me and through my hands and to thy beloved disciples. And may they feel thy presence when I touch them on the forehead with thy consciousness. May that consciousness flow into their consciousness and permeate them. We thank thee.</p>

<p>The Cherokee word for soul is ada:n(v)do. It’s semantic meaning, deconstructed from its root, ada nv a, indicates that someone or something is in transit, moving from place to place. This transitory vision of this mutable and mobile essence has its origins, according to Fogelson, in the aboriginal Cherokee belief that four primal animate life forces emanate from the human body.
