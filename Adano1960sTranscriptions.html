<p>Adano65_1RecordedfromVisitQ2RRNW6 - (Inaudible chatting). 0:04 You see the whole thing is each one of us is like a little spark and then as the spark gets bigger by exposure to other sparks, before you know it it becomes a flame. Now eight or ten years ago I don&rsquo;t think anyone was ready for these men, they wouldn&rsquo;t comprehend what they were going to teach but then again you need a sort of a movement prior to their presence or prior to their coming to sort of lay the groundwork, lay sort of a challenge in ourselves. So we had what we call a beatnik movement, we had the hippie movement, and now we have what is called gelling of this consciousness, we find all of the students in the universities are all reaching out to really explore themselves for the first time. Well as long as you have these men living and demonstrating this capacity, you find being exposed to that particular prior movement you have something now to compare, before you had nothing to compare, you see? I don&rsquo;t know of you folks know Marlow? He had something to compare between meditation and going to an Indian meditation on the reservation and for the first time when he was exposed to it, he saw what meditation was and then after he saw that, then he had something else to compare, he saw how to go past that. Before he met the Indians on the reservation in their way of meditation, it was all book in the mind you know then the little experience of meditating together. Then he went to the Indian meeting on the reservation and he saw the two, first it was a struggle to sit down for 10 minutes, then the exposure from eight o&rsquo;clock at night to eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning everybody is sitting down trying to meditate on the reservation, you can image his tremendous (inaudible), let alone sit down for 10 minutes in your own home. Here are these people coming in the middle of the night you know, strike up a meeting right away (inaudible). Then after that he was able to compare and then he met Ananda Moi, he shot Ananda Moi questions to get going. I think he sits down to meditate for an hour or two. Marlow&rsquo;s thing is this you see, since he was training to be a Jesuit monk (inaudible), you see the monks have a form of preparation to organize their mind by&hellip; that&rsquo;s why they have in these monasteries little yards, they walk up and down, you see them pacing the yard. This is actually to bend the mind to concentrate, didn&rsquo;t know why you know, they&rsquo;re doing it as a part of rote system, it&rsquo;s not really understanding they&rsquo;re doing it, then you find that they have a sort of practice in which they try to focus their mind but he was doing this as a monk, when he was training as a monk then all of a sudden he got sick and couldn&rsquo;t go any further and then he came out from the monastery but he was still searching for something, he did not know why he was searching, he became exposed to understanding himself within then he started to see the relationship. Now from the time I met him (inaudible) struggled to meditate and then all of a sudden to be exposed to people who live on a reservation for hours they&rsquo;re meditating, this is a kind of shock to the body you know and then come back and evaluate, compare, (inaudible). 0:10 You see he had three comparisons: One, he had the comparison of walking up and down because he was forced into it as a kid and he lived in an environment to satisfy the parent, this is one of the comparisons. Then when he got sick he came out and kept searching then all of a sudden he ran into us and our system is strictly to sit down and calm the mind. Well this is a new thing because it&rsquo;s not so easy to do then he runs into exposure to people on the reservation who resort to a psychedelic process which is peyote and they resort to a psychedelic process to enter the state. Now he has something to compare but having no knowledge of what really occurs inside, he was handicapped to compare. You see with all his intellectual and book learning he had no way to compare what really went on because he never did practice meditation from within, it was only meditation from the book, you understand? What really occurs inside is a different thing altogether, you have to shut all that out and really get inside. Well from that exposure to see these people really acquiring some peace of mind but not really getting to what they&rsquo;re going after and then he saw the devotion, he saw the simplicity but at the same he saw the disadvantage but he didn&rsquo;t recognize the disadvantage. The disadvantage was that although these people were achieving the extrasensory awareness, it was not staying with them in a permanent state, they were not able to hold onto this thing after they came out from their meetings and Sunday mornings everybody was able to greet each other, brother and sister, then take off and the thing is finished, you have to go back next Sunday. So they realized that this thing is not staying with you, you have to keep this thing going, then you&rsquo;re starting to rely more on an external agent and there is no volition control now, you are not employing your will you see, there is no real concentration. This is the challenge because the will is the real thing that you are after, you have to develop the will and without it, there is no real control. Like the morning after the first meditation, go back and meditate and stay there until the will push you out, right? Now from the experience you see now that the will did it, until you get hold of the will and let it organize it, then intuition follows after. You see that is why you would understand the symbology of why Peter wanted to be crucified upside down, no one really understands that symbolism in Peter&rsquo;s life. See Jesus is the symbolism of pure intuition, direct perception from within oneself, free from repercussion of thinking which is called the Christ state in Man. Everyone strives for it, it strives to realize itself which it mean attain or attainment or illumination. Now Peter was a demonstration of dogged Will, &ldquo;upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; It is upon concentrated Will that intuitive consciousness has an opportunity to regulate life outwardly before it can regulate it inwardly. You have nothing else to regulate you see, we cannot regulate it by sheer feeling, you have to regulate it by Will and this is why He says &ldquo;upon this rock,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s upon this fact that the Will governs everything, but not ego Will, it is the universal Will in things, that is the dynamic pull of life on you that holds you up together, that&rsquo;s why the scriptures would say, &ldquo;there is no thing in this universe that can move except by Divine Will.&rdquo; So there is no portion of our mechanism as a human being that can exert some form of movement or control except this Will. Now Will is a combination of desire plus energy. You must have some desire, some intense desire, and you must generate some form of energy because you are an example, a living model of consciousness and congealed energy in the form of matter, but the trick of it, what we call Maya or the relativity of it, is how to recognize it. The only way you can recognize this is when you can stop the feeling, the pull of the feeling, and watch it and then you realize if this person is agitating you or aggravating you, &ldquo;come let&rsquo;s go out and have a Coke, have a burger, let&rsquo;s go do this&rdquo; and you say &ldquo;No I want to stay here, I want to stay here,&rdquo; you want to bring the mind back to hold it, but then you find gradually it will obey, but you can go and have that, you still come back. That&rsquo;s why Jesus would say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you eat that will defile you, but what comes out of your mouth.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not so much that you don&rsquo;t involve yourself with your feeling, it&rsquo;s the fact that you may lose your ability to regulate your Will through your feeling, you see. If you have the power to regulate your Will, you control feeling, but if you don&rsquo;t have this power then feeling regulates you and this is what we don&rsquo;t want to develop in the early stages of our growth. We want to develop Will first in order that the pure feeling, the true feeling, eventually you&rsquo;re going to arrive at pure feeling, which is pure consciousness, but this pure consciousness / pure feeling is something that only comes out after the Will is developed. Now as I said Peter preferred to die upside down. Now this is the reason, Will eventually when it&rsquo;s developed, contains a certain percent of Ego in it, it is never free totally from the ego because remember it requires a certain desire pattern to drive it, it has to have this desire pattern to drive it otherwise it would never move, this wouldn&rsquo;t move from here to here unless you have a desire pattern, you see, but because you&rsquo;re involved as an individual with the desire, you&rsquo;re involved with ego you see. Now if you feel the thing move without exerting physical energy, then this thing will move too, that is proven now in the power of telekinesis which is the same time is to prove &ldquo;if you have faith in Me in a grain of mustard seed and you say unto the mountain move and the mountain will move.&rdquo; This is a law unto itself to understand how Will can be free from ego, most of the time, a great portion of our existence, Will is involved with ego, until we surrender this Will and accept Divine Will, that&rsquo;s why you find all the great Masters would say &ldquo;not my Will but the Cosmic Will be done. Not my Will but thy Will be done or the Father&rsquo;s Will be done.&rdquo; In other words as long as there is ego in the Will, intuition never has a chance to control our life, but as soon as we surrender this Will, and that&rsquo;s where the word discipline comes in, that&rsquo;s where the feeling of obedience comes in, the first law of existence, as soon as we surrender it, it takes a great challenge because it&rsquo;s not so easy, it&rsquo;s too involved with the material body, too involved with desire, it&rsquo;s too involved with personal likes and dislikes to surrender right away, you know what I mean. That doesn&rsquo;t say that you should not surrender it, that doesn&rsquo;t say you totally throw everything away just to fulfill this surrender, surrender is something that comes naturally. You&rsquo;ll naturally feel this thing leave you, you&rsquo;ll naturally feel the desire and the ego leaving the Will. 0:20 It&rsquo;s a funny phenomena, it comes on its own and you cannot feel that under drugs. What you will feel under drugs is a suspension, a sort of a &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m a helpless being. I stick in the hypodermic and the pain don&rsquo;t exist no more.&rdquo; So volition is shut down, it&rsquo;s sort of a semi-paralysis of the organs, but as soon as this wears away, back comes the condition, but when this suspension of will comes in, it is like the surgeon has taken a cosmic syringe now and stuck you with some kind of energy in there and it totally cauterizes everything, it will never come back no more. It is totally shutoff, no matter how you try it&rsquo;s all cut out, somebody cut it out of your system and you&rsquo;re free, this is a different thing altogether, this comes strictly from your meditation. So it is like being turned upside down, all of a sudden you think to yourself you&rsquo;re no longer pushing with your head to do things. In other words relaxing and everything is being done for you, strange thing, everything is turned around for you, for the first time you begin to recognize everything is falling into place and this is the realization because when you recognize things are falling in their place for you without even applying too much effort. That&rsquo;s why they say, &ldquo;Now Divine Will is moving in your life.&rdquo; So you have actually performed symbolically within yourself the truth of the upside down crucifixion of Peter, the cauterizing of Will and allowing intuition or Christ-ness to come into you, flow you see. So strange but not until that occurs in us can we be free and yet we need Will, it&rsquo;s strange, it&rsquo;s a paradox, we need Will so much to enforce a certain level of understanding and have to arrive at this level, we have to tear it all down to get the other level of understanding. You say why would we start right at the beginning in this way, you see, and get it, and then the great Masters would say &ldquo;unless you have something to compare with, how would you know?&rdquo; So climb up the hill, slip down back on your knees, before you get to the bottom somebody will pick you up and brush you off and take you up to the top again and that&rsquo;s what the Masters are for exactly. They want us to scale up and bruise up and get scarred up by the time we get to the top &ldquo;is there a Master somewhere to help pull me out of this&rdquo; and this world is all crashing in on me. Well, let&rsquo;s crash, it&rsquo;s a funny phenomena, you can&rsquo;t really crash, you never really crash, the feeling that we are crashing is that inwardly we see the futility or feel the futility of struggle, we don&rsquo;t know why. This is one of the peculiar things of our consciousness, not to know what you are doing or why you are doing it builds up such a tremendous anxiety in us that automatically we are bound to collapse. Now that is really where the core of the fear of existence, there really isn&rsquo;t no fear or reason to fear, it is the unknown quantity X that keeps us agitated, why we are struggling and not getting results, why why why why. We don&rsquo;t realize that actually we are only living, it&rsquo;s like a seed growing, why can&rsquo;t I eat tomatoes right away when I plant it, why do I have to wait so many days before it grows to eat it, you see. Now why can&rsquo;t I do this right away, well the Masters will tell you you can&rsquo;t because mastery takes so many upteen lives to, sometimes many many incarnations even to get past a certain point and yet through intercession and many little virtues they can (inaudible) their part. So you ask &ldquo;is it worth it?&rdquo; The question is not if it is worth it, the question is &ldquo;can I stick it out?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not if it&rsquo;s worth it that&rsquo;s important, can I stick it out, what really is what I&rsquo;m trying to stick out in the first place? I&rsquo;m only trying to stick out the value of human life as a human being, consciously. You see none of us would be aware of the true nature of our existence consciously if we were never exposed to it through another human being. Now I think Emerson says, &ldquo;the moment I get out in nature, nature herself makes a Brahmin out of me,&rdquo; in other words the mere fact of the magnitude of creation wherever you are makes you feel so small, shrink you down so much, that you begin to think of &ldquo;why should I go back into that hustle, bustle out there for a lousy few bucks a week when I can sit back here and enjoy all the beautiful trees and&hellip;&rdquo; Well then we start to see that quality coming in, then the Masters would say &ldquo;yes that is true, it&rsquo;s good, but that is only one portion of the evolution,&rdquo; then you find out what is the other the portion, the other portion of my evolution is I get back in the hustle and bustle and under the stresses and strain of everyday living this consciousness is working through the Will, I&rsquo;m tugging, but you&rsquo;re proving now without exerting too much effort, the laws of life are responding around you and you are proving now the other half of your nature, that the Universe was made for Man and not Man for the Universe. You have no opportunity to prove that to yourself unless you live with people, the Saint knows that, the great Masters know that, that&rsquo;s why They get back with people. They first find themselves in solitude, then they get involved with people because this is where they have to live out the other half of their nature. Now if the Universe was not made for Man, let&rsquo;s say Man was made for this Universe, then none of us have to meditate, and I&rsquo;ll show you why the Universe was made for Man and not Man for the Universe. If Man was the first act of creation, then Man would have to do his own creation of trees and animals to entertain himself or feed himself. He&rsquo;d have to create a planet to live on, he&rsquo;d have to create his own atmosphere to survive, he&rsquo;d have to create his own Moon to give him light, and he&rsquo;d have to create his own Sun to sustain him, but if you look at it, Man was the last act of creation, every other thing came first before Man so everything was made for him, so Man is an important creature. He transcends everything because if everything was made for you, then you are heir. My father and my mother in their own consciousness would say we have to have a son or a daughter so we gonna get married and then prepare and they&rsquo;re going to try to save some money, build up a business, and when we get old we&rsquo;re going to leave all this for our son in that he would have a better life, and just throw ourselves back to the year 1760 somewhere in Europe under the persecution of different tyrannical and there&rsquo;s a great country across the ocean called&hellip; what do you call it? &ldquo;Oh they call it the Red Man&rsquo;s Land, yeah America, just discovered by some Spaniard I hear from Genoa, I hear honey that&rsquo;s the land of promise, the streets are lined with gold I hear, let us go.&rdquo; Here are two bright eyed people in their early 20&rsquo;s and they see this glorious vision and they grasp it, but who are they grasping for? They&rsquo;re grasping for their offspring to have something better than them. That is the same principle applying back into us, who is this Creator creating this Universe for? It&rsquo;s in order that He could revel or have magnification in a human body, He has no other opportunity, otherwise if we were all living in the pure etheric body we wouldn&rsquo;t choose this specific planet with all the sickness to come and exist in it with all the problems, we would go to some other beautiful planet, but it is a great challenge, this great intelligence puts us in this physical body to try it out, experience, we need it. As the one student asked one of the Masters one time, &ldquo;Master, why are we getting all these UFOs.&rdquo; And the Master said &ldquo;Well they&rsquo;re coming here and we&rsquo;re going there, that&rsquo;s how.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;it has been going on long before you come to recognize it as a UFO.&rdquo; The thing is they&rsquo;re talking about Will you know, one of the greatest truths of this will is, well look at it this way, the Masters are really in a sense Masters of life engineering. Now remember Jesus never taught Christianity, Buddha never taught Buddhism, Mohammed never taught Mohammed-ism, Confucius never taught Confucianism, Lao Tzu never taught Lao Tzu-ism, yet all these Masters, even Nanak and all the modern day Masters, all teach one basic truth, fully thing, they all have one common thread of knowledge, yet when the student picks up that thread from wherever he comes from, right away that thread is classified by the teacher&rsquo;s name, you see, and then the thread of truth is lost again in dogma, in organization, then somebody starts a new revivalism and this is the universal law of life, that truth is exposed occasionally, periodically in its pure sense, by the human form, and then by the human form it is adulterated so that the human form will come back to reestablish it, like Krishna, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come again and again to renew the right of life.&rdquo; Unless we can understand that, it&rsquo;s like Jesus says, everyone is expecting a second coming of Jesus, you don&rsquo;t realize that the Man was saying in the first place. The Master Jesus came already in a physical form, illustrating in His body form among a particular group of people of a particular culture, the qualifications of Master-hood, yet He was not fully recognized in it. In fact, one Master went to say He only had 12 disciples, what a poor selection for a Master, only 12, not to be recognized by His people, but it&rsquo;s not numbers we&rsquo;re looking at and in fact out of the 12, the 12 didn&rsquo;t even get realization until He left the body. The one who was not even a disciple got the realization from the Master and this is the oddest thing, there were so many different things that He did that people didn&rsquo;t understand it, but to really appreciate the Master Jesus is when you start meditating you start to see the whole picture of the life, then you start to see the impact of what the Master Jesus was doing. He was a Master of life engineering. Today doctors are going into little bits of it, you know they&rsquo;re giving it new names: biology, physiology, psychologies, none of us know how to practice swim-ology. You ever heard the story of the philosopher that went into the boat with the boatman? Audience: Kriyananda? Adano: It&rsquo;s philosophy versus swim-ology. We do not know how to swim the river of life through conscious feeling and conscious will, therefore we are stuck in the mud of resistance. That&rsquo;s actually where we are, we&rsquo;re stuck in the mud of resistance, we&rsquo;re constantly battered, yet if we can swim through it, we&rsquo;re free, and this is what the Masters of life are teaching us, life engineering, or Divine Light, is the art of behavior. If you have this art permeating you, you can swim this thing because you&rsquo;re moving from one aspect of life to a higher aspect of life, but you&rsquo;re not going anyplace in the sense of the word you&rsquo;re going to some place you know, the only real place you&rsquo;re going is here, HERE, and the only real feeling is NOW and the only true action is JOY or aliveness, the fact you&rsquo;re alive you know and everything has texture, you can actually smell it, you can reach out and squeeze it, you look at everything and it seems to pulsate and then you know &ldquo;I AM ALIVE!,&rdquo; I am a being, I&rsquo;m not a dead rock. Audience: Adano, these two (inaudible). Adano: (Laughter) This is the living feeling, you see first it&rsquo;s feeling and then type of feeling slowly dissolves into Will and that Will dissolves eventually into pure feeling. You see feeling in the early stages does not produce or make you conscious of texture in things, you would not be aware of the texture of things, true vision, or the mere fact of sensing that it&rsquo;s pulsating, but then comes the Will because you want to break that shell, you don&rsquo;t want to be pushed so all of a sudden you find you&rsquo;re withdrawing to solitude where that is the focusing or controlling of Will now, you&rsquo;re drawn the develop this Will and then this Will starts to get agitated to a point between what you want to do and what somebody wants you to do and you make a break and then you find you come to a point where the feeling actually comes back now and when it comes back you (inaudible) start to see now. Actually you begin to see texture, you feel texture, it&rsquo;s a funny thing, you can taste texture, everything is that texturized in life, it&rsquo;s pulsating as if you can actually inhale it too, then you know you are experiencing true experience of that statement that the Master Jesus said, &ldquo;I,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean Jesus now, &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; self awareness is approaching its full expression through you, &ldquo;that you may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; Self-awareness is opening up in you for you to experience the reality of life vibrating around you fully for the first time, you are really ALIVE, alive to the point of bursting, there is no boundary lines now for this feeling and the Maharishi if you ever meet him, he&rsquo;s bursting with joy, the mere fact that he&rsquo;s alive, the JOY of living, the Ananda, existence, pure consciousness, but what is it for? If you exist and if you&rsquo;re aware of your existence, you don&rsquo;t want grief, you don&rsquo;t want anxiety, you want JOY, but joy is aliveness, joy is NOW, HERE. Whatever you&rsquo;re doing, no matter what it is, you&rsquo;re doing it with the fullness of joy. In other words you are building up a bank account of joy, your own personal bank account of joy. Everyday you put a little penny of joy inside and it keeps building up, building up to the point where it&rsquo;s just bursting out, everybody just feels it going through them, vibrating as sort of a giant washing machine, agitator, everybody gets agitated with joy and then you understand now why the early father of democracy in this country said &ldquo;the pursuit of happiness.&rdquo; 0:40 But pursuit is quite a little off in its nature because you can be pursuing happiness and still not catch up with it, you see, and then the race becomes only the race, it&rsquo;s not really realization of the race. It is more of the understanding happiness than the pursuit of happiness. See pursuit is like chasing something you&rsquo;re never going to catch or something that is eluding you, you see, &ldquo;in hot pursuit of the sheriff behind the gangster,&rdquo; the posse is in hot pursuit, it&rsquo;s chasing something. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s more of the understanding of your nature that&rsquo;s happiness. You know today songs are being formed, &ldquo;Happiness is a brand new Cadillac.&rdquo; Happiness is. Truly you go back to the poet who said, &ldquo;Happiness is nowhere to be found, but in a contented mind.&rdquo; But again we start to see that that is not true in it&rsquo;s real nature because when you have to live that experience you&rsquo;ll find out it&rsquo;s slightly off as a feeling. Happiness exists as a feeling in the contents of mind because you don&rsquo;t know what mind is. You use mind to perceive and when you perceive, you retain the perceptions or the things perceived in that reservoir of mind and it&rsquo;s out of those retained experiences you get the happiness from because you have to relive them constantly. So people say &ldquo;I relive certain memories, some are good, some are unpleasant.&rdquo; The unpleasant ones, well after a while they cease to be unpleasant, they all become good memories. So we learn &ldquo;that was a good show,&rdquo; it was a good movie, &ldquo;boy did I ever fall from a tall chair and come down on my back.&rdquo; It was a good show but while it was happening it was misery, then you start to see where happiness really is. Happiness is the fact that you can look backwards into one&rsquo;s own reservoir of experience and see the relationships, you see now there&rsquo;s nothing there to be afraid of, there&rsquo;s nothing there to resent in the first place. While it&rsquo;s happening to the physical body in the moment, the shock, there&rsquo;s the resentment, there&rsquo;s the fear, there is all the aggravation, yet when the period passes on, you start to see there is no such thing, it&rsquo;s pure happiness all the time. Now again in the scriptures, &ldquo;All these things come to pass,&rdquo; but they left out one statement, yes all these things will come to pass in your life, but not to stay. They don&rsquo;t stay. Can you recall any memories that is keep staying with you? Let&rsquo;s say you have an automobile accident, is it going to stay with you all the time? It&rsquo;s gonna stop sometime, you gotta sleep sometime, right? Ok, you have a brand new article, it&rsquo;s gonna fall down and break, but sometime you gotta sleep, it will pass out of consciousness, till you wake up again and you start activating it, but every time it passes out, it&rsquo;s gone, temporarily suspended till it wears off the effect. Audience: Louise wanted me to give you this book. Adano: Thank you, tell her thanks from me. Let&rsquo;s have some incense burn&hellip; Sita&hellip; Ram, Ram, Sita, Ram. See Ram or Rama was the personification of God in Man as the ideal husband and Sita was the personification of God in Woman as the ideal wife and I think the part of the Ramayan that showed this ideal relationship was when they were in exile, she said to him, &ldquo;Permit me Lord to walk ahead of you to clear the path of thorns, to rub thy feet, so I may glean the glow of thine eyes.&rdquo; Now imagine what this woman had to do for her husband to clear the path of thorns, she would have to walk on them first, this is quite a challenge and the ideal husband part was he saw she was abducted and there was no stone unturned that he did not try to find her back. Then the last minute with all this being accomplished, he was in doubt (inaudible) because when he returned from the battle and he got his wife back, he was always worrying was she a faithful woman, this is a peculiar nature in Man too and he had to overcome this and in that woman chose trial by ordeal, you ever heard of trial by ordeal, to prove her love for him. On two occasions she chose fire and walked unharmed through the fire to prove her love was genuine and on the third occasion she chose the earth, there&rsquo;s were the word furro comes from, seat of the furro. She returned to the furro which she came from, she walked into the earth and Mahakali the earth opened to accept her and instead of the earth remaining open for her to walk down so her husband can see, she looked at her husband and smiled and she called the earth to close back over her. In that way he realized the sacrifice of the woman&rsquo;s love was so great that he was able then to break what is called the last vestige of doubt in his mind as to the fidelity (inaudible). Ramayana is a very great book if you can understand because not only from the standpoint of the epic, from the standpoint of the hidden laws that are written there. You see Sita was never born of man or woman, Sita was a result of seven drops of blood from seven great Rishis and she was the adopted daughter of King Janaka. 0:50 You see there was a chant that goes Ram, Ram, Sita, Ram and all throughout India they keep chanting this. Ram in its ideal state is God in Man as the ideal husband, Sita is the ideal state as Woman, this is a very great truth and you never hear the word Ram Sita Ram, I said it like that before, right, the chant is Sita Ram Sita Ram Sita Ram, it&rsquo;s always Sita first before Ram. As they said in the story, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go before my Lord and clear the path of thorns and rub his feet so that a glean of light would shine into my heart.&rdquo; The chant is Sita, Ram, Ram, Sita, Ram. Sita, meaning the (inaudible) you know, and as I said she was never born of Man in the manner we mean of being born, the book The Ramayan has many things that were not written about it. There was a king, his name was Janaka and he lived with his wife, just like Abraham and his wife, she had a child you know in old age before they got Isaac as a son, that also had a great symbology of an origin of a certain truth pertaining to the Soul and Janaka found one day his land was all decimated, dried up, the cows are dying and everything is dying and he was a fully realized man too, King Janaka, because he was the guru of the son of Vyas muni, the author of your Bhagavad Gita, and the son&rsquo;s name was Shakuntala, but that was after. This King Janak saw all these things happening to his country and couldn&rsquo;t figure it out, he called in his wise men and they all told him &ldquo;Well the only way you can stop this&hellip; a rival king has done this to you since you have exacted so much tribute from your people, one of these lord chieftains has decided to pay you back in kind and to pay you back in kind, he went out to collect taxes from everyone in his region and he taxed the people from the forest, the Rishis. So Janaka asked &ldquo;How did this chieftain tax these Rishis? All the hermits they don&rsquo;t earn money so they have no money to give&rdquo; but this chieftain had to have something to give to his overlord because he has to pay his taxes. So there were seven of them and each one decided, well the only possession that was of value that they could surrender to such an overlord was a drop of blood. This is a valuable possession, one drop of blood is a valuable thing, especially in a realized body because that body has certain powers in it. (Inaudible) extracted one drop of blood, put it in a little vial, seven drops to this chieftain and then this chieftain realized what he had done because his wise men also told him &ldquo;You better get rid of that vial because you&rsquo;ll curse the bowels of your life.&rdquo; So he took the vial and buried it in Janak&rsquo;s region and from then on everything began to die out because he took life from the living Masters as tribute to live and this force work and will come back on you. If you&rsquo;re that greedy to take blood out of stone, and these men were like stone then, what you call spiritual stone, this force would work back on him. So the force, everything started to die, to keep these people alive, in other words their blood was the only thing that kept them alive and if they had to give it up as taxes, then something had to give up itself for them to exist as spiritual people. As they say if you cut the tongues off from men of peace, the stones themselves would start shouting peace, this is a law that&rsquo;s going on. So everything started to die in relation to what they were giving up because you give up one drop of blood, you&rsquo;re dying that much in life relationships, this is a very deep law. So when these things occurred in his region, his advisors told him that they only way he can stop this is that he had his wife had to plow the field&hellip; (Gap in tape). And the army was being routed and the axle of the chariot in which the king was escaping with broke at the edge of the wheel and this nurse, in order to help her king to escape from being slaughtered by the enemy, pushed her hand through the wheel and held the axle and used her wrist for the wheel to rotate on and the horses kept driving on for miles and to reward her for saving his life, he says &ldquo;Name any boon and it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; She says &ldquo;Well my Lord I only want three things from you: the first and the second I&rsquo;ll take now, the last I&rsquo;ll take when the time comes.&rdquo; So &ldquo;Ok, what is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;The first I&rsquo;d like to have a son from you&rdquo; or &ldquo;a child from you.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright&rdquo; says the king. &ldquo;Second I&rsquo;d like to have a palace, a place where I can live.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; This, as a king, he could have done, he did that. The third he couldn&rsquo;t figure what she would ask for in the third place, but she never did ask for it, she just asked for the first two. She got her wish with a boy and his name was Bharat, that&rsquo;s how India&rsquo;s name became Bharata afterward, we call India today Bharat. You see Iodia used to be the original name of India, the land of Iodia, now it&rsquo;s called Bharat by the Indians. That is like Ishmael and Abraham and Isaac, the Arabs got all the oil and Jews are still like a (inaudible) in Palestine and this is the peculiar law of life goes on. 1:00 She claimed her boon and when the child was born it was called Bharat, he was a half brother to Ram and (inaudible), children of the king. When the king was hunting one day, that&rsquo;s these two boys&rsquo; father, he loved to hunt, just the sheer sake of hunting, Man is the only creature that kills for the sport, he doesn&rsquo;t kill to eat, so he was out hunting and he shot an arrow in the air and the arrow hit someone by mistake who was filling water and it happened to be a young boy and he was so grieved to know that he hit a human being, he thought it was a deer or something, but it was a young boy he hit, and he picked up the boy and the boy was dying already and he asked him where was his folks, he&rsquo;s trying to make some recompense with him and he brought him to the folks who were two blind people and he tried to break the news to them that their son was dead. Well the grief was so great the mother immediately died from the shock and the father, he said to the king, &ldquo;You have taken our eyes and our hands and our feet and our mouth and our bodies away from us, what have we got left, may you die the same way when you pass out, you have nothing, you blind like us&rdquo; and he fell over and died and the king was shocked and all his life, he never paid any attention, to the point where he was in his 50s or 60s, he was about to appoint a price regent to govern the land and give over the reigns of government and he was going blind, just then, a chariot drove up and his wife, this army nurse, stepped down with her whole group of courtiers, came up to see (inaudible). Then she said to him, &ldquo;I come to claim my third boon.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not completely blind, &ldquo;I want my son to be nominated as prince regent.&rdquo; He became instantly blind, totally shocked. He said &ldquo;You, of all people, at this moment when my own (inaudible).&rdquo; He got blind and then she said &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I would tell the whole world you&rsquo;re no man of your word.&rdquo; Now he was a king, he had to fulfill his word, he gave his word, she saved his life. He said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done on one condition, that your own legitimate children will be banished for life from this place, they cannot live here no more&rdquo; and called in the two sons and told them these were the demands from the stepmother. Now when the stepbrother heard the news, he got the news that his mother had done this, he who didn&rsquo;t want no throne, he wanted to go with his other two brothers, they were like fire, you know, three like fire, and the mother was a like water, they all wanted to beat the mother up, but anyway, Rama stepped in and said, &ldquo;No, we must obey the wishes of our father, he&rsquo;s made his vows and this is it, we will go into exile and he and his wife, Sita, and the younger brother (inaudible) and Bharat became the prince regent and the king died not seeing anybody, lost everything. Well coming back to how this law plays back on one, as I said Rama won his wife by certain forces and the same force played itself back by karma. While they were living in the woods because they went to live in the woods, the forest among the forest people, he built a house, he did certain mantrams around the house and told his wife not to leave the house, he had a premonition that Ravana would try to do something. Well Ravana could not come to actually kidnap her under this protective force, he had to use some kind of trickery. So he caused his whole body to appear as a beautiful deer with studded horns of diamonds with a gold tip and caused the hide to be like a psychedelic colors to entice Sita. When she saw that deer run across the woods, she said &ldquo;Oh I have to have that.&rdquo; You know beauty attracts and the husband says &ldquo;That is no deer, that&rsquo;s an illusion.&rdquo; She says &ldquo;No no that&rsquo;s a deer.&rdquo; Well the husband had realize that this was some trick of Ravana but he couldn&rsquo;t convince her. Anyway he went after the deer with his younger brother, while they&rsquo;re searching for the deer Ravana imitated the younger brother&rsquo;s voice as if he was wounded and Rama, knowing that his younger brother being wounded would be his responsibility, how could he come back to his father and tell him that he had neglected to protect his the younger brother. He didn&rsquo;t see his father die, he didn&rsquo;t know his father had died when they were banished. Anyway, he ran into the woods looking for his younger brother, just then Ravana appeared right in front of the house as a begging hermit with a beautiful gold bowl and he said &ldquo;to the lady of the house, give a poor beggar something to eat.&rdquo; Well the mantrams that were drawn around the house, the protective force went up to here, and Rama had told the wife &ldquo;never step beyond these mantrams, no force outside can&hellip;&rdquo; and he was standing right here and he couldn&rsquo;t step across to the house, he held it in front of him. She&rsquo;s seeing him as a poor beggar and as soon as her foot stepped over the mantram, he revealed himself to her right away, he stood up erect, he&rsquo;s Prince Ravana, snatched her, got ahold of his horse and took off. Well he lived in a city called Lanka which is known as Ceylon today and he was known as Prince Ravana of Ceylon or Lanka, the city of the seven palaces, they were all built with the seven cones, and between India to Ceylon there is a sort of a causeway built by rocks, it&rsquo;s long been washed away now, but it was a causeway connecting the two. When Rama returned home and realized what had happened, saw the mantrams were broken. So he had to go and seek aid now to go and get his wife back, the ideal wife, but then he realized he&rsquo;s being paid back in kind now, he couldn&rsquo;t resort to no psychic force, he had to earn his way back, he to go by the natural methods now. So he sought the help of Hanuman, the Prince of the Monkeys. See Man don&rsquo;t seek help from his fellow Man because he lose faith in his fellow Man, he seeks help in the animals, that&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;Hanuman the Monkey God.&rdquo; They draw Hanuman with a face like a monkey, actually the ideas was that Man would eventually turn to the animal to help him after he has lost faith in human beings. You see like our friend Walt Whitman would say, &ldquo;I can look at animals for hours and hours and enjoy their being for they do not hate their kind, they do not condemn their kind, they do not pray to no unseen god for some good crumbs to fall on them, they are not hypocrites to themselves.&rdquo; So he was glad to look at animals. Well this is true, Rama went to seek the help of the monkeys and Hanuman was the representation of the monkeys. 1:10 Well the monkey is the closest thing Man has as being intelligent, the ape you know, because it&rsquo;s like Tarzan and the apes, see where Mr. Rice Burroughs got his idea. So Hanuman found out where the barricade where Sita was kept by the Prince Ravana in the palace and in order to help Rama, he decided to attract the attention. Well they&rsquo;ve seen a monkey, they know a monkey is mischief and the moment you catch hold of a monkey you gotta get rid of him. So he told the people if they would tie a rag around his tail and tin cans and light it, that would get rid of him. So the people got the monkey and tied the rag around his tail with tin cans, cans you know in those days were brass things that would make noise jangling, but the monkey was smart, as soon as they did that, he jumped on the rooftop of the house and the house was made out of trash and it all went up in flames to cause a distraction so Ramana and his friends could come in and get out Sita. Well not counting on the fact that this would lead to a war now, it was outright declare war between Rama and Ravana, Ravana representing the evil force and Rama representing the good force, that&rsquo;s how eventually it broke down. What it was meaning that idealism had to face guile in some form in order to prove itself by natural methods. If you have an ideal to live for, you&rsquo;ll always be confronted by some form of guile to trick you to make your ideal appear as ridiculous until you can demonstrate the genuineness of your nature, that your ideal is real and then you defeat it off all the time, this is what you&rsquo;re really trying to prove to yourself, that you can defeat guile by being natural, by being very real and idealistic in this natural state and not in an unnatural state, not in a distorted state, that you can really overcome this guile concept. Well Ravana had several brothers and they were all in charge of the war council and when they started to debate how they were going to fight Rama and his brothers and his people, one brother, his name was Bishnu, he got up and said &ldquo;No I cannot join you, although you be my elder brother, in this battle against Prince Rama.&rdquo; Yet the Lord Bima was a great master of creating a smokescreen with his mind, this is how he&rsquo;d fight, he&rsquo;d go out to fight and as soon as opponent approaches him, he would call a smokescreen with him mind and the opponent would never see who he&rsquo;s fighting before he destroyed the opponent and before he went out to fight he told his brother he would never do this, he says &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a wrong already.&rdquo; And the brother says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still head of this house and you obey me.&rdquo; Well normally in those countries, in those times, the elder one was always the one who carried the law. He says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this against my better judgement and may God be my judge.&rdquo; Well he fought many of Rama&rsquo;s friends and defeated them and every time he came to fight Rama, he would avoid the issue. Well one night he crept over to the camp, Rama&rsquo;s camp, and told Rama, he revealed himself who he was and he told Rama &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to beat my brother, you cannot win him, he has every trick in the book to deceive you, there&rsquo;s only one way is to know his secret.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;You both pray to the Divine Principle at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning and the Divine Principle is non-biased, the one with the greater devotion is the one who gets the greater influx from this Principle. So you being a man of idealism and my brother being a man of pure guile, each one has a desire, one to out-trick and one to uphold so which one of you will have the greatest devotion tomorrow morning will outdo the other, but in the meantime if you fail in your devotion, I will be at a certain gate to let you in to where my brother is praying and while he&rsquo;s in the midst of his prayer, it could be only the goddess descending that will cause him to leave that spot of his meditation to get up and talk.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the time to challenge him to a fight.&rdquo; This is the proof of the devotion. While Ravana was preparing his meditation, he&rsquo;s sitting down and he&rsquo;s trying to meditate to focus his mind&hellip; I jumped the story a little, before this happened Ravana had shot an arrow and it hit the kneecap of Lakshman, the younger brother of Rama, and he started to die. Well this arrow was built-in with certain psychic forces in it and Rama tried to get his psychic forces, spiritual forces to stop it, but he only could stop it to a certain extent and then it would start to expand. Then he called in a priest / doctor and asked him what we can do to save his brother&rsquo;s life, he told he he says &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one herb, it&rsquo;s called the leaf of life, that grows on the tree of life, you can stick this leaf anywhere and it will grow, all you got to do is throw a little water on it.&rdquo; I used to keep one, it looks like a fat iceberg leaf, you ever seen an iceberg leaf? The plant they call an iceberg, it&rsquo;s fat and juicy and you take just the leaf and stick it in water and it keeps growing by itself, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;leaf of life,&rdquo; you find it in the tropical countries, in this country they have it too. Well they say &ldquo;on this tree of leaf of life there is a light shining on it and that&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s is a genuine one and it&rsquo;s on the mountain called Parbat and that&rsquo;s way up in the Himalayas. So Hanuman volunteered to go for this leaf of life and while he was going, he forget to ask the priest what the leaf of life really looked like except that there was a light on top of the tree, how would he recognize the real one, only by this light. In the meantime Ravana was meditating and he saw what was happening and by his power of concentration, he caused all the trees on that mountain of Parbat to have a light. So when Hanuman arrived, he was confused, he didn&rsquo;t know which was the tree of life now to pick this leaf so then his devotion to God came out now, he says &ldquo;my devotion must be so strong that I&rsquo;ll move this mountain, if I have faith in God, I&rsquo;ll move this mountain.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where Jesus got&hellip; actually referring to that act. You see Jesus was a great Master who came after, many of the things that He spoke of had happened in different cultures, He knew this had happened one time. Hanuman prayed so deeply and meditated so powerfully in meditation that the mountain started to vibrate and in the vibration the mountain lifted itself by telekinetic forces. It&rsquo;s not a very big mountain when you find out where it is actually located and it moved by this telekinetic power of Hanuman and it&rsquo;s traveling through the air right across Iodia where Prince Bharat the prince regent ruling. Well Prince Bharat hearing this rumbling noise in the atmosphere thought he was being invaded, he thought it was a flying saucer, it looked like a flying saucer moving through the atmosphere and according to the Ramayan it was said that Hanuman went from Ceylon to the mountain Parbat in a Rahat Ramana. Now anyone who read Adamski&rsquo;s works, The Flying Saucers Have Landed, the saucer is always being referred to as a Ramana, this is the word that the saucer people calls it and it&rsquo;s strange you&rsquo;ll find it in Sanskrit, it&rsquo;s being referred to as Dirhat Ramana. 1:20 It was a flying vehicle powered by magnetic forces powered by the mind, see flying saucers was not new even to these people, our civilization is so old you know. Now he flew in this thing from one spot to another and when he arrived he was bringing this thing by telekinetic power, power of the mind. When he was passing over Iodia Prince Bharat heard this noise and thought it was a flying saucer or something and they say Prince Bharat ordered a Sat Bhand to be fired into the air to bring down the object. Now Sat is sound and Bhand is unguided missile, it&rsquo;s a missile, it&rsquo;s like an arrow. In other words if it were literally translated, an arrow fired and controlled by sound. Now we know this did not happen and there was not way you can control an arrow by sound unless you are dealing with electronics or something, so this would have to be a missile or what you call a sidewinder, that sought its objective through the sound frequencies and hit it, this is actually what he did fire now. They fired actually a missile and hit the flying object of Hanuman and brought it down. When it landed, he saw this man in this object and he told him that he was Hanuman, friend of the Prince Rama whose brother Lakshman was dying and he was going to the mountain Parbat to get the Leaf of Life. Well Bharat knew the Leaf of Life and he reached out from the mountain Parbat and he pointed to him and he says &ldquo;Now keep your eye on that one. Now I&rsquo;m going to put you in a Sighan Dan and transport you to my brother&rsquo;s location.&rdquo; Well a Sighan Dan is again an object that can move through space by the control of the human voice. So this man got in this object, held up by these magnetic forces and by the voice of Bharat intoning certain words, he directed like remote control, he guided him into a landing point in Ceylon strictly and directly to the point. He landed with this object and everything and he handed it to the Biku and the Biku broke off a piece of the Leaf of Life and rubbed it to save the life of Lakshman. They won the battle, they killed Ravana, they were able to locate Ravana when he was praying and they fought each other because Ravana realized he was losing, he had to get up and fight, they broke his devotion and he got killed, but the question came up, what did Hanuman do with the mountain Parbat? If he really did move the mountain Parbat, if he did fly through the air across Iodia, and he was shot down, these were questions that the logical mind would indicate. He placed it on another mountain, he put one mountain on top of another mountain and he called it Everest. Now every man who has climbed Mount Everest will tell you it is not a single mountain, it&rsquo;s a double mountain. It comes up in a peak and gets a base, wide out, and there&rsquo;s a little hillock and then it starts going back out. They called it &ldquo;the extra peak of Everest&rdquo; and that name has never changed since that time, no one knows why they called it Everest, it&rsquo;s called Mount Everest to this day. No man came along calling it that name, there is no Englishman ever came and called it Everest, but this was a name that was left on that mountain, Mount Everest, and this is exactly how Hanuman left it, he lodged it there. Now when Jesus came along, He said &ldquo;if you have faith in Me, you will say unto the mountain &lsquo;Move&rsquo; and it will move.&rdquo; If you have this faith like a grain of mustard seed, a mustard seed is a pretty small thing. So He knew pretty well devotion was such a great thing that can bring this force into play. Now the same thing was true that Rama knew devotion would have beaten Ravana so when Bhimu opened the gate and let them go into the altar room where his brother was praying, his brother was deep in devotion and he saw what was happening, he realized that he was coming to the end of his rope because the spiritual vision was fading now and he was challenged to get up and fight. Well it was either that he would stay there and not move from there and just keep on praying or to get up and fight. Now this is the challenge the ego faces, which is greater: to be considered a coward to sit down and keep on praying or to exert your ego to get up and fight to prove a point, which is the greater cowardice? Well the greater cowardice was to get up and fight because he was not a coward if he kept on praying because Rama couldn&rsquo;t kill him then, it would be against all principles of human justice to kill a praying man and he was unarmed too. It was like in the old cowboy days you know, &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s have a shoot-down now.&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t shoot an unarmed man, it was against the code of the West, but ego got the better part of Ravana and he got up from his devotion and this is what (inaudible) says, &ldquo;You pray to the Divine Power, it&rsquo;s unbiased, but the only time it has the greatest chance to flow into a human being is by the power of that person&rsquo;s devotion.&rdquo; Now Rama was so devoted to regain his wife, to his ideal, that he kept this pressure on, and Ravana his ego got the better part of him, instead of kept on praying, he got up to protect himself and defend that principle, so he got killed. And after Sita was taken back you know, then there&rsquo;s where Rama, the husband again had the problem of man and wife, he wanted her to prove her faithfulness to him, if she was unfaithful to him while she was kidnapped, and through the trials of ordeal, she went through fire twice and the third time she went back into the furrow, where she came from. As I said she was not born by man or woman, she was the result of seven drops of blood from the great Rishis, she dissolved her body form back. In other words the Rishis knew all this was going to happen when they gave up their seven drops of blood. In other words they got back their seven drops of blood. And the champ that remained years after Rama lived because he had two sons that he didn&rsquo;t recognize when they were brought to him and these were his own sons, one was called Kus and the other was called Alkus. When Sita was in captivity, she was pregnant you see and she gave birth to these two sons during the battle and to avoid them being killed by Ravana, she hid them in the forest while the armies were fighting and after she was rescued, in the compound of Ravana&rsquo;s country, she never mentioned that these two sons were born to Rama, that these were actually his two sons. Well, a she wolf became the foster mother of these two kids and they grew up among the wolves and one day a great Rishi was passing and he saw this she wolf with these two kids and he adopted these two kids as his own children and wolf became a household pet and he taught those two sons the entire story of the life of Rama and Sita by word of mouth. 1:30 Now this was the own Guru of Rama, see his Guru didn&rsquo;t die, his Guru taught him how to use the bow and arrow and allow him to lose his wife, and his Guru went to the point of taking back his two sons to teach him the whole story of their life. So one day when Rama was an old man now, along came these two young boys chanting the life of Sita and Ram and he was amazed &ldquo;where did they know the details of their lives in such minute details&rdquo; and this is how the Ramayan, the Song of Rama, was written. He questioned these two kids and he realized and just then he had a heart attack, that these were his own sons from his own wife Sita, it was too late then, and he passed on. But how karma works, he lived as an ideal husband, he lived to show how to obey the laws of life and yet how these things would work back, all through the grace of the Guru. When he did leave the body, who did he meet? He met the Guru standing there, he had to live this particular cycle out, but then after he lived the cycle out, you see Sita came back too because the life principle is never lost. Now the father of Sita is interesting, he was King Janak and one day he was in his courtyard and there was a great Sage by the name of Vyas Muni, Muni mean monk, the monk Vyas, or Vyasa, some people pronounce it Vyasa, and he wrote the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Arjuna. Now he had a son and when his wife was pregnant, when she was asleep, he waited until she was asleep, that was the origin of sleep education you know, he would talk to the wife under the somnambulistic state and educate the son in the womb, he taught the son the entire Bhagavad Gita by word of mouth while she was in that somnambulistic state. And when the child was born, at the age of four, the child was able to repeat word for word, without even prompting, the entire Bhagavad Gita back to the father and he realized his father was a great man. So when he got to about 30 or 40 years of age, he said to his father, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you initiate me, you must be my Guru.&rdquo; The father says &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not your Guru.&rdquo; Even though the father was a great Master, he could not assume the responsibility of that Soul, each Soul has a link to a particular Master. So he says &ldquo;No, your Master is a King named Janak, you go visit him.&rdquo; Well here&rsquo;s this boy with all his books and he&rsquo;s all raring to go, comes from a very good family, and he comes up to King Janak&rsquo;s castle and out in the courtyard he sees King Janak, somebody&rsquo;s fanning him, and he has a big flaggard of wine, smoking, enjoying the sunshine, and around his is dancing some beautiful damsel, entertaining the king. So the kid looks and says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my Guru? This guy is going to be my Guru, my father must be nuts. What can he teach me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adano65_2RecordedfromVisitQ2RRNW6 - &ldquo;The way he lives is no example of a Guru.&rdquo; So he shakes his head, he didn&rsquo;t say nothing, he goes back to his father he says &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a disgrace, a shame to think you of all people, to send me to such a person, that is my Guru? How can you do a thing like this to me?&rdquo; Father says, &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s your Guru, you go right back.&rdquo; Well he struggled and he struggled in his mind, ok just to please the father he went back and he&rsquo;s standing in front again and he sees the same thing, in fact this time it&rsquo;s getting more louder and everything and everybody is kissing the king and he&rsquo;s having a ball. He can&rsquo;t figure this out, just then he&rsquo;s about to turn his mind away from all these things and decide once and for all he&rsquo;s gonna be a hermit and to heck with his daddy&rsquo;s idea and to heck with this guy, then the king turn around and says &ldquo;Hey young man, just a minute. Oh I see you&rsquo;re Shakuntala, the son of the brave Vyas Muni.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t even introduce himself and the king just told him straight off who he was right there, that shook him up right then. &ldquo;Come sit down now, what you got on your mind?&rdquo; So the kid says &ldquo;Well my father sent me to you to be my Guru, I want to study.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s talk about God.&rdquo; So they start talking about God, all of a sudden a big fire flared up in the compound and somebody run in and says &ldquo;Your majesty, the palace compound is on fire.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb me, you go and do what you can, don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m talking about God with my friend here.&rdquo; An hour passed and the fire is getting bigger and bigger now, the same man came back and says &ldquo;Your majesty is getting close to the palace door.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;You do what you can, save what you can, don&rsquo;t interrupt, I&rsquo;m talking God with my friend here.&rdquo; Another hour passed and the flames are coming in the door right now, into the building in the room where they are and Shakuntala is (Adano making blowing noises), he sees the flames and here is his little pile of books, he cares so much you know, (Adano making stomping sounds) put out the fire and the king is looking at him. The king burst out laughing, he says &ldquo;Young man who&rsquo;s more matter soaked, who is more matter conscious, you have a pile of books you&rsquo;re trying to save, a pile of writing? My palace is all burned up, I don&rsquo;t even give a hoot. You claim that you&rsquo;re more God-man and here you are stuck with your little pile of books.&rdquo; Anyway he did like, clapped his hands, the fire stopped, clapped his hands, the section that was burned came back, clapped his hands a third time everything was exactly where they were and this kind of shook up the kid you know. He realized this was really a Master now, he wasn&rsquo;t just an ordinary guy. Well the Master in fact would not have done this if he didn&rsquo;t want the man as a disciple, he knew that this man was a disciple you see. His father knew already you see but the kid had to pass through this particular shocking experience, the father knew how far this other man had evolved already so he knew where his son had to go. So he says &ldquo;You know you ask a hard thing, discipleship / initiation, you have to merit this thing. The first thing you gotta prove you can obey, well here are two lamps full of oil, now hold them in both hands, they&rsquo;re full of oil, and walk through this entire palace and see everything inside and try to memorize it, describe it to me when you come back.&rdquo; Well he walked through and in two hours he was back, so the king says &ldquo;you mean you memorized everything in my palace so fast, you got a wonderful brain.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;No your majesty, I was too busy watching to not spill a drop of oil on your beautiful carpets. I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to see anything.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Well you failed my test, go back home.&rdquo; Well this is a disgrace to fail a test and go home to your father, oh boy this could never happen&hellip; daddy said this was the Guru and now you fail? The Guru don&rsquo;t want you? He says &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll give you another chance.&rdquo; This trip now 10 hours passed, 17 hours passed, he didn&rsquo;t see the boy. So the king went looking for him and he found him in the garden, sitting with the two lights like that. Then the king says &ldquo;Well you pass the door of perception, can you tell me what is my tenth floor story.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh king, better than the gold on the table is the love that molded it, better than the love that molded the gold on the table was the thought who gave birth to it, better than the thought that gave birth to it was the fact that reality isn&rsquo;t (inaudible) at all.&rdquo; The king says &ldquo;You are my disciple, you are free, you&rsquo;re a free man&rdquo; and he went back home to his father. He had realized what he came for. See once we realize that this power is in us, then we are forced to go back in the world and live in the world. See the great Sages do not want us to avoid the world, the world is necessary for certain karmic life. When we use the word karma, don&rsquo;t think of it being bad, it&rsquo;s not bad. Karma is only a Sanskrit word meaning action and interaction, cause and effect, we live in the world of cause and effect, action and reaction, we cannot avoid it, we can learn to cope with it. So we say accidents are not happening to us, they are caused by us. Even the insurance company today would say &ldquo;the accident didn&rsquo;t happen to you, you caused it somewhere.&rdquo; They know that we live in this world of causation and because of that we realize that we are causing certain forces to come into play in our lives daily for good as well as for not so good. Now there is no such thing as bad in the universe, there are levels of goodness all the time. What is good at one level is considered bad at another level and what is bad at one level is considered good at another level. It all depends on the relationship and the involvement and the sensitivity of the understanding. For instance, Shakuntala was reared in a home that ate no meat, there was no such vile dancing and here he came all of a sudden into the kings palace and all these things were going on, you see, and he couldn&rsquo;t cope with it, but then he began to realize that all these were only parts of existence, they&rsquo;re not really what we are, then he became free. The thing is when you go inside, you&rsquo;re trying to realize the consciousness of your existence and how to bring this consciousness of your existence into the waking state and you only can achieve that by meditation, you see. Drugs do simulate it or make you experience a sort of a false condition of it, it doesn&rsquo;t produce a lasting condition, it produces a temporary condition, you have something to compare but it is temporary, not permanent, and you don&rsquo;t have the control of your will, you see, because if you have a toothache and you put a drug, you will numb the spot, the pain would be temporarily suspended. Now if you could employ the Will and permanently suspend it, then you suspend it and some people do that occasionally through hypnosis or what you call suggestion. There is no real thing called hypnosis in the real sense of the word, these are all functions of the laws of life and suggestion is a powerful law, it can control, and that&rsquo;s why today we realize why we have psychosomatic diseases, diseases of mind / body relationship. We actually cause these diseases by the mind, not the body, and this is true suggestion. For instance, you&rsquo;re a young person and you hear the parent say, &ldquo;Oh go away, don&rsquo;t bother us, you&rsquo;re so clumsy, you can&rsquo;t do nothing right.&rdquo; And they keep saying it and before you know it you begin to respond to a clumsy action, a clumsy behavior, you never seem to be doing anything right, you follow me. 0:10 So what is happening, you&rsquo;re hypnotizing yourself, this is the term you would call it, but what you are really doing is that you&rsquo;re responding to sound waves setup by the environment which consider your actions as being clumsy. They have no measurement of what clumsiness really is and you have no measurement of what clumsiness is to you. You may be doing it accurately as far as you are concerned, as far as they are concerned you are doing it inaccurately only because in their relationship from their experience, they have that much control. In your relationship from your experience you got this much control, so control is the thing they are arguing over and clumsiness is only in relation to how much control you have over a thing, the more you do the thing the better control you have and the less clumsy you are and the least you do the thing, the more clumsy you appear to be so clumsiness don&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s lack of involvement, not being exposed to the thing enough, this is why we say a person&rsquo;s clumsy. Not true, everyone has an ability but we may not have enough opportunities to apply the ability and this would be the opportunity. I guess you have lots of questions to ask, let&rsquo;s have some meditation. (Gap in tape). To the first question, yes, second question, we are all brothers and sisters of light because the human body is a manifestation of light, it&rsquo;s energy. As I said before, the universe was made for Man and not Man for the universe, God the Creative Intelligence could not create Man first and a universe second, how would He provide for the creature? Now you&rsquo;re not going to catch the bird before you have the cage to put it in, if you&rsquo;re a human being you don&rsquo;t do that, you see, Creative Intelligence would not do the same thing. You would always have the cage first and the birdseed then you go get a bird for it, right? So the cage was made for the bird, not the bird for the cage, that&rsquo;s the same thing, the world is made for us, not us for the world, that&rsquo;s why we are free, our destiny is the stars, transmigration of the stars all the time. We migrate and migrate from planet to planet, our whole universe is one migration principle, we are NO-mads, not YES-mads. When you run into a YES-mad, steer clear of him. A nomadic life in the physical sense, in the spiritual sense, is the truth because we are wanderers of light and when we say wanderers, not an aimless wanderer, light is a wandering force, it moves all the time and if you put a light and you take a disk and cut some slots in it and put a little motor and that disk spins around that light, and especially if you put little segments of various colored paper in it, it will throw a multitude of motion all around the room and you setup music to it, you&rsquo;ll see this experience that Man is light and if he starts to move slightly in that motion, the person who is observing will start to see many different things of the same person. You see this is one way to know that the human being is light and we know that by matter because this is matter and it&rsquo;s composed of 16 chemical elements and today it&rsquo;s $1.90 now, it used to be $1.60 at one time, yet the scientists cannot put it together and make flesh, he knows what it is but he can&rsquo;t make flesh with it. He knows that matter is energy and he knows energy is light and heat and the first thing that was ever created in this universe out of antimatter was light. See for everything we have, we have an opposite, this universe is polarity, male and female, light and darkness, everything is in a state of polarity. So there are only two actual things that do exist: one, pure energy as light, two, consciousness as anti-light or the thing that holds light together, you cannot see it but you can feel consciousness, you can feel the presence of Masters, but you don&rsquo;t see Them until you raise the speed of light up and you have to raise up the light in your mechanism to see Them at the level They&rsquo;re in because they exist in an antimatter state or an invisible state if you want to call it, it&rsquo;s invisible to the extent of the normal range, but an animal can see Them. An animal knows when a Master comes in the room or any being comes in the room, he can sense, because their vision (inaudible), but the pupil is refracting light differently. See the rods and the cones in the retina are doing the action like a camera and it picks up the light different. Now the fully realized Master emits light from His body all the time and you can feel it, like a current going through you, you feel like a sort of electrical force moving. Now if the Masters are always there all the time, you can link into them because it&rsquo;s all electricity. See God is light and sound, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and the Word dwelt with Man.&rdquo; Now this is a genuine truth, it&rsquo;s an actual fact, at the very instant of creative manifestation, sound vibration was present, so to say &ldquo;in the beginning was the Word&rdquo; at the very instant &ldquo;Ahhhhhh&rdquo; breath and sound were there. Now I want something, let&rsquo;s say I want bread, I inhale and I feel the texture in my mouth like if I know what that piece of bread should taste like, then I go out and the action results but you see how the relationships are linked up? They&rsquo;re all sound principles, all consciousness inside so that&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;In&hellip;&rdquo; (gap in tape) &hellip; pure light which is heaven you see? There is no such place called a heaven or no such place called a hell, there are two planes of motion because God is all motion and He is the motionless motion because without this motionlessness in it, it would be out of harmony, it would fly apart. There is no such force flying apart by itself, they all contain some law of balance, some geometrical action, it obeys laws, laws so delicately balanced that everything is accurate. Strange that such a great, intelligence condition exists, but it is there, it&rsquo;s fast and slow. Now the slower this consciousness becomes and the slower light becomes, the denser and the solid-er it appears and the human body is the slowest form it&rsquo;s appearing in. 0:20 So we say Intelligence or God chose to condition Himself or Herself or Itself into a body, therefore they say the body is the temple of the Living God. Now we know why they use the term, we would not have known before. Why they call it the Temple, what is a Temple? It&rsquo;s a location and why is it living? Because it&rsquo;s vibrating, because it&rsquo;s not a dead object and God is not a form, it&rsquo;s a Principle, so you say the body is the Temple of the Living God. Now, and then the Masters of life engineering would say, &ldquo;Know ye not that ye are gods?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you know that this manifestation is God in Its purest sense at a slow speed, can you not realize it? &ldquo;Know ye not,&rdquo; can you not realize or recognize that at this slow speed, which is a body, which is a manifestation of the pure Intelligence, is God already? And don&rsquo;t you realize that it was made flesh? This same principle slowed down into a form of flesh and &ldquo;dwelt in Man,&rdquo; the only way you can comprehend or communicate is sound, you see. Now everything gives up sound (Adano claps his hands), half a sound, if you clap you have two, everything has got sound (Adano snaps his fingers), there&rsquo;s nothing in this universe that doesn&rsquo;t give up sound so it&rsquo;s there all the time. Now that&rsquo;s why they said &ldquo;the Word. In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; in the beginning was this cosmic force, cosmic vibration. Now your name is Randy, right? But that&rsquo;s a word, that&rsquo;s a sound, to identify this condition body, so the name of God is Sound, He has no other name, He is the cosmic sound so why don&rsquo;t we say &ldquo;(inaudible) happy to meet you in my voice, happy am I to talk to you back, I recognize you, you are me!&rdquo; Where else can you be but in this voice that&rsquo;s talking, it&rsquo;s a miracle, this inhalation, this exhalation, this is the greatest miracle, this is the God Principle. &ldquo;Know ye not&rdquo; can I not understand, why am I so dense, what&rsquo;s separating me? This is it, I recognize that sound, life, this is the force, light, this is the thing. Now we are brother and sisters of light and in a true sense, pure light, we share life within, you see, the genes of our bodies are compositions of light at different speeds and the pigmentation is only a different way it refracts the light. Anybody study art or painting? You&rsquo;d know that one color is only true in relation to the next color next to it, otherwise a color has no color. If you were to separate a color from its next color, top bottom or sideways, it would be no color at all, it can only exist as a color because it has something next to it. This is only red in relation to because this is green or this is pale&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s fantastic dimension in which it is existing, you cannot recognize it because if you were to switch off the light, it has no color no more. Light gives it color, that is relationship is only in relation to the next one. So the chemical relationship that is causing the light to break up allows you to perceive this as a color, really there is no color, yet there is all colors because only of light. Now you see light shining and you say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see no color in that light&rdquo; and somebody says &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll show that whole thing is all colors. It&rsquo;s not white, there&rsquo;s no such thing as white.&rdquo; Then you go get a crystal and you hold it at a certain angle and you break the light. What you have done, you caused a diffusion to occur and then you start to see the colors of the rainbow and you start to realize there are colors. Where did it come from, how did it get in there? And yet it&rsquo;s all white light. Now true in ourselves, we are light. Now we have this light in the form of the human body. Now Jesus said, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single,&rdquo; that means single vision now, centralized, &ldquo;the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; Now if this be the temple of God and if God be sound and light, then if my eyes are required to be focused, to be single or centralized, which means at one point, and my whole body would be light, this is proof enough that we are all brothers and sisters of light, right, what other proof do we need? We can take it and break it down atomically and look at it under a microscope to satisfy ourselves by scratching a match, we&rsquo;ll all end up with light, ignite the cells and they&rsquo;re all going to go up in light. So the proof that everyone or everything in nature at its slowest speed in this form of matter is really light and if that speed is increased we will be exhibiting pure light. If you take this object and increase its speed to a point where it became invisible, it would have to approach the speed of light to be invisible to the naked eye and the speed of light is considered 186,000 miles a second. This thing would have to rotate at that velocity in order for you not to recognize it and therefore it goes away from your vision temporarily and therefore this is only an extension of light. Now if you raise this to the speed to the speed of light squared, it would ignite itself into light, it would be just (Adano makes a psst sound) and it&rsquo;s all light, it&rsquo;s only burned back into pure energy. So there is nothing here actually in this universe which is not energy, which is not light, this whole universe is light. In other words, God is Light. Audience: But then the relationship between sound and light? Adano: Which comes first, the sound or the light? You&rsquo;ve heard thunder, you&rsquo;ve seen lightening, two physical manifestations of the reality of God, which comes first, the sound or the light? Audience: They come at the same time, only we hear it&hellip; Audience: Isn&rsquo;t the light and the sound the same thing? Adano: Ahhh haaa! They are the same in existence at the instant of contact, but they are not the same in relative relationship from an observation, you see, sight will pick up the light faster than the hearing will pick up the sound, yet if the hearing is increased or the hearing becomes acute or intuitive, then the hearing transcends the sight. &ldquo;No Man saw God but saw His light,&rdquo; but Man can hear God all the time, big difference huh? See you can always hear God all the time, but you may not always see Him all the time. So it says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; in the beginning is Cosmic Sound, His name, the Divine Current, the Divine Life Stream, out of that Divine Life Stream this current is going, this sound is present all the time. Hearing it is a whole lot easier to accomplish than seeing it, seeing it can be delusive, but hearing cannot be delusive because hearing is the final thing. &ldquo;Those who heard My name or My voice know Me for who I am. Those who have seen Me and think that is what I am, may not know it is themselves.&rdquo; Now if you&rsquo;re hearing the Divine Current, close your eyes, that&rsquo;s what meditation helps you to hear it and then seeing it you see. First you hear, this is the purpose of it. Audience: Not sure of the same time. Adano: It&rsquo;s just like the thunder and the lightening, you see they are working together, but normally in the human being, in the outward world, you see the flash of lightening before you hear the thunder, but in the inward realm, you hear it first before you see it. 0:30 I thought some people saw the light first and then heard it, and then other people heard it and then saw the light. Adano: No, they may not recognize that they&rsquo;re hearing it, but they always hear it first before they see it and you were always hearing it and did not recognize that you were hearing it until it&rsquo;s pointed out to you that you&rsquo;re hearing it. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t it impossible to hear it unless you have been initiated? Adano: No, that would not be because God is always present as sound, you may not recognize Him as this particular sound that you are hearing, you do not know that is really Him, and when you&rsquo;re initiated it becomes obvious to you. In other words it is accentuated in your consciousness, that sound, initiation is only an accentuation of that particular sound that you&rsquo;re blessed to hear and did not recognize. That is the purpose of having a living Guru to make you recognize the thing. In other words, you passed this and did not know it was a rose and you smell it everyday, &ldquo;Boy that is a beautiful flower. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a flower, but it has a name, what do you call it? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; So the gardener or horticulturist says &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rose!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s a rose, what kind of rose, there are so many different varieties?&rdquo; You still need somebody to point out which one is which, you understand, you&rsquo;re hearing many different sounds inside, and may not recognize what they represent or what they really are, but a Guru is initiating you is the only living contact that accentuates in your consciousness, &ldquo;This one is the thing you got to listen to, this particular vibration, link yourself, this one.&rdquo; In other words, this particular strain is the one you&rsquo;re listening to. Audience: Charan Singh wrote that the disciple disconnected from the sound over the many incarnations of acting through the senses and then the Master has to come and link him to it again. Adano: Right, he has to come and point out, accentuated back for him to hear it so he can be linked back to it. Now you see we really don&rsquo;t lose it in the true sense of how he&rsquo;s using the word, he&rsquo;s using it primitively, you lose the recognition of the sound that is passing through. The audible life stream passes through all of us, we cannot stop that, we may not recognize the sound of the audible life stream in us, that is what we call Name of God or The Word, the Cosmic Vibration, we may not recognize, we lose the recognition of it by being involved through the five senses in nature because the five senses have the tendency to shut it out, exclude it from our&hellip;, it&rsquo;s a refined form of energy, a very refined form of sound, so refined that it requires silence to hear it. That&rsquo;s why in monastic orders they involve themselves with silence in order to listen, it&rsquo;s like a musician, see you have to listen so keenly for it that to recognize that it&rsquo;s coming back. Now once we hear it, it may sound strange to us and we may not know what it is, you may think you&rsquo;ve gone nuts, you&rsquo;ve got bees buzzing in your head or you&rsquo;ve got something wrong with you, you&rsquo;ve got a blow on the head or something. Well this thing will bother you for quite awhile till you get aggravated, then you come in contact with a Master who will initiate you, that is to say through His audible life current, He sends the force into you like a battery charger and causes your brain to speed up to recognize the thing. That&rsquo;s what He does when He touches you, He accentuates the charge. You see the charge in your brain is slow because it&rsquo;s been drained off, you&rsquo;ve drained off the brain charge in involving yourself with material objects, He has only reserved His brain charge by going back in and making His body a power energy, a transformer, so that&rsquo;s what He really is. Now when Jesus says if you look inside you see your whole body is light, pure energy, consciousness, but when you get the initiation you hear this sound, it becomes louder than normal and then you start to listen for it and in listening for it, it has its own particular melodies because it&rsquo;s on that you have the whole scale. Our scale is not seven you know, there are more scales up there than you ever dreamed to begin to number mathematically. God is not limited to seven and in the world we live in we think seven, but not true, it&rsquo;s unlimited scales. A Master only accentuates it for us by making us conscious of it, that&rsquo;s why They initiate and that&rsquo;s why They try to get people to meditate. Meditation helps you to prepare yourself more and more to bring it in. Then that answers your second question, we&rsquo;re all brothers and sisters of light, this is matter, pure energy and I saw Ronnie face change (inaudible)&hellip; This third question here, she has answered it herself, &ldquo;I have seen and known on some other plane,&rdquo; she has met you on some other plane of consciousness, but you don&rsquo;t know it. Audience: When they&rsquo;re asleep? Adano: You see I ask a question many times to everybody, &ldquo;do we know who we are when we&rsquo;re sound asleep, if we are male or female?&rdquo; This is the first test you have to pass in the road of realization, if you want to realize yourself, that&rsquo;s the first thing you have to accomplish. Don&rsquo;t try to accomplish to move the mountain or try to walk on top of water, learn to master each step in its real sequence and you&rsquo;ll find that you master all the others. Find out for sure who you are when you&rsquo;re sound asleep, if you are a man or a woman, and you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;ll not sleep unconsciously anymore. Audience: What do you mean by if I&rsquo;m a man or a woman. Adano: Well, do you dream? Audience: Yes. Adano: You dream every night and are you aware of the fact that you are dreaming, that you are playing the role of man or woman in the dream but yet there&rsquo;s a conflict that you know you&rsquo;re a man in this existence, rather you would stick to the one form you know more than the one that would appear to be a in a dream? This is the conflict that goes on, we want to be the thing we think we are, not the thing that is occurring within us. Now the thing that is occurring within us is showing us our true nature, that we are neither man nor woman, we are pure consciousness and that in any given situation, in any human body form, is how you react to those conditions, make you free. See Masters are not only men you know, They&rsquo;re women too, you use the word Master it implies freedom from the repercussions of thinking, a Master of life is any individual who has achieved the ability to be free from the repercussions of their thinking, therefore your sins are forgiven, now you understand how your sins are forgiven. If you&rsquo;re thoughts don&rsquo;t have any repercussions in any form that are detrimental to you, you&rsquo;re a free Soul. If what you say don&rsquo;t hurt you and don&rsquo;t come back and hit you in your face, you&rsquo;re free. Audience: Why is that so much harder to do, the thoughts keep flying in? Adano: The human mind, mind is an ever-flowing force and because the whole body is energy and the energy is in the vibrating rate and what appears to be difficult primarily is our association with the environment in which we live in. 0:40 Our environment tells us that is round because we have been exposed to accept it through the five senses as round, we&rsquo;re exposed to the sensation that it stays stable and doesn&rsquo;t go away from being round, it doesn&rsquo;t get flat. You ever look at mirrors when you go to horror houses, you look one way and the face is stretched one way? Well imagine this is exactly what the universe is, everything is being stretching around in different positions, but the vision has imprisoned itself to hold certain things as they really are. We are photographically recording through the vision conditions to satisfy the brain that would appear as a harmonious environment, lest we end up appearing and living in a schizophrenic existence. The whole universe is one big schizophrenic existence because there is so such wrong thing in the universe, everything is pure energy in a state of motion, you understand, but this appearance of being round, this appearance of being coordinated and solidified is a mental action, it&rsquo;s not really there. That&rsquo;s why the Sages say that this is an illusion, that Man cannot live with reality, it would be impossible for Man to live totally in the reality, he can only dip into it occasionally and draw from it and come back into the illusion. So in true sleep we are given the chance to experience the reality, but we sleep in an unconscious way because we don&rsquo;t recognize ourselves in this, we don&rsquo;t recognize this fluidic existence of ours, we don&rsquo;t know how this fluidic existence of our, we only recognize it as a stable, static existence when we&rsquo;re awake and we have confidence that this is solid and not going to fall on our heads. Yet if we were to see the reality of it all the time and it was flowing and you can push your hand right through it, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do more, you&rsquo;d get scared of it because you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re really standing on something solid, you go sliding right through it, you see. This is the conflict, you feel like &ldquo;brother am I sitting in a whole ocean of water,&rdquo; ocean of life is water, it has a water effect on the mind. That&rsquo;s why even the Sages use the water as a symbol to calm the mind because it has no depth, there is no solidity in it, but we freeze it in our will, just like we freeze water into ice. We freeze reality into illusions by our five senses, there aren&rsquo;t no real thing there, only for the five senses they appear real, but this is a frozen effect, this is an illusion we have to free ourselves from, it takes a long time to free ourself from it because we are accustomed to it from environment and the moment you get free from it, you realize that you can&rsquo;t live too long in it because it&rsquo;s too overpowering. Now I remember one time Master once said, a student came to him and says, &ldquo;Master why don&rsquo;t you give me an experience in Cosmic Consciousness, why don&rsquo;t you give me that experience where I can see the whole universe as Cosmic Light, all in motion going on?&rdquo; So the Master said to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to give it to you my son, but I don&rsquo;t think your brain can stand the shock&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s like trying to put one million volts right away into a little bulb, it will burn itself out too fast, the illumination, the shock would be too great. Now the shock would be too great on the human brain if it&rsquo;s constantly exposed 24 hours a day, 365 days to the total reality that is going on. You go out of your consciousness, you cannot&hellip; Now the little experience that some people had is so blinding that they say you can&rsquo;t stand the light because it is flowing out too fast. The closest thing that came to it to give some sort of an insight was a psychedelic techniques of LSD, that was the closest thing that came to it but even that doesn&rsquo;t come close to the reality of what&rsquo;s really occurring in Cosmic Consciousness because in Cosmic Consciousness when it comes into you, if do have the experience, you can be sitting in this room and you know exactly what&rsquo;s occurring in India right now and let&rsquo;s say you saw something in India right there and you wanted it, there would be nothing to prevent you sitting in this room, transporting it from there via consciousness, the actual thing, you can even photograph it as evidence, in pure Cosmic Consciousness this is a reality, it exists, but you couldn&rsquo;t do that with a psychedelic drug, you couldn&rsquo;t transport nothing. You&rsquo;d imagine it but when you come out of your imagination, you&rsquo;re still back in your room empty handed, but not in a cosmic state. In a cosmic state this is where we part company, one has tangible evidence, the other one does not have tangible evidence when we resort to drugs or any form of agent to induce some form of conscious experience. Audience: But there&rsquo;s one guy who said he took LSD and then he had more compassion, why did he have more compassion? Adano: This would be good if you look at it in that way. Compassion, humility, these are qualities that are normally inhibited in our mechanism from the food we eat, the environment, and the education, and the behavior not having a chance to express itself. The LSD would be a possible way of breaking that barrier and releasing it, normally it would not have a chance, it would take many physical handicaps or sufferings to bring about compassion in that man. He might have to fall down stairs a hundred times or have many people walk all over him for awhile before he would wake up to compassion. In other words it would be a slow process, pain is a slow process to get there, the LSD was just a fast, quick shot, what you call a hotrod way of getting behavior experience, follow me? All he did was he hot-rodded the brain to experience a behavior that is a genuine thing that can come through pain. Now we don&rsquo;t want to arrive at compassion through pain, we don&rsquo;t want to hotrod the brain through a chemical, we want to arrive at compassion as a natural state but you can do this naturally because it&rsquo;s already built into the mechanism. Don&rsquo;t think that the great Creator did not figure out a long time ago LSD, that He didn&rsquo;t figure out all the pains and sufferings that you can cultivate the thing naturally, you mean to tell me He didn&rsquo;t think of this already, there are more, greater LSDs yet to be discovered. Within this mechanism, all the chemical structure are in such a relationship that can be controlled and it&rsquo;s Will and it has to do with the organizing of meditation. You see you can go right inside immediately and dip into it and you can feel this thing charges up and once you dip into it, it starts to bring out peace, this is natural, this is what you are trying to get, a natural condition. Now let us say you sit down and don&rsquo;t do nothing no more, that is not what you are accomplishing, the purpose of meditation, the natural way, now if you take a drug you can feel numb, there is no tension, you&rsquo;ll be relaxed like a tranquilizer, tranquil, to make you peaceful, nice name, tranquilizers. Tranquilizers is what, semi-paralyze the organs so they are semi-numb to pain, which is suffering, to experience a sort of a suspended action that you can face the pressure of the environment. Now as soon as that tranquilizer dissipates up in the system, the pressure of the environment is still there, it hasn&rsquo;t gone away, you can&rsquo;t hold back the environment with a tranquilizer all the time, you&rsquo;ll have to learn to hold it back by your Will eventually and as you say, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we see all these things, why is it so difficult.&rdquo; Difficulty is that we haven&rsquo;t developed the Will to cope with it, to hold it back, you see it&rsquo;s the Will, that&rsquo;s the first thing we have to develop. You see if we don&rsquo;t develop the Will, then we cannot hold back, and when we develop the Will, then we surrender the Will. Audience: How do we develop the Will? Adano: The first thing to develop the Will is to do those things that you dislike to do first. 0:50 This is true, not all of us like to do the things we don&rsquo;t like to do right away first, we always procrastinate but procrastination is one of the forms that corrodes the Will. It is the corroder of the Will, it actually causes corrosion of the Will, procrastination. If you don&rsquo;t procrastinate and you exert yourself, that&rsquo;s where we come to the term gunas you know, the three type of gunas or the three modes of attitudes, a guna is only an attitude, you have your Rajasic, your Tamasic, and your Sattvic. Your Tamasic attitude is an attitude of inertia, therefore procrastination tends to produce inertia and certain foods that you eat help that Tamasic or inertia state prolong itself within your mechanism, make you sluggish. Audience: Like meat. Adano: Yes because the toxins are settling in the tissues then that causes an inertia build-up. Now your Rajasic state or your active state, that&rsquo;s the state of part activity and part sluggishness, this state helps to stimulate. This is a state where you have to exert a certain percentage of Will to be active, but to be active is to be in condition, like a boxer. This you have to take it hand, you have to train your body, train your mind, in other words you&rsquo;re always in training, an active life is a life of training, it&rsquo;s a life of discipline action. You&rsquo;re constantly disciplining this mechanism so you&rsquo;re constantly watching, not trying to outdo, but trying to understand. Then finally your Sattvic state is that attitude that allows you to perform action that are necessary for the continuance of life. That&rsquo;s why they say it&rsquo;s the pure life or pure state of purity. What is pure? No one can say what is pure but one can understand what is the continuance of life. If you have the actions that are necessary for the continuance of life, then you have what is called a universal attitude, which is a pure attitude, you have a non-profit attitude, you see, because the attitude is not something for nothing, you&rsquo;re not taking away or you&rsquo;re not hoarding anything because you are realizing yourself that here is where it is, it is pure action. So if you are in a state of inertia, then your Will is corroded by procrastination. If you are in a state of activity, your Will is in a state of discipline because discipline sharpens the Will and makes you active and if you procrastinate, the Will gets weak, that&rsquo;s inertia, that&rsquo;s Tamasic. If you are disciplining the Will and you&rsquo;re active, then that&rsquo;s Rajasic. If you&rsquo;re allowing Divine Will to guide you by Divine Grace then that&rsquo;s Sattvic. Audience: How do you do that? Audience: Do you mean intuition? Audience: I can&rsquo;t tell how do you tell when you&rsquo;re exerting your Will? Audience: She meant ego Will. Adano: Try one thing, this is only by trial because it&rsquo;s an experience you have to experience for yourself. You say, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I come to Dallas?&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Divine Mother willing I will. If She ain&rsquo;t willing then I stay where I am.&rdquo; Now, then all of a sudden last night you folks say you&rsquo;re coming and I say &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s look back at simple things that have occurred and you will see you have experienced all three levels and cannot recognize it. Recognition is spirituality, big vocabulary is not big understanding, there&rsquo;s a big difference you see. A person can have a big vocabulary as to what the spiritual life is, but he may not have a big understanding that what it really is eventually, big understanding is realization. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you have to have big words, understanding is the ability to use the thing, the ability to recognize your environment that you&rsquo;re living in and this is spirituality. Real spirituality is not church-ianity, has nothing to do with a building, it has nothing to do with high masses or all these things, it has to do with recognizing your relationship to your environment as to the source of your existence, from where you came from, why you exist in this particular environment and what purpose you are serving in this environment. If you say, well this is the way I say it because this is the way I programmed my consciousness, I used to say &ldquo;I will be there tomorrow,&rdquo; years ago and I never could get there. I wanted to go there and I never got to go there and I found out after reading the lives of great Masters, none of them would say They want anything and They never say &ldquo;I will do&rdquo; such and such a thing. Then I found out that these two principles, want and will, are corrosive elements in our lives. &ldquo;I will do&rdquo; such and such a thing, you find out you never really do it, you procrastinate, that&rsquo;s Tamasic. &ldquo;I want&rdquo; such and such a thing, that&rsquo;s Rajasic, and you never really do it, you&rsquo;re constantly spinning your wheels. Now you turn it around and you take what the great Master Jesus would say, &ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m doing right now, I&rsquo;ll continue to do, if it&rsquo;s the will of God I&rsquo;ll be taken out of it into something else, an opportunity will open up to take me out because this universe was made for me and not me for it.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;ll show you an illustration from my own life and I&rsquo;ll show you an illustration from your life. First, how long were you writing me that you wanted me to come to Dallas and calling? One thing, right? Now I did not say &ldquo;need,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t say need I say wanting, remember in this particular study of yourself, every word carries a particular force behind it. That&rsquo;s why, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word and the Word is in Man.&rdquo; Man is God already, the Word, He alone directs His life by the words He uses, therefore no realized Master would ill-choose a word for any purpose, He would never make the wrong choice with words, and if you listen to Their words specifically and analyze what They&rsquo;re talking about, you&rsquo;ll see why They can accomplish the things They accomplish and the other person cannot. The programming of the brain by words is the key to the release of the forces around you, &ldquo;As a Man thinketh in his heart, that is what he is.&rdquo; To be free from the repercussions of thinking is not to use the wrong verbal programming in your brain. Language is the key, but language is word and if you don&rsquo;t understand it, you make a mess of your own life with it because that&rsquo;s the thing that fouls you up. Nobody really fouls you up but the language you use fouls you up, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s clumsy,&rdquo; right away it&rsquo;s language that you foul up and think you&rsquo;re clumsy. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t that suggestion that does that? Adano: Alright, but it takes again the programming of someone to suggest this thing to you and you accept it or reject it so again this is involved in the language patterns. Now if you can take the language pattern and adjust it to your own advantage and use it then it&rsquo;s different, that&rsquo;s where we come into the words of semantics. The very first thing one should learn about in realization is the use of words. Audience: What if I said I need &ldquo;I need to have you come&rdquo; and I didn&rsquo;t really need you to come? That would be just suggestion wouldn&rsquo;t it. Adano: You can&rsquo;t want a need and get a result, you can need a need and get a result. A need is a real need, it doesn&rsquo;t carry want in it, it doesn&rsquo;t carry personal feeling in it, it doesn&rsquo;t carry any type of internal satisfaction in it. A need is geared by Divine Law to time, a want is not geared to time. A want is like a motor out of tune, but a need is a motor in tune, therefore to be attuned to God is to be in need of God and God provides all our needs. 1:00 In your scriptures and all your writings of the great Sages it is written, &ldquo;And all thy needs shall be provided.&rdquo; He did not say &ldquo;all your wants and wishes will be provided.&rdquo; You needs will be provided, yet your needs will gradually multiply in volume and quantity and quality, ending up as some people say &ldquo;you sure want a lot of things.&rdquo; You know I end up carrying more of my stuff than I really start out in the first place to get rid of. I try to get every kind of thing and I end up getting more and more given back to me. So do I really want it or do I need it, you see, but this is how it works. In your early stages of growth, minimize your existence to the bare needs, bring the mind to say &ldquo;I need these things,&rdquo; then just minimize it and do just those simple things and don&rsquo;t worry about how long it takes because the the life a realized Master has nothing to do with body form of length of time, it has to do with consciousness. You can be 12 years of age and you can have Cosmic Consciousness and you can be 90 years of age and have it, time has nothing to do with it, it&rsquo;s just consciousness. When I was a young boy, I wanted to be a tailor, I ended up being one after I finished it I never used the profession so I realized a want is never a need because I never used it to make a living after I graduated from it, yet I earned a good portion of the time I was studying through it and I found out that was a want, it was never a need. When you called up before, all those times, those were wants, a need had to come and need could only come through certain laws of action in the lives you were involved with, this is a need in the fact that you&rsquo;re dad-less, these are needs now, we are dealing with a life now, an actual life principle, when the person is on the borderline between what is called suffering, frustration, and joy. There is where need exists, at the particular balance between the frustration, a pain, and a joy. The joy is in you and in your mother and in your sister. The frustration is in your father, he doesn&rsquo;t know what is occurring after the operation which was a pain, but the joy is gonna be when he realizes or know now, from another source, that what he has passed through is turning out for the best, you see what I mean. Now take the joy and the pain of your own, you called several times and those were wants, yet I remember receiving a letter from you and you said &ldquo;gee that guy never replies to my letters.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll put it this way, I read the thing, but I give it enough time to mature first before I reply to it because I know by the time I reply to it, those very things that are being asked in your letter will be experienced, but until they&rsquo;re experienced when I come with the answers for it, you wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate it, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand it because you have to have the answers after the experience. If you had the answers before the experience, you&rsquo;re prejudiced, you may think you were hypnotized into your answers, you see what I mean? You must have the experience first to evaluate when someone points out or accentuates. The reason a Guru or a Teacher exists or a spiritual person exists not only to bring you back to God realization, is to accentuate those things that represent God realization. &ldquo;Should I give tribute to Caesar,&rdquo; was asked by Jesus you know and He says &ldquo;Give Me the coin, let Me look at it. Whose inscription is this?&rdquo; &ldquo;This is Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well give it to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give unto God what belongs to God.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say you shouldn&rsquo;t pay taxes, right? Whose money we using? Uncle Sam prints his big face across the thing so he might as well get what belongs to him, actually he&rsquo;s only loaning it to you to survive, but what belongs to God still belongs to God, those values of living, those truths about yourself, these are things that need to be accentuated, these are things that need to hold onto because under any trial or physical strain or pain or emotional upset, it is only those things that you have been aware of that are true to your nature and have been accentuated by others along that same path, those are the values that are going to stand you good. Those are the things that will make you realize &ldquo;Lives of great Men all remind us we should make our lives sublime,&rdquo; not make our pockets lined, &ldquo;make our lives sublime and they going ahead of us,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re living through these experiences before us, &ldquo;leave footprints on the sands of time.&rdquo; Make some impression in our mind so that time passes easy for us, that time is not a boredom, we don&rsquo;t live in a state of boredom, we live in a state of full enjoyment of time, timeless time, we can appreciate the timeless-ness of it now, you see, because we are alive now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, now, and whenever everything is said and done and you get a blow on the head, it&rsquo;s still going to be now and when you wake up from the blow, it&rsquo;s still going to be in the now. So the thing is we gotta realize it is the joy of aliveness, the joy of happiness is the thing. No, her imagination is not playing no tricks on her, she has had inner experience. See many of us travel on the inner planes while we sleep you know, we have astral projection. Remember this, when God created this body or when God enclosed the Soul, see we must understand what we are saying, He says, &ldquo;Let Us make Man in Our own image and likeness, male and female create He them, and He breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living body,&rdquo; not true, &ldquo;a living Soul,&rdquo; the last word was Soul, he became a living Soul. Man is not a body, Man is Soul, but it takes meditation to prove it to him that he is Soul, otherwise he cannot prove it, you see. Now when we sleep we experience a form of traveling out of our mechanism. Now this Soul mechanism is a composite, it&rsquo;s a composite like a three legged stool, no leg is more important than the other. In this composite of Soul, the body is not more important than the mind, and the mind is not more important than the spirit that holds it together, yet the whole thing is Soul, it vibrates as Soul, that&rsquo;s what he is. Now this realization is what he is trying to get at, we&rsquo;re all trying to realize this composite, this inter-relationship between the body, the mind, and the spirit, how this thing works as a unit. Now if God breathed the breath of life into Man, Man became a living Soul, Man is linked to God only by breath. Now that doesn&rsquo;t say you must regulate your breath, that doesn&rsquo;t say you must have some form of interference with breath, you&rsquo;re linked to God by breath in the form of Soul, but you must be able to recognize this linkage in order to be free from this imprisonment of your body and this recognition comes by awareness and they give a method of how to recognize by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt with Man.&rdquo; 1:10 Sound, so by being aware of the sound is being aware of breath at the same time as being aware of Soul at the same time and meditation is a link to it. Now in sleep we do separate, we have an astral body going out which is an electrical field charge, it goes out and travels maintaining a hole in itself. The astral body is a composite of 19 elements, the same 16 chemical elements you have in the physical body plus the element of feeling, circulation, crystallization, the five senses: smell, touch, hear, and taste. All these are all locked up in us and it maintains itself in an electrical charge and it&rsquo;s aware of itself where it is and it travels. Now if someone has the same experience and they&rsquo;re traveling, they will meet and recognize and they link up on that inner plane and they may not be conscious of it while it&rsquo;s happening. When they come back into the waking state, they may have a reaction and they can recognize it and they may see it, then they can understand it. Now the purpose of recognition is strictly to realize that we are citizens of two universes, a universe of the physical existence and the universe of electrical existence and that we have access to both universes at the same time, like Saint Paul, he says, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing because I live and die daily in the Lord.&rdquo; In other words, he&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;I understand your involvement in the five sense world, in the world of the five senses, but I live and die, I experience another world while I&rsquo;m in the five senses too, I pass through another existence in another realm&rdquo; and he is in the Lord, he&rsquo;s in this universe, he&rsquo;s experiencing a daily shutoff of the five senses and stepping into another experience, another realm, to experience it and therefore he can claim to be a citizen of two universes at the same time. Now meditation helps us to go through that, dreaming is another way to go through it, the door is open to us by either dream or meditation or some other agent external, but never permanent. The only thing that is permanent to us is by meditation because true meditation we pass through it carte blanche because God is already done give you what is called a credit card to come into it, He didn&rsquo;t give you a credit card to go in by the other techniques. In other words, the other ones aren&rsquo;t really genuine to the extent that it remain with you, meditation will remain with you permanently because it is the actual science of contacting the Soul. Audience: Could I ask a question? Can you us who our Master is? Adano: God is the Master, Men are merely reflections of this awareness in Man who have achieved that level of awareness, the disciple will know his Master because when the disciple is ready, the Master will always be there. The thing is this, how to recognize your Master. You see everyone has a Master in the human form, God is the genuine Master that comes through that form, but how can you recognize him? See Master may not even reveal himself to you that he&rsquo;s your Master because this is an imposition of this force, he allows you to feel it. If you feel it you know it, it&rsquo;s in there, and when he&rsquo;s in your presence you can sense it, that&rsquo;s another principle. Now there are Masters who have been coming to this country and they will be teaching meditation, they&rsquo;ll perform the surgery of initiation and you will meet them, the thing is would you be prepared for it when it happens, would you be able to profit from that experience. Many people meet a Master and they cannot profit from the experience, you see, they&rsquo;re unprepared for it and the Master has to come back another time into their lives. It is being prepared is the thing you see, &ldquo;when the student is ready, the Master will be there&rdquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t have to say in the presence of the Master too long (gap in tape) &hellip; this Divine Ego says &ldquo;Thou shalt have none other gods but Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;You see Me you see God.&rdquo; Now this is a Divine Ego, it has nothing to do with the limitations of the body (inaudible). The thing is that you&rsquo;re trying to see is why a Master pick a businessman first as a disciple, just like how Jesus picked on Peter. Of all the people He picked Peter, He picked up the bill. You see a Master is pure intuition, that is what He is, He&rsquo;s a living embodiment of pure intuition, knowing directly independent of the five senses all the time. Now the closest brother to intuition is willpower and intuition always seeks willpower and on willpower it builds a realized individual, but willpower is limited because there is another force within all of us that transcends, eventually transcends, willpower and goes beyond and gives us intuition a whole lot easier that we don&rsquo;t have this developed in us and this is love or devotion, the natural law of the heart, the natural feeling, this is hard to develop. People think you&rsquo;re kinda oddball you know, you&rsquo;re oozing out with love, it would scare you, kinda nuts or something, you&rsquo;re oozing with love. Sheer devotion is all love, this is greater than willpower because this will pull you up faster because sheer devotion is recognition and this what John had over Peter. When Peter wanted to find out from the Master Jesus, and this is in the life of Peter, John, and Jesus, we see the three phases of Man&rsquo;s own nature, we see intuition, we see willpower, and we see love at work. Now intuition builds upon willpower, yet intuition is closely nipping to devotion or love and can transmit easier to love, but intuition cannot leave anything substantial because love can be hurt very easy so it uses will as something substantial in the physical world to leave it to. So if He was going to leave His teachings to somebody to carry on, He&rsquo;d have to have a man of dynamic will who can talk them down to the truth you see. So He leaves that knowledge to a man of dynamic will, but He transmits all the experiences. There&rsquo;s a big difference of leaving your knowledge to a person who has the will to carry it on, to see it applied, than to leaving or transmitting your experiences to a person who will experience these things in themselves and that&rsquo;s love and devotion. He transmitted many of the mystical experiences to John, but He transmitted His work or His ideal to Peter to carry on. Now when you meet your Guru, you will discover for yourself which phase are you in. Are you i the will phase or are you in the devotion stage because He will transmit this you, He will awaken something in you and you will recognize it. 1:20 When He awaken the will in you, you will see it, you find you have enough vitality to go because He&rsquo;s going to aggravate you, He&rsquo;s going to cause you to want to resist Him like my friend who&rsquo;s come to visit me, you see. That and an aggravation is a sort of a resistance, whereas devotion there is no resistance, it&rsquo;s like water, it just flows you see. Adano sings &ldquo;Looking for a home&hellip;&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a good sign, life, you see you have everything complete tonight, you have the flowers that have life, you have the fruit gives life, you have human beings that life flows perennially, you needed one more thing from the animal kingdom, here we have it (inaudible) from the animal kingdom. &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; Mineral kingdom, vegetable kingdom, human kingdom, animal kingdom, insect kingdom. You see we don&rsquo;t understand the principles of these great Masters when They were talking, They were talking not in the sense we think They are talking, They are talking of something vast and very scientific. &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; Now this has a threefold explanation, it can mean when two or three people get together. Now we assume right away He meant three people, you see we make the assumption because we want to make the assumption we don&rsquo;t need the assumption, we want to make this assumption that when two or three gathered together it&rsquo;s two or three people who get together, He&rsquo;s got to be in their midst with us, not realizing what it really is, we are wanting this particular view of the thing. &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in their midst,&rdquo; when two or three good Christians from one same church get together, Jesus has got to be present, so &ldquo;in My name&rdquo; He really wasn&rsquo;t talk about any of these things. We live in so many different kingdoms of consciousness or planes of existence, so many different levels of life that the moment a man of truth or anyone who is interested in the truth of his existence, the moment he gets together in the consciousness of &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the consciousness of his own self, and to listen to his own name, that&rsquo;s the vibration &ldquo;in My name,&rdquo; that is cosmic vibration, that&rsquo;s the vibration or the frequency of the &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness in you, when the three levels of existence will come into focus, that is the mineral existence, animal existence, human existence, when these are synchronized, that&rsquo;s why we call this Satsang, a meeting of Souls, that was a Soul that went through, this is a Soul, and you and I are Souls. See he&rsquo;s happy now. When they are gathered in My name, in this Cosmic frequency, because where are we going to gather in the first place. Not in a motel, we&rsquo;re gathering in the whole Cosmic arena Life, &ldquo;Right here in the universe of life, there am I in their midst&rdquo; because He&rsquo;s not over there or out there, He&rsquo;s in the midst, He&rsquo;s in the here-ness, in the now-ness. He who? Life itself, the Cosmic Life itself is present all the time as the sound frequencies passing through us in the form of flower, Man, beast, and it is living relationship that is spirituality because the thing must be living, the thing must be a living experience to see it going in simplicity, not in complication. It&rsquo;s to see because living experience is a simple thing, truth is simple but difficult to comprehend. The mere fact that he crawled right through all the door, came in right in the Satsanga, he was blessed, realize that the Soul of any creature&hellip; if a cat came around and I&rsquo;ve had many cats come around, the moment they come to a Satsanga and this is what a Satsanga is, the moment they come to a Satsanga, their vibrations are lifted up because we are speaking at a frequency involving the highest possible thoughts Man can generate as to the origin of his existence and the nature of his existence and that creature is partaking of those vibrations all the time. Here he&rsquo;s coming back, you see, he hasn&rsquo;t decided where he&rsquo;s looking for a home yet (laughter). Audience: And yet he&rsquo;s not conscious of being lifted up? Adano: Many of us are like that when the Guru is with us. You see the Master does not shock you into reality that He&rsquo;s lifting you up. He&rsquo;s lifting you up in subtle ways, that&rsquo;s why He does not have to be in your presence, He can use another human being to flow in. Like tonight, I&rsquo;m not helping you, it&rsquo;s the Masters that flow in through my consciousness that are helping you. (Laughter, maybe an animal came back into the room). See, he&rsquo;s raised his evolution, you see how he&rsquo;s trying to show you a lesson, he&rsquo;s teaching you a very good lesson. &ldquo;Though we grovel in the earth, we must learn to fly at night.&rdquo; In other words, though we live in our five senses in the physical world, we must learn to free ourselves and fly. &ldquo;Happy is the Soul that can fly.&rdquo; Everybody is looking for Soul liberation, what is Soul liberation? The ability to step into the next realm while in the physical frame because there is the realm we eventually will live in when we forget the frame and flying, why every man feels that he has this ability, you don&rsquo;t know why, flying is an indication of the astral body going through many times in and out of it in sleep or in dream or meditation. Flying, the need is there, it&rsquo;s built into us that we have a portion of our mechanism that takes flight under certain levels of awareness and Soul flight, this is where the word comes in now, Soul flight. How does the Soul travel? By airplane, by walking, by swimming, by running, no, by flight, you see. Audience: Where does it go? Adano: It goes into the here-ness, the here-ness, that&rsquo;s where it goes. So in other words, the Soul goes nowhere, there is nowhere for the Soul to go because it&rsquo;s omnipresent already you see, but you have to recognize it. Recognizing omnipresence is recognizing tranquility as an endlessness within you. Any time you put a limitation to this tranquility, you have to open your eyes. See like our friend here, she&rsquo;s immersed in tranquility, the moment she opened her eyes she put an end to it, right? The moment you go back in, it&rsquo;s endless. Audience: (inaudible). I said your tranquility would be endless if you go back inside and the moment you open your eyes, the tranquility is ended. When we&rsquo;re inside, it&rsquo;s endless, when we&rsquo;re outside it&rsquo;s broken. Now the Sages don&rsquo;t say we that we must live inside all the time, that&rsquo;s not the purpose of going in, the purpose of going in is (long pause), bringing it out, that is the purpose of going in. You see you must be able to go inside and bring this force out so you can live with it, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for, otherwise what is the sense of going in, the sense of going in would just go to sleep. You see the joy that you experience from a good sleep and a good dream, that same joy should be able now to transfer itself from that state into the waking state and it should transfer itself from the immobile state to the mobile walking state, this is the pure consciousness. The pure consciousness is motion that you are able to carry love with you all the time and it flows, it&rsquo;s never stopping, then you realize this universe was made for you, there is nothing else here that has a purpose because the real purpose of Man&rsquo;s existence is the realization that he is Soul and that everything in this universe was made for him but not to be enslaved by the thing, you see. 1:30 If we are enslaved by it, then we are made for the thing and that&rsquo;s to say &ldquo;well if I don&rsquo;t have a job tomorrow, I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; but if jobs are made for Man, it makes no difference if you have one tomorrow or not, you&rsquo;ll always have a job. I&rsquo;ll give you an illustration, you folks came down because there was a need this trip, before there was no need it was want, right, and we generate enough desire, enough activity to get the fires going, you exert the will, then you made the first step into action but when you asked me the questions last night, &ldquo;should we come?&rdquo; Audience: I said &ldquo;should I come?&rdquo; Adano: Right, you&rsquo;re representing everybody concerned and I said &ldquo;Yes, Divine Mother willing,&rdquo; She sure poured down a bunch of rain this morning to clear up the atmosphere right away, but this is what I&rsquo;m trying to say. Now you remember before I went to work, I wasn&rsquo;t looking for work. Audience: (Laughter) That was the criticism, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not working.&rdquo; Adano: I&rsquo;m the yogi that don&rsquo;t work so what kind of yogi are you in this modern society so already we shall prove really if the Divine Law works or it doesn&rsquo;t work or this is just a bunch of nonsense we are all building up in the imagination. I got a job and the name of my boss is Wade so I said &ldquo;now how else can I get something better than that.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m wading through the financial difficulties of this world they&rsquo;re talking so much about and type of work I&rsquo;m doing is called &ldquo;corrosion control,&rdquo; before I was getting rid of the corrosion of the Soul and now I gotta get rid of the corrosion of the metals. So I said, &ldquo;this job is made for me, I&rsquo;m not made for it.&rdquo; What name was more appropriate for the problem that I was supposed to be facing, as everyone says &ldquo;a financial problem?&rdquo; Here I got a job owned by a company called Wade, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wading through the financial difficulties, that is the problem with everybody&rdquo; so that took care of that point. Now all around I seen this particular law works if you&rsquo;re willing to cope with the thing and don&rsquo;t fight it, that&rsquo;s all that matters, to cope with the thing, you don&rsquo;t fight the thing, it works. Audience: But it hard for those of us who still haven&rsquo;t really done anything to face that we are going to have to take care of ourselves somehow. If we were already doing something, it would be different, that we haven&rsquo;t done anything, we&rsquo;re still dependent on our parents. It&rsquo;s hard not to think in the future, what&rsquo;s going to happen&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1965-june-2---man-is-soul">1965 June 2 - Man is Soul</h2>
<p>Adano65_06_02ManisSoulQ1RRNW6 - The question was asked a little while ago, &ldquo;Why is it I can&rsquo;t get past a certain stage in my development? I can understand the subject intellectually, but I don&rsquo;t get the experience to back it up?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m gonna give the reason why the student cannot get past the intellectual stage into the spiritual experience because there is a basic law there. That law is sometimes called Satan, Devil, or the Divine Examiner, but it is called by the metaphysician or cosmic science, the Principle of Ramm and this particular part is called the Primary Principle, like the primary function in a coil because it involves a particular force in the mechanism and the second part is SLR. This is called the Secondary. R stands for Resistance, the basic intrinsic resistance in all structure by the very art of creation exists as is. God cannot destroy His devils because He is devil manifest also, you see? He cannot come into manifestation if there is no basic resistance in the manifestation. So how can He destroy what we call devil? How can creation begin without intrinsic resistance? That&rsquo;s why the law of resistance exists or Ramm, it&rsquo;s a principal that any manifestation involves resistance. &ldquo;Fiat Lux,&rdquo; to break the resistance of darkness, light was necessary. It&rsquo;s already there, basic, part of us, will be us, but this resistance you&rsquo;ll find does not last, it is a period only. That&rsquo;s why the scriptures say &ldquo;all things comes to pass.&rdquo; But not to stay, that was left out in the writings. All these things will come to pass, but not to stay. Because all things are moving in the cosmological time sequence with their intrinsic resistance. Now, resistance lasts only for a period until you recognize it as resistance and if you don&rsquo;t recognize it as resistance, psychological, physical, or spiritual, then it will continue to possess and haunt you, obsess you, but it can&rsquo;t stay too long either because the very law of nature it is moving, it&rsquo;s not static, it&rsquo;s in the process of moving. So we move from resistance to Adjustment or Adaptation, where we learn to adapt ourselves. So &ldquo;A&rdquo; stands for Adaptation where we learn to adapt, in spite of ourselves we do adapt. Now even adaptation can&rsquo;t last too long, that changes too and it changes into Mutation, which really means change, mutation or change, so we say we live in a world of changes, constant changes, but this is also for only a certain period and when that change has worked itself out, we have now it&rsquo;s called Mold or Pattern and it&rsquo;s set in its primary function as Life, the input of the function of Life is set. Now we have to have the output some function, which is the Secondary, the runout. From the molded pattern which doesn&rsquo;t last too long either, we come into a period called Saturation, we get bored and as we get bored of what we get molded into, it begins to drag upon us and that dragging is called a Lag. Now this Lag or Boredom state it is a non-incentive state which most of us do fall into. Right in this same lag, the period of no incentive is coming into the period of incentive. It&rsquo;s because in here this incentive does really exist, it exists in Lag. Though you feel you have no incentive in that state, there is where incentive really exists because we get initiative coming out of it, so we get a new impetus. So out of lag which is called Night of the Soul by the Sages or Saints, we get impetus, a spark, new incentive, new ID because it&rsquo;s churning in the lag period it&rsquo;s churning in our consciousness and we have the impetus and we move out with that new impetus into Recurrence, a new cycle. Audience: I was going to say is this a cycle that you&rsquo;ll find yourself going through at different times, maybe at different levels. Adano: Yes, the cycle is based on a spiral movement from the zero point or central point of One, the darkness is the back of the blackboard, the white dot represents the central point of light moving out by intrinsic resistance, adapting, changing, and moving around gradually until it comes back in line with the central point of One, but you&rsquo;ll notice it doesn&rsquo;t do like this. Here&rsquo;s the central point of One moving out and returning back to central point of One and repeating itself back over and over like that, but that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s doing. As it moves in line with the central point of One in the first diagram as shown, the law of recurrence spirals out because impetus is responsible for it, so it doesn&rsquo;t connect, right there it widens out into an arc and that comes back again to the line of impetus and reaches out again and returns back to the line of impetus. So we have Spirit, Man is not Spirit, he&rsquo;s not body, he&rsquo;s not mind, he is Soul. Until he knows he&rsquo;s Soul, he cannot free himself from these lines of impetus, he cannot free himself to have experience from the intellectual concept of his Being to the actual experience of his being. You see the reason why the student has a difficulty experiencing himself. Until he know this is going on all the time, he&rsquo;s living in this particular state when he can accept his consciousness, accept his level of experience in the law and realize that each phase of the law is based on time, Cosmic Time, not our chronological time. 0:10 Audience: Because it could be quicker or dragged out depending on (inaudible) Adano: That is right, it&rsquo;s capsulated or extended by consciousness. As I said before early in the evening, Man is Soul and God breathed the Breath of Life into him and the breath of Life is the accelerator and this is the thing that can capsulate time or extend out time and it&rsquo;s in us. Now, the ancient Sages say Cosmic Consciousness is directly liked to breath mastery or hyper oxygenation, not to holding in of the breath or holding it out, it is this atomic knowledge of the oxygen in the mechanism and its upward and downward movements which are responsible for this transformation by a hot and cold temperature change. As we go up this hot and cold temperature change in our mechanism and more and more scientists will discover this phenomena, we will see we are repeating all these same phases of the same law. Audience: Each time he reaches the lag place, you could certainly lose hope if you didn&rsquo;t know what this is exactly doing. Adano: Right, this is a cyclic thing and it&rsquo;s established and therefore God is at rest now. He has created in six days, as we say six days cosmological time, and on the seventh day He rest. Rest, He came to recurrence. He left the law here and from now on we have to move. He cannot judge, condemn, there&rsquo;s nothing to punish because Jesus says when He was alive, He does not judge. Now when Jesus went up the mountain to be tempted of the devil, most people thing He went there to be tempted, it was because He was working out every facet of His nature and trying to probe in every facet of His nature, cosmically speaking, where the resistance is, the adjustment, the mutations, the molding, the saturation, the lag, and the recurrences were, so He was free. The last test is the test of pride, when He was asked to bow down and worship Baal. Man does worship Baal because he reaches out to possess, control humanity all the time, he wants to control society with his thinking and the greatest challenge to the Realized Man is this power to possess and dominate by the power of thought. If your power of thought can dominate the universe and hold all men in sway and respect you, you have the greatest control and this is the challenge of the law of Ram. Audience: And at some stage you will probably&hellip; Adano: Yes you will be subject to this test, you will be tried by this Divine Examiner because this is where you try to compete with the Cosmic Consciousness, the Creative Force. Now we are given dominion over the universe, but not ownership of the universe and to have somebody bow down automatically puts you in command of them and you are in possession of them like a slave. Man cannot be slave to another man in no form because we are all Souls so in His Cosmic evolution He&rsquo;s got to realize that every aspect of his Cosmic Consciousness must be hammered out. So it takes 40 days if you&rsquo;re really sincere with yourself, everyone who sat out through the process in 40 days can hammer it out or in 40 years can hammer it out. Kriya Yoga allows you to do it in 40 years naturally so we say 40 years of Kriya Yoga, you can hammer out your consciousness into Cosmic Consciousness. In 40 days you can speed it up, that is like Buddha and Jesus and several other men speeded up in 40 days or you live out one million years of births and rebirths to hammer it out in a body that is not subject to disease in any form or other. So we see until we understand the law of Ram, we cannot experience these laws of Soul Consciousness as an actual experience, we can only intellectually understand it. We have to live these experiences as Soul. Each level we live it, we get a glimpse of our nature and the ability to trigger off this energy or power by the mind. We then realize this is where we&rsquo;re going. Any questions so far? Audience: You mean you have to come back until you hammer than out? Adano: Yes, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time,&rdquo; this is what Jesus points out and He can&rsquo;t help us any more than we can help ourselves. &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; The repetition of repeating this principle is there all the time. Now where does the Cosmic Man step off of this Spiral that is the question, you understand? Where does he step out of it, how can he free himself from this spiral? He steps out of it by stepping across in a direct route right back to the central part of himself going inwards, &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and all these things are added unto you.&rdquo; You step right out from the point of impetus right back into the point of resistance. Audience: Now you lost me. Adano: At this point of impetus, if you retrace yourself back directly, how you got to where you are in your problems, you&rsquo;ve stepped out of it. Audience: You mean sort of like the psychological process of bringing the problem up to the subconscious and viewing it in the light of your understanding? Adano: Yes, exactly, the spiritual man has to go that route and he can step right out back into the (inaudible) and this what you call cosmic psychoanalysis, knowing himself, seeking the kingdom of God within himself. In other words, he has to learn how to build a temple, the Temple of God, building the temple of God I&rsquo;ll draw the pattern how he builds the Temple of God in himself by stepping out. This is exactly the law he&rsquo;s confronted with and he has to live this law but he builds by stepping across, that&rsquo;s why &ldquo;to him that overcometh I will not send forth a second time,&rdquo; he has to overcome the desire patterns. See the desire patterns are responsible for resistance, adjustments, or adaptations, mutations, mold, saturation, lag, and recurrence. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t he rebuilding new desire patterns. Adano: The Cosmic Man is living in a desire-less state, only at the dictate of Cosmic Will, he does not live for his own will. Audience: Well isn&rsquo;t there a necessity for desiring to live under Cosmic Will. Adano: That is what you call the Cosmic Desire, the Cosmic Desire is that the Creation follow the Creative Will, not that the Creation desire to follow Creative Will, the Creation recognizes Creative Will. It should recognize Creative Will taking place in all its activities, not that it should crave to go back to the Creative Will and submerge to it and surrender to it, when it does that it is still lacking. It should come to the understanding right away that the Creative Will is in it and the Creative Will is responsible for it. It should begin to recognize that immediately without having to go on craving for it. Audience: I&rsquo;m lost. Adano: You are in the body with unfulfilled desires and you are exposed to knowledge that the Creative Will is supposed to guide your life. Therefore you crave to go back to the Creative Will to guide your life. Now, until you have overcome spiritual life, you are craving to go back. 0:20 Audience: Oh what you have to have is realization that you are that. Adano: Right, you have to realize that you are Soul, the moment you realize Soul there is no going back you see. You are Soul, you&rsquo;re no longer body, mind, and spirit so you broke the chain. &ldquo;I AM that I AM.&rdquo; &ldquo;I and my Father are One.&rdquo; These are all realizations, affirmations of the fact you are Soul. Audience: But realization of the fact is something else. Adano: Realization of the fact that you are Soul comes building it now. &ldquo;Build me a temple that I may dwell in the midst thereof.&rdquo; To build a temple, you got to have the basement and the basement is called &ldquo;attitude.&rdquo; Building the first basement in your life is attitude. Your parents should have the attitude so that their offspring will carryover attitude right away, you see? Now a Master is born with parents who already got the attitude, you never hear of a Master being born to parents without the right attitude. The attitude is there, they cannot build a temple, they couldn&rsquo;t give the offspring any impetus so they themselves got to build for the offspring so attitude is established as the basis. Then the next line up is interest. This cannot die in your life, you cannot let interest die out, so there is no stagnant moment in your life, you see what I mean? Because there is no moment in your Soul life where you&rsquo;re gonna lose interest, all life becomes interest because all life is Soul now in a bigger scale and from that you close up the next angle in service. You are forced to render service. With this service then you close the ceiling. With your next knowledge, astro psychology or astrology, which sets the foundation for time now. Every master has to know time thoroughly because He cannot work outside of time, He works with time, not with clock time, cosmic time. So He knows astro psychology or astrology and He builds from there parapsychology or knowledge of the extra sensory nature. He knows this properly because He is going to differentiate between the mystic or the fakirs and the true Saint now so He closes the triangle by meditation, the science of meditation. At the apex He puts what is called the weather vane and that is called Self-realization and He has built the temple, He turns in any direction He&rsquo;s cosmically conscious all the time, it makes no difference now where He is, He is in Self-realization all the time. Audience: Now if the very first basement is attitude, there are 100,000 attitudes, what are you describing? Adano: The first attitude that is established, and has to be established, is Love and the only real attitude. All attitudes are subdivisions that lead up to Love, but Love means this, it means evolved. To love is to evolve, to go out, to unfold, to let go, and if you don&rsquo;t have then attitude then we have to pray for the attitude for unfolding, getting away from being static, getting away from being fixed, getting away from being concrete. This is an attitude and the only attitude to build this temple properly. As long as you evolve, your interests will automatically reach out because everything becomes interest now, everything is love now reaching out and if you&rsquo;re evolving, which is love, you&rsquo;ve got to render service. You see now you&rsquo;re evolving out, you&rsquo;re bound to evolve out, you&rsquo;ve moving out from love, the basic attitude, you&rsquo;ve got to spread your wings out, you gotta reach and if you spread out, you&rsquo;re gonna run into people with their problems, people are only born you know at certain time, their problems are involved with astro-psychology, you have to understand that in your relationship with yourself. And from there you have to be able to understand the extrasensory nature because they&rsquo;re going to evolve out too, you have to understand them that way. Audience: (Inaudible), the higher octaves than the lower ones. Adano: Right, knowing that you need something to feed your spiritual life and you need to know meditation in order to speed this spiritual life. If you don&rsquo;t have the meditation then your spiritual life is empty. It&rsquo;s not activities in the church alone you know, it&rsquo;s activity in the inner temple, that inner peace, that inner glow, that inner joy, and the grace of God descending, then we have realization, that is the light opens up, consciousness is there, and peace profound is passing through you. Audience: Is that the same as the prodigal son returning? Adano: Prodigal son returns? Yes, this is actually the prodigal son returning back to his father himself, but you see the thing in the prodigal son story, a great deal has been made of the prodigal son and the slop he ate and the fatted calf his father gave but they mis-cite on the true meaning. The thing that they should have made emphasis on, &ldquo;My son!&rdquo; &ldquo;My Father!&rdquo; Audience: Relationship. Adano: Right, relationship, the fact that no fear, no rebuke, no fear that daddy will rebuke me, and no fear that the son has gone away, all these things should drop off at that moment, &ldquo;This is still my flesh and blood, this is my offspring, this is my being, I see myself, I too might have done it, because my face was good I didn&rsquo;t do it, but my child did it.&rdquo; This is the thing that gotta come out, that the father has to reach out and the mother has gotta reach out, this is the part that is more important because there we see the attitude, the very basic attitude is there, it&rsquo;s reaching back, you see. If that attitude is always there, then the child is not afraid and we look back at our Father, the Cosmic Father or the Cosmic Mother, we know He is Love and we feel it when we turn to Him. Even if we don&rsquo;t understand and we still have connections with past IDs that are not (inaudible) right now in our daily life, we can still pray for that Love, we can still surrender and become humble enough to feel this Love. So one of the Beatitudes, attitudes of Being, that&rsquo;s what they really mean, the Be-attitudes, the attitudes of Being, &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not.&rdquo; Murmur, don&rsquo;t complain, meekly wait but don&rsquo;t complain. The father should be willing to accept the child coming back, that the child would be willing to reach out and accept Daddy, you see, for Love&rsquo;s sake. Not because he&rsquo;s a son, not because he&rsquo;s father, not because one is superior over the other by authority of ages, but the fact that there&rsquo;s Love still going on. 0:30 But in Man&rsquo;s relationship with God, this love is even greater. Audience: Where did they get this bid idea that God is always punishing everyone. Adano: That&rsquo;s true, but God judges no man. Audience: There was the other son who had this feeling that he was at a disadvantage to the other son who came back and had already spent the part of the inheritance and for a long time I had difficulty understanding the justice of this other son going out and having spent all his inheritance and came back and still was accepted by the father. Adano: If the father accepts his offspring because one is wayward and one is not wayward, the father&rsquo;s heart or the mother&rsquo;s heart or in the Guru&rsquo;s heart for that matter is the one who turns against the Love that has been there that shelters it and prepares it to grow and nourish it, that ache is great. Now therefore that love becomes stronger and reaches out, when you have a child, supposed you have a set of twins in your hands, one don&rsquo;t cry and one cries, which one gets the attention first? Audience: The one that cries. Adano: So Master used to say, &ldquo;We are all naughty children, ran away from our cosmic parents that cried and let them satisfy you with the juju of love, let them give you the candy of love, Divine Love, let them put back Divine Love back in your mouth you see, then we run away you see. Now the Masters who did&rsquo;t run away were the angels. Now if the angels didn&rsquo;t go away from the Father and they&rsquo;re all up there, there&rsquo;s great rejoicing when the wayward human being returns back. The joy of one repentant Soul , listen carefully, the joy of one repentant Soul is equal to the Joy a million angels and the Upanishads will tell you that the Soul that has realized Its cosmic nature is greater than the joy of all the gods and goddesses and all the fairies and everything on the higher hierarchy that every walked away from God or walked away from Its cosmic home. They have lived in this protective aura and know not the trials and hardships of want. So the boy who came back, his joy was being reinstated. Now the joy of the other one need not be offended because he was always reinstated, he was always there, he never did anything not to be reinstated. Audience: Can you demonstrate that with the sheep in the fold? Adano: Right, the problem is this, you can only exert Love when there is tragedy in one form or other, more than normal. Normal love there is no tragedy, there is no pressure, so you love them and you take it for granted, they will obey, they do everything. Let there be friction in some for or other then there is tug-of-war in your feelings and right away hate comes in, indifference comes in, self-centeredness comes in, these are the things that are going to come in first, never love. You&rsquo;re hoping that they may change. Alright, if they change, what do you feel now, greater love than you ever felt before for the person, don&rsquo;t you feel a sigh of relief? What is a sigh of relief, a relief from all the different frictions that were going on in you, &ldquo;Oh boy I wish it turns out perfect now,&rdquo; but this is how the love nature can be, there is no way for it to go out and this is the reason why we don&rsquo;t get the experience because we are trapped in that law of Ramm and if we recognize that we are trapped in it, then all we have to do is let each period work itself out. You know so many days it will take for resistance, so many days it will take to adjust, so many days for change, so many days to mold, so many days for saturation, so many days for lag, you get a new idea, new impetus, and then recurrence. Audience: But that can be speeded up and illuminated when you begin to building on this other&hellip; Adano: Yes, by going back into yourself, seeking the Kingdom of God which is within you, you first establish attitude, that&rsquo;s why He said there are only two commandments He gave and all the Sages were giving the same two commandments, &ldquo;Love thy neighbor as thyself and love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, with all thy heart, and Soul.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s still love, the first basic attitude you have to establish, out of Love we evolve, we can&rsquo;t have anything else but that and we evolve by interest first. There has to be an interest that pulls you into the evolution and that interest makes you render service. Now the moment you start rendering service, you&rsquo;re gonna run into problems, you&rsquo;re gonna feel people are against you and you have their interests at heart, you&rsquo;re feeling the love and compassion for Man and you want to render service, but if you don&rsquo;t know how to work with them, you&rsquo;re lost, you&rsquo;re at sea so you need astro-psychology or astrology as it is called, you need to know the time, moments these people exist in relationship to you. Now when you get past that stage, you begin to understand the para-psychology or the extra sensory nature of Man, then you realize that this doesn&rsquo;t bring the peace in the Man, that meditation now is the one avenue which he has to travel up to gain inner peace, inner contentment, and he begins to see his true nature by closing the apex of the temple he&rsquo;s building. So we see the weather vane representing Self-realization, he can turn in any angle he wants now, from any angle, north, south, east, or west, he&rsquo;s a free man, free Soul, Jivanmukta. Now we understand why we arrive at Jivanmukta, freed Soul, freed while living. Don&rsquo;t let the long waves get in our consciousness because it&rsquo;s like living our life to die. If we are maturing at 21 years of age and we&rsquo;re supposed to live 7 cycles of 21 by natural law, we should live 147 years and this is by law of natural principles. So if you jam your brains with different thought waves to die at 60 by insurance policies or statistics or 70 and so forth, you&rsquo;re already locking off your life. So you&rsquo;re actually gearing your whole consciousness to shutdown, you&rsquo;re gearing it to breakdown, it&rsquo;s not gearing to buildup and you have two forces in the body, one is called anabolic, the buildup rate of the body, and the other one is called catabolic, the break down rate of the body. At a certain age, from birth to a certain age physically speaking, you&rsquo;re anabolic rates are working terrifically fast till they get set at 21, then they start to taper off and start to work slower. Audience: Is that only because of a race kind of a thought? Adano: Yes, it&rsquo;s based on a race thought, it&rsquo;s based on a brain wave jamming by society, strictly that is the cause of it. All the Masters could do these things, what is Giri Bala and all these things, what is SRF teaching, it is exactly the same thing that scientists will recognize it too because they&rsquo;re coming that way. Audience: The Masters don&rsquo;t achieve it either. Adano: Yes They do, right now they have Masters living that don&rsquo;t die, They&rsquo;re right in your Autobiography (of a Yogi), there&rsquo;s a Master called Babaji over several thousand years old and you can see Him if you want to see Him. 0:40 Audience: Not in this body form. Adano: Yes, He&rsquo;s in this physical body, I&rsquo;m not making it up, it&rsquo;s there. Audience: I know but I meant it might be in an astral body. Adano: No, no, no, no, we have read so many knowledge but we have lost sight of the facts of nature and we&rsquo;re still caught up in all the information. We&rsquo;re trying to point out there are basic scientific laws in this little body that God made that we don&rsquo;t utilize. Audience: There are dozens of Masters who are three, four, five hundred years old, many of them&hellip; would you like to know their names and addresses? I will give them to you after the meeting. Adano: there are what you call deathless Masters that exist, they are Masters who live on. Audience: You mean people talk to Him? Adano: Yes, in fact He has two American disciples who are very advanced, right from America, two advanced American disciples live with Him most of the time and one of them belongs to your TS organization. Audience: Which? Adano: The TS organization. Audience: Well several of us here are part of the Theosophical Society. Adano: One of the American disciples is a member of the TS organization. Audience: I don&rsquo;t even know who you are referring to, do you Myrtle? Adano: Babaji is the Master who has these two American disciples are always with Him, they leave their body and go to Him all the time. Audience: You mean they leave their body in America? Adano: No no, they take the bodies to Him, they have arrived in the stage where they take the body to Him and visit with Him and come back right to America, they don&rsquo;t just lie down in bed and go, they have this ability to leave their place and go the Himalayas and come back by direct transportation, it&rsquo;s called teleportation of the body, they have this ability. Audience: They don&rsquo;t go by place, they go by teleportation. Adano: Right, there are two Americans in this continent here who have arrived at that stage, one is a member of the Theosophical Society. It does exist, they have men who have this ability, the other one is a businessman, but he&rsquo;s retired from business, but he has his estate and he lives in this body, but he goes&hellip; Audience: (inaudible). Adano: Some of these men, especially these two men, they do not have involve themselves with groups, they work at night in their own homes where they live helping people, they materialize themselves at times to different students on the path and reveal themselves to them, this is one of their ways of manifesting to the student. They are working to lift up the spiritual life in this continent, that&rsquo;s their duty, that&rsquo;s why they are being helped by these other Masters. All the Masters have work to do so rest assured when you get a dream of some strange odd incident or something, you&rsquo;re being helped, but you may not be ready to see them for that help. So this is why I say, &ldquo;learning the law of resistance,&rdquo; the law of resistance is responsible for that blockage. Audience: Is there a reason why they keep Their hair long? Audience: That&rsquo;s their antenna. Adano: The funny thing, in a joke you are speaking the truth, actually it is truth. Audience: What is the story of Samson, what does that really illustrate? His strength being in his hair. Am I getting off the subject, I&rsquo;m sorry if I am. Adano: You see if you go back to the age that Samson lived, remember Samson lived in a certain age, he lived in the Taurean age and in his devotion to God by keeping his hair long, he was able to draw in the cosmic energy through the hair into the body. Now that is the mark of the Nazarene because most of the Essene people kept their hair long as a symbol of allowing this cosmic energy to flow in, it flows in from the medulla and the roots of the hair and the tips of the hair and all this is electrically charged. Now when these energies are awakened in the spine, not until that time can a cosmic man do anything, he hasn&rsquo;t got any power, he has to awaken these powers, they&rsquo;re there, but when he moved an object, he wasn&rsquo;t moving it by his physical strength, he was using psychic strength. That&rsquo;s why in the ancient days the Psalms were called Psi-alms, they were psychic aids that they were using, they would chant these things and have these things done. These were tremendous para-psychological control they possessed in their life, they controlled these forces naturally within themselves by concentration and devotion to God. Audience: And he lost it how? Adano: This in the physiological sense of Delilah cutting it off physiologically, the symbol is involved with losing it by &ldquo;grounding the antenna,&rdquo; but in a deeper, esoteric meaning, it involves understanding the principles of regeneration of the body, until we understand how the body is regenerated and this is involved in Love. You see we don&rsquo;t understand that principle because it&rsquo;s not a principle that can be experienced in the physical realm. It&rsquo;s just like Adam and Eve, both of them awakened their life energies which you call the kundalini power in themselves and they stepped out of their frame and saw that they were naked. That doesn&rsquo;t say they were naked because they had no clothes on, they were free from their physical frame and they were in a etheric body for the first time and they saw themselves as cosmic energy but they did not allow the Cosmic Energy to come down from the medulla and open the thousand petal lotus, which is the natural way for it to enter Man and open it, they started working it from the coccyx up. So Man is stuck with this method working from the coccyx up, that was his downfall. Had he remained in this state here and meditated at the point between the eyebrows and let the energy open from here, he would have been in that state and he would not have to step out of his body, he would have taken his body along with him as Jesus showed, the resurrection of the body was the Cosmic Man. You see Man fell by stepping out in the projection and therefore by stepping out he automatically lost his ability to make this body Cosmic Body. Therefore he saw he was naked, he was divested of the power. Instead of keeping his consciousness here and focusing and allowing this Christ Intelligence to work in him to stay up there, he now felt that because the energy was going down in the spine, he had to concentrate on the base of the spine to bring the energy back up. By bringing the energy back up from the spine, he stepped out and in stepping out he saw the mistake but it was too late for him. So Jesus came back to show that &ldquo;when thine eyes are single vision, the body is full of light,&rdquo; if you stay right up here, this power now will come down into you, will take of that body you see. There is no pair, this is no Man, could not life with the idea that he couldn&rsquo;t not die, you see. Audience: You do not teach then starting in the lower centers, to open up the lower centers first. Adano: No, you start right here, if you start at the basal center of your lower spine to develop yourself&hellip; Audience: Is that what they call ole type yoga? Adano: If you keep concentrating on the basal part of the spine, you awaken what is called&hellip; 50 You see the energies are two, you have a positive charge and you have a negative charge, the positive charge stays here all the time so in the Sikh religion, they say &ldquo;we begin here,&rdquo; therefore everybody who talks about yoga beginning from the base of the spine are talking nonsense. So one religious sect can impose something better than the other, they really don&rsquo;t understand anything. So they say &ldquo;ok you stay up here and you go up (inaudible) into Sach Khand, the next seven up there, don&rsquo;t worry about the second seven down here because that is lower. The Yogi of centuries have said in Man, it&rsquo;s only polarities we&rsquo;re talking about, we have a dual polarity in the seven same basic centers, we have a negative polarity which is the downward pull and the positive polarity which is the upward pull so if we say to the person who is coming to study, &ldquo;Ok since you don&rsquo;t know what the positive polarity is, don&rsquo;t concentrate on the seven negative pulls, don&rsquo;t concentrate on the chakras from the downward pull.&rdquo; So don&rsquo;t put your mind on the coccyx, put your mind up here where the seven negative pulls begin, you see what I mean? So as long as you think they&rsquo;re above your head, they will continue to keep your mind up, but actually it only means a flow in the spinal column that energy is positive up and the energy is negative down. Where you center your consciousness down, the energy will move down, when you center your consciousness up, the energy moves up, but it&rsquo;s a flow. Now there is really no up and down in the human body, it&rsquo;s only a point of reference because this is all atomic mass, there&rsquo;s no north, south, and east in the true sense of the word because we are floating in space. If we take you and throw you around in a circle, where&rsquo;s north, south, and east in you, if you&rsquo;re standing on your head, do you see what I mean? It&rsquo;s only a reference point that they have to use to indicate the positive energy and the negative energy. Now the negative energy is what Adam and Even, the original pair, did not understand about and put their consciousness down and therefore they stepped out and saw themselves, they were naked for the first time, they were free for the first time, but in the negative field and all the time they were living in the positive field. They didn&rsquo;t know they were living in the positive charges and they stepped out for the first time and they found themselves in the negative charges. So right away they could not step back in because if they step back in, it was too late. Audience: Well isn&rsquo;t that sort of part of the plan because Man wouldn&rsquo;t have had the free will if he had stayed under the angels. Adano: Right, now you see why the Cosmic Intelligence had to rest and let Man make mistakes by implanting the very first law of resistance or brain jamming. If I say to you, I want you to forget a certain number and the number is 99, you&rsquo;ll go to remember it all the time, do you see what I mean? I demonstrated what is called a brain jamming principle and I&rsquo;ve demonstrated the principal that is gonna make you go against yourself. Now, &ldquo;Thou shalt not eat of the fruit in the midst of the garden.&rdquo; That means thou shalt go that way because only that way can I observe this process of my creation. How else can I see this thing going?&rdquo; If everything is perfect now, there is nothing there for the creative force to work. You see how this cosmological&hellip; The Creator is not damning Man, He is not damning Man or Soul, He has made Soul for a cosmic play, but by setting up what you call the tragedy and setting up the villain first in the process, He has cosmic drama. No villain, no tragedy, no cosmic drama. Audience: No conscious consciousness! Adano: Right! Now you&rsquo;re on the ball, this is exactly what was the process, this is the reason for it all, now you see how you&rsquo;re free from the thing. Audience: Why couldn&rsquo;t He just made it all right to start with? Adano: You realize where you stand, you are Soul. Audience: Only right here, right now. Adano: Here you have to feel it, feel it in the heart. While you meditate here and you start to feel the head like it&rsquo;s head shutting off and the body shutting off and that sensation of fullness, try to direct that fullness to the heart and by directing it to the heart and the heart after a while it is like it is opening up. Audience: And it comes to the head and make it feel full because you&rsquo;re concentrating up here. Adano: Yes it does, you feel&hellip; Audience: I&rsquo;ll tell you what mine does, mind has this pulse. Adano: Right and if you can keep it there and then let it come down to where the heart is, it will stay there and throb and those who can see the light of the Masters in the higher plane, they don&rsquo;t see the light here in them, they see the light here in the heart. Audience: Just how would I go about getting this thought to come on down to my heart. Adano: That&rsquo;s why the SRF teaches you to think of various parts of your body. Now think of your thumb and let your mind rest on your thumb and then think that your mind is on your wrist and think your mind is on your elbow, think of your toes and try to feel your mind in the toes then think of your ankles, this gives you a way to shift your mind to various areas. Now by practicing that, eventually this feeling there will come down and go to the heart because it would learn to move. Ok thank you. Audience: I want to ask you one thing, would you demonstrate those exercises again, I got home and tried to do them and I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;&rsquo;m doing them right. Adano: First you get into a stance like you&rsquo;re going to ski and you just bend the knees slowly. Now the mind should be at the medulla because that&rsquo;s where the energy enters now and you&rsquo;re watching and your mind is here feeling and let the air out. That&rsquo;s the lower breath, low tension, second breath, medium tension, and complete tension is the complete breath. Audience: Complete relaxation with the third one, but you don&rsquo;t relax between these other two. Adano: No you don&rsquo;t relax like that you see, you relax in one shot, you contract in stages. (inaudible) So you&rsquo;re in the same position, now it&rsquo;s counter pressure, the elbows are straight out, and the left palm up (Adano demonstrates breathing). Then I switch over, then I put it behind. The hand is in the back, the palm (Adano demonstrates breathing). Now I switch over to the next hand. Then I sit down, I concentrate this hand goes in, this hand goes out. Now one, one, together, and this is considered like one movement. So I repeat the second movement now.</p>

<p>Adano65_06_03DallasQ1RRNW6 - &hellip;Christ conscious ability to materialize your thoughts at will. There was after Jesus passed away and when they were founding the Church, there was a man and his wife, a very wealthy man who was going to share in the communal living, give a portion of his wealth towards building the community and Peter knowing the very wealthy man was amazed at the money he put in the plate and he looked at him and condemned him for it and the shock killed the man because he was rebuked for his act which he knew he was exposed and when the man fell over dead, Peter realized he had committed an act of pride because the karma came down or the power came down knocked the man. Then the same thing occurred with the wife, she had taken a portion of the money and reinvested it somewhere else and she came back and she heard the news and she was confronted with Peter and she fell down and died. So he too made the one mistake that Jesus was liable to make which is the last test of pride with the ego you see. There is no devil and we say he went up to be tempted in wilderness 40 days and 40 nights fasting, he was hammering out different aspects of ego and the various negatives natures in it, the last one is &ldquo;if you bow down and worship me, all these things are yours.&rdquo; In other words, I give you power over life and death if you only become a dictator over humanity and the scriptures say that Man has the power to have dominion over the universe, but not to possess it, only God possess us and He&rsquo;s hungry, very hungry for us. This is the funny thing, He created us and He&rsquo;s hungry for us, so hungry for our love, nothing else does He want from us because what else would He want from His creation. He cannot ask us for anything else but conscious love from our own efforts, that&rsquo;s why He created us and left us incomplete by the process of evolution physiologically speaking and psychologically endowed us with His cosmic nature to move independently from here to here which is called Cosmic Man, as Jesus says &ldquo;Man ought to be perfect but he is not.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t mean psychologically speaking, psychologically speaking he is imperfect, he has to work out his psychological nature to attain Cosmic Consciousness, perfecting his consciousness, and there is the danger of our conscious. Now understanding the one basic science, Masters from every nation, every group, or every school of thought have all taught the fundamentals of living and the fundamentals of building a psychological temple but we don&rsquo;t practice it because the physiological evolution of the world keeps us entrapped and our attitudes change every second. One moment you&rsquo;re angry with your brother and the next moment the telephone rings and it&rsquo;s your friend, &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve changed from anger to love and you listen very bored and disconcerted, hang up the phone, &ldquo;you can go and drop in the lake&rdquo; and you run to the next person and you hate that one and then you get up and &ldquo;(revving sound)&rdquo; in the car but we are doing that all the time, don&rsquo;t we do it? I&rsquo;m guilty of it, you&rsquo;re guilty, &ldquo;who is without sin, let him cast the first stone&rdquo; so we are all guilty, we can&rsquo;t throw stones at nobody, we are all in the same psychological firmament. We have to realize why we have to build this inner life and where to build it and how to build it, not in the monasteries because they have their period of time and they have served their time and in the home today we can do it. We must go back to the various information left to us by the Sages, that is environment in order to acquire the attitude, so if we look at the Church, the Church is an environment, you go there with respect to the Church, nine times out of ten we don&rsquo;t go there with the respect because God is being spoken in that building, you see. If we went there with the fact that God is being spoken in that building or that we go there to have some contact with God Consciousness, this would be a different attitude to the Church even, I guess the priests would be pretty shook up to see people coming in with a reverent attitude and they&rsquo;d sit down and they don&rsquo;t want to hear all that talk, they just want to hear good organ music and really have silent communion with the Spirit. He might get pretty shook up, he may take off into some other realm, scared of his own congregation, for the first time we have devotees of God, but we create this environment for ourselves with love and it&rsquo;s in the heart, aching for completion. We are all aching for completion, but completion of what, is it the completion of knowledge in total or is it the peace that passes all understanding that allow us to have the ability to execute knowledge at will. We cannot carry the ocean of consciousness or a total knowledge in ourselves because we are a living organism and Masters have this thing coming into them, realized men have it passing through them. They don&rsquo;t say one moment their consciousness is here or there, they don&rsquo;t tie it up, but they have peace all the time. That&rsquo;s why Jesus is a good example for Westerners who are acquainted with His mission and life, &ldquo;The peace I give is not the world give,&rdquo; He don&rsquo;t give that type of peace, the world gives you another kind of peace, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t argue, we don&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; this is the world&rsquo;s type of peace, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be friends.&rdquo; So every time you&rsquo;re leery if he is really friendly with you, we negotiate for peace. We&rsquo;re doubtful though, any moment we&rsquo;re liable to &ldquo;Yeeeaah sure&rdquo; claws at each other or find out that he ain&rsquo;t no friend, see what I mean, the peace is not there. Why? Because too many pressures, too many desires involved. Now when the peace comes from within yourself, with all your materials pressures, all your material desires and possessions, which can be umpteenth big, and you can get this peace that cuts out these internal tensions like that, you have found your Christ in yourself, you have come back home to the Divine. This peace is in us, right in us, it&rsquo;s nowhere else, nowhere else can you find it. Now Shakespeare goes another way by saying &ldquo;happiness is nowhere to be found, but in a contented mind.&rdquo; Well let&rsquo;s look at this statement and see if it&rsquo;s really the contented mind and not the contents of the mind. If we say happiness is nowhere to be found but in the contents of the mind, what you have in the mind will bring you peace, will bring you happiness, but if you don&rsquo;t have anything there that is worthwhile looking at then there are only what I call psychological antiques or physiological antiques, old verbal ideas or images, fears, and so forth, you have an unhappy mind, unhappy mind is restless, there is no peace, there is no love, but if your ideas, your concepts, your attitudes all in here are the type that brings you joy, the type of memories that you can recall and as they say in the song, &ldquo;count your blessing.&rdquo; Here inside here personal experiences you look in and see the percentages of those that are unhappy and those that are happy, contents, then we can have something to build on. So we must realize that peace is in us and God is aching for our love so that this peace can flow, He&rsquo;s aching for us since He is the life energy and He has become us, He&rsquo;s aching in every muscle, in every cell to withdraw from the external realm. 0:10 Now the external realm is involved with emotions, that means motion, e-moting, every form of energy going out, everything you do is to put the energy from within your mechanism outwards to express it outward more and more until it becomes obsessed and they say you are a very emotional, unstable individual, you&rsquo;re liable to get upset very fast, but it is only because you are probed and pulled outwards. So if we understand emotion pulling us outwards where are we going to find God which is supposed to be inwards as Jesus says or any one of these great Masters that lived on this Earth plane, they say inside. Now the opposite of emotion is devotion, that is a conscious withdrawal from the five senses: seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, and touch from this world of matter back into this (inaudible) of consciousness and joy, which is spirit, peace, serenity, these are four words that we intellectually understand, but we don&rsquo;t experience in our mechanism, when we can experience joy, serenity, peace, we&rsquo;ll also experience bliss or ecstasy which gives us wisdom, but until we experience it in terms of the physical nature, it&rsquo;s only a mental concept. Audience: May I ask there when you say bliss and peace has to be experienced more than just mentally? Adano: Yes, you have to experience this condition. To describe is like, you&rsquo;re tired and you go to sleep and you wake up and when you wake up you feel refreshed and the body seems to have gone through a change. That is something you have physically felt and can relate it and recall it back to your physical senses and objective world. Now while you were asleep you did not know if you&rsquo;re a man or a woman and right away you are in doubt as to the experience, but all you can say is &ldquo;I had a pretty good sleep last night,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re rested now. Now let&rsquo;s see in the sleep were you restless or were you peaceful, you have no way to check that unless somebody&rsquo;s observing you under the condition, but if it was peaceful and peaceful sleep doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you don&rsquo;t twist and toss on the bed, you can twist and toss a million times on the bed in eight hours and still have peaceful rest, you understand, or don&rsquo;t move on the bed and still have a restless rest you see, because the conditions are varying inside of you, you don&rsquo;t realize it. Now when you can recognize peace as an actual feeling of recharging the body, an actual cooling down of the senses, an actual settling of the mind, an actual opening up and being aware of the colors in the room brighter, objects become sharper in their shape and form, sounds become clearer, and you feel bubbling joy coming up, you know you this buoyant feeling. Now the more you get into the spiritual life, this condition begins to flow through you, you begin to regenerate your body, you do not degenerate no more, your body will gradually exhibit higher and higher degrees of buoyancy, health, and awareness, and this is the physical expression of the psychological temple. Audience: There&rsquo;s somebody else I wish could&rsquo;ve heard that because that&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve been wondering exactly if the meditation is going as it should, wouldn&rsquo;t health and buoyancy and energy be the outcropping of it? Adano: Yes, because &ldquo;you shall know them by their works, by their fruits shall you know them&rdquo; and that doesn&rsquo;t mean all who walk with a cross in their hand shouting &ldquo;Lord, Lord, Lord.&rdquo; As a fellow once said to me, he said &ldquo;Adano how can you side with these vegetarians who open all these health shops, they look sicker than the people who eat meat.&rdquo; I says give them time, give them time, they are working at the level and they&rsquo;re cleaning themselves up, the time will come when they outshine you when your body tapers off at a certain age, starts breaking down and there is no way for the tissues to build back, theirs will build. Audience: Most of them are half dead before they got into it. Adano: Quite true and this is what we have to realize, they have actually come into a higher concept of living to build their psychological nature up and their spiritual temple and therefore they are doing labor work now, they are laying the foundation, you cannot assess the building by looking at the foundation. As Sonny my friend an artist, he was painting a picture once and I look at it and says &ldquo;well it doesn&rsquo;t look like that, in my mind I didn&rsquo;t see it like that, it&rsquo;s a little shade darker.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Shut up, you&rsquo;re looking at a half finished job. In your mind you see it perfect, this is half finished, I&rsquo;m working with my hands.&rdquo; So I realize the same thing is happening to these people&hellip; Audience: It&rsquo;s a half finished job. Adano: It&rsquo;s a half finished job, they&rsquo;re not finished so you cannot condemn them when in time this health, this peace, this serenity, and this inner conviction that the joy you feel in your body is God-contact. It is there, give yourself time to get this conviction established in yourself and don&rsquo;t be afraid that it&rsquo;s taking time because you&rsquo;ve stayed away so long from your Creator, our beloved Father, what do you expect? He&rsquo;s going to overnight we&rsquo;re going to just wake up all realized individuals? We are making an effort to build a temple that &ldquo;He could dwell in the midst therefore.&rdquo; &ldquo;Build Me a temple that I may dwell in the midst thereof.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the life consciousness, the life power, God, so life brings more health, life brings consciousness or expanded consciousness, and it brings joy. Now in terms of material abundance, yes, it is there, &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; Life more abundantly, we&rsquo;re not going to find that the spiritual man after he starts building his spiritual temple in terms of himself are any less off, all things flow to him then by the law of Divine magnetism. Audience: It&rsquo;s sort of a magnetizing of his nature in a sense so that things of a like nature are attracted or something like that? Adano: Yes it is a fact because it&rsquo;s based on the law of attraction and if you&hellip; why the Sages emphasize right thinking, right attitude is because wrong thinking, wrong attitudes tear down the mechanism and you have more unhealthy people around you as a result of wrong thinking, wrong acting, wrong living. Now more unhealthy people you have, the atmosphere becomes polluted with psychic waves, every wrong thought is already there, it&rsquo;s like looking at a whole nest of overexposed negatives, they&rsquo;re no good to no one, they&rsquo;re all there and you&rsquo;re cluttering around the cosmos with your wrong thinking and it&rsquo;s cluttering up&hellip; half finished thinking, they&rsquo;re all half-finished and over exposed, there&rsquo;s no value, imagine that a person walks in the room and the room is very tense. You&rsquo;ve been to places where you walk in and the room is tense from the way people think and you can sense it, if you&rsquo;re able to see it they&rsquo;re like half-finished, over exposed negatives. Now you walk in the room and the vibrations are pleasant, you sense it and if you can see it you will see the complete thought form, they are there. Now the Churches have been impregnated already with an attitude (inaudible) repetition, but if the individual go to the Church with the fact that there is more than just what he&rsquo;s getting, then that Church will vibrate more, healings will occur in that Church. 0:20 Now if he comes to his own home and has the same reverence and attitude, then greater things begin to occur in his life, &ldquo;life more abundantly.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s here, now, not tomorrow and we&rsquo;re the only people I think in the outside realm that pray and hope it happens. When I&rsquo;ve been among the Indians on reservation and when they pray, they start a prayer meeting about eight o&rsquo;clock at night and it finishes eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning so they really pray, but in every one of their prayer till dawn and though they may ask for healing for someone, it is always &ldquo;now, Lord Jesus, now.&rdquo; Not tomorrow, they want to see it now and it&rsquo;s amazing, before dawn comes around, that individual who they are praying for usually gets up from his sick bed and walk out, the vibrations and attitude are there established. Audience: Is it a lasting thing too? Adano: It is a lasting thing and doctors are amazed that the prayer healing done on these reservations do manifest, though there are many cases where the individual may have an operation, but they still pray for that person that the doctor will be the right doctor to perform and that person will pull through that operation. It&rsquo;s a rare case that you hear that (inaudible) and they pray, but in our own churches we just go and pray and that&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s finished, these people are living Christianity, they are trying to experience in terms of themselves, not just mentally alone, they want to experience this peace, they want to experience joy, they may not have much in terms of physical wealth because they live in a very barren country, but for what they do have, they seem to enjoy it. Now as this civilization gets into their areas, they have the same complications as modern man has when he starts to step out from his agricultural background into an industrial environment, to buy a car or a truck, it means they have to find jobs to maintain themselves. So they have to go without, people in this environment still go without for many things for their children, we do these things, it&rsquo;s natural, but our churches don&rsquo;t help us through the periods where we have dry spells in our lives in our daily problems. We can&rsquo;t go to church and say &ldquo;Ok reverend would you pray for us through this dry spell of consciousness or this particular period when we&rsquo;re having it rough,&rdquo; we have nowhere to turn, but when these people on the reservation, they go their little native church and they hold a prayer meeting for the person who is having a difficult time, they find out he&rsquo;s having a difficult time, he asks for a prayer meeting and they pray to get his through that difficult time. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t get the financial resources coming, in a strange way he gains the strength and the courage to stick it out, he doesn&rsquo;t crack up, we crack up and we&rsquo;ve got it better off than they, where we can turn for many sources of help that will prevent this cracking up, they don&rsquo;t have any to turn to, yet they only have this simple faith, simple confidence in the peace they feel in their prayer or their meditation. Audience: You know the amazing thing is there is some countries that I&rsquo;ve always admired so much and that&rsquo;s been Norway and Sweden and Denmark and I think there are no three countries over in Europe who have conquered slums and poverty or anything to the extent they have, almost there&rsquo;s not such a thing known as slum areas so I understand in Norway and Sweden and yet their suicide rate is higher than anyplace else in the world and their juvenile delinquency is extremely high. Adano: Very true. Audience: And their family units are breaking up. Audience: Yes, but as far as abundance, I mean abundance in the material way, they are definitely taken care of. Audience: Their initiative has been removed. Adano: Interest, see they have attitude already, but if they have no interest, how can they render service? Audience: And then there&rsquo;s no one to render service to because their taxes are taken and the service is given so they have a useless existence. Audience: That&rsquo;s what the government has done for the Negro people up north by feeding them generation after generation, they&rsquo;ve destroyed their motivation, they have none, yet in Harlem every morning they say is littered completely. These are people who are supposed to be starving and yet the streets are littered with beer cans every morning, just solid. Audience: Well that isn&rsquo;t the solution but more if more people had the attitude Adano is trying to help us get, then we wouldn&rsquo;t need the welfare state. Adano: Right, it is really a regression in man&rsquo;s thinking to let go of his initiatives, he&rsquo;s regressing, he&rsquo;s remaining in self-centeredness, the Rajasic consciousness, what we call the Rajasic consciousness, he remains in self-centeredness and no longer think in terms of moving out to the next level of development, the next man. Let&rsquo;s rest for awhile with the talk and we do a little meditation and we&rsquo;ll come back to some more talk because meditation is what feeds the Soul and talk can only feed the mind. (Gap in tape) &hellip; in our consciousness if we really go deep in the Spirit and it&rsquo;s there, everything that is being said, we&rsquo;ve all lived it in some form or another and the last statement is true when the realization comes to you, &ldquo;I and My Father are one and you and I are one,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re all one with the cosmos, we are Soul, we&rsquo;re not bodies, we&rsquo;re not minds, we&rsquo;re Soul. We possess the body and work through it, but if we understand we are Soul and understand our oneness with God and life, we are free, now free, free from the repercussions of our thinking, that is what salvation really is because &ldquo;as you sow that you reap&rdquo; and what are we gonna need to be free from, &ldquo;as a man think in his heart that is what he is,&rdquo; there must be something wrong in his thinking to make him suffer. So if we realize that we are Soul and this is what the scriptures point out, &ldquo;Come let us make Man in our own image and likeness,&rdquo; image is the atomic structure, likeness is the cosmic nature, cosmic intelligence, or cosmic attitude, &ldquo;male and female create ye them and He breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul,&rdquo; not a living body or a living mind, Soul, big difference than mind or body or spirit because God is the Oversoul or cosmic self, He has become us. Now when we realize that daily by merging in meditation and looking at the light that we see in the consciousness, &ldquo;the light shines the darkness, but the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; We have a brain that is working away inside, radiating cosmic light, we can turn-in as Jesus says, &ldquo;when the eyes are single visioned, the body is full of light,&rdquo; we can see that inner light, feel its presence and know THAT has become us. In other words, we are all a manifestation of a Divine Atom you see, we&rsquo;re living in the atomic age, we&rsquo;ve experienced atomic knowledge, but we don&rsquo;t have reverence for its true Being and it being in us or becoming us. Until we understand these functions properly and return back to that source, it is not possible for us to be free from the repercussions of our thinking and that is why we reap what we sow, that is where the law of cause and effect comes into our lives, we call it karma, but this is based on thinking attitude. 0:30 Until we establish proper attitude or the Beatitudes, Sermon on the Mount, or any one of the great Sages, the attitude of love basically&hellip; I heard a lecture Sunday about the prodigal son and his father and they made more of an issue of the clothes and the food they were going to give the son than the love that was exchanged between the father and the son and this is what has been lost sight in the whole story. They made an issue of the boy living in one country and wasting his heritage and living on slop. We&rsquo;re in the Soul&rsquo;s return to itself, we&rsquo;re not interested how long or how crusty that Soul has lived in ignorance, we&rsquo;re interested in the fact it got back there and it was recognized, it was reinforced, reinstated in its true nature. The moment we get away from the fact that we are bodies or we are minds, we posses souls, we&rsquo;ll keep on living with the repercussions of our thinking, we will still suffer from it until we stop that type of thinking and realize that we are Soul from the word go, then we realize we have laid the foundation for love. We have to live love, love is a very difficult thing to live because it demands the utmost of our consciousness and it demands a tremendous inner honest with ourselves and very few of us are willing to be self-honest and this is only natural because we have to conform to the various environments that have forced us into the mold. Audience: Do you think we always are even aware that we are dishonest, it&rsquo;s a very subtle sort of thing. I think often we&rsquo;re dishonest without knowing it. Adano: Yes we are dishonest without knowing it because we are ignoring, we are living in a state of ignoring, ignorance, to ignore what we are. You see the Sage once said, &ldquo;God, Spirit, Mind, Love, and Tranquility,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;these are words, but these words have half meanings to some people, they will have real meaning, they don&rsquo;t have real experience to some people, yet to those who have experience in terms these words really represent and can produce what it do represent in terms of the physical nature, then we have lived it.&rdquo; So Master Yogananda used to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in people who talk of the Bible, I&rsquo;m interested in the man who can live one sentence of the Bible.&rdquo; If his whole life was representing one sentence in the Bible, that man is living the Bible, that man is experiencing the Bible. If he never knew anything else and didn&rsquo;t do anything else in terms of spiritual culture, if he would only live one sentence and make this one sentence his guiding light of inner life, that man is a living Bible unto himself. He says the rest are going to flow automatically to him, the knowledge is going to flow because he will pull it, that man is natural with that consciousness and this is the basis of the inner peace. Now in the meditation you find that you are in the state of peace, that is you&rsquo;re not agitated, you&rsquo;re not getting restless, we have thoughts that come and go, but we&rsquo;re not worrying about the thoughts coming and going, they will settle down of their own nature, don&rsquo;t try to interfere with them because then you are taking your conscious will to move something that the mind has to do. All you have to realize is like a bronco rider, that&rsquo;s the Soul, who gets on the bronco bucking horse and hooks himself into it and lets the horse run itself until it gets tired and stop and that&rsquo;s your mind. That horse is gonna buck and buck and buck till it gets tired and says &ldquo;well I&rsquo;ve exhausted every verbal concept, I know what I am&rdquo; and then it reach the last thing and don&rsquo;t know any more ideas coming, then then Soul will shine through like a light, POW, right in this dark skull of ours we&rsquo;ll see a flash of light and light we know is white, but white light is colors when it breaks itself, it breaks into colors, so we will see colors, not necessarily the pow of the white light but when that happens, it is there and it breaks into colors. There are several colors in the consciousness, we are only interested in the three higher aspects of the light and that is the gold radiance like a circle of radiant light and inner part of the gold light is blue or opal blue or purple and in this inner blue light it flips like a five pointed star, but coming down it looks like a dove descending. So when John initiated Jesus and Jesus saw the opening of the higher Christ center in Himself, He heard within His inner consciousness, this descent of light is the beloved Sun, SUN, in which the cosmic is well pleased to manifest. When an individual recognizes his true heritage, his true kingdom or true nature, it is a pleasure for this consciousness to flow for the first time in a given brain that can recognize it. If you feel that peace, it comes and cuts out your problems like that and you reconcile to nature, you have found it too. Light, peace, joy, these three words have more meaning in terms of actual experience and of a permanent nature, that you can hold onto this thing day and night and it removed unconsciousness after a while, that there is no more unconsciousness as you experience when you go to sleep and do not know what you are. Now isn&rsquo;t this what makes us afraid of ourselves, that we don&rsquo;t know what we are when we are asleep and we don&rsquo;t know what we will be when we pass out of the frame when we die. So the fear of the unconscious is the real fear that we call death. Now when we realize this condition existing in ourselves and we look in as Jesus tells us to look in and if we are patient with it, it&rsquo;ll open up even if we gotta say &ldquo;Father I love You, Father I love You&rdquo; or &ldquo;Beloved Jesus,&rdquo; whatever Saint or Sage, communion of the Saints, these are all possible ways to make this consciousness open and as much as we cry in our little corner in our homes, we don&rsquo;t have to make a show in the public, in our own homes, our own inner temple, &ldquo;when thou prayest retreat in the inner temple,&rdquo; pray wanting it now, wanting this realize that you are Soul, wanting this constant peace, this constant joy that fills you beyond all understanding, that you can now walk out and face this hostile environment and not be of it and yet be in it, a freed Soul, free while living, free what you call salvation, the Orientals call illumination, light or enlightenment, at last you have found the liberation. Then you know that you are free from the repercussions of your thinking, from that moment all your attitude is gonna be love and strange as it seem, life abundant begins to flow, people say you are so lucky if you fall in mud and come up smelling like honey, you see. Now this takes care of all the inner problems, any questions. 0:40 Audience: I was just thinking of something you just said, it just dawned on me to begin thinking in those terms, but as long as you want something, it indicates in your consciousness that you&rsquo;re separated from it. Adano: Yes. Audience: But if you affirm that you are that thing, it&rsquo;s only making it true in your consciousness what actually is. Adano: Yes, you see when we pray and Jesus said, &ldquo;the Gentiles pray for food and clothing and so forth,&rdquo; Gentiles do not mean the non-Jew you see and the Jew did not mean an Israelite, though we call the country Israel today, that has nothing to do with spiritual knowledge or the spiritual law. God is reality, He is the Is-ness of all things manifest and unmanifest and to be a child of God is to return back to reality in yourself. If you stay outside, you are like a lost sheep, &ldquo;go unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,&rdquo; go unto those individuals who have strayed, kept their consciousness away from reality in themselves and are locked up in this environment. Don&rsquo;t go un-gentile, those who act like lambs, wear lambs clothing, and are wolves in disguise because they wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference either, you see what I mean, they have that problem. Now it isn&rsquo;t that the people who are engrossed in their five senses living like lambs and are wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing are not worthy for redemption, but until they have had enough of the problems of nature working on their mechanism, they are not going to be interested in the reality of themselves. Now those who&rsquo;ve had some glimpse of reality in themselves and can&rsquo;t stick with it, those are the ones are lost because they have deviated from that light, they have seen the light but did not have confidence in the light, could not realize that this thing is a slow process of patience and faith and inner realization, they deviate and went back out to the five senses, things that are more tangible now, they went back to the rituals, they went back to the ceremonies, they&rsquo;re afraid of themselves where they are. Now when we look in ourselves we see that this is going on all the time and that is why we must go back to our inner self. Audience: And know it&rsquo;s the Divine Nature. Adano: It is the Divine Nature and that is why we must meditate to verify these things. Audience: It may take you awhile. Adano: Yeah, does that clarify mental blocks or pull out some of the rocks from some of the ruts? Now your mind can move forward to the next level? Any questions? Audience: You know Yogananda, Helen loaned me one of her 1929 magazines and I was telling Paul tonight one of the things that was interesting, we heard so much of helping humanity and we&rsquo;ve also heard so much about selfishness being wrong, but he was pointing out in this how the helping of humanity and now as we rise higher in consciousness and in understanding, all we actually do is rise higher in the type of selfishness that we have. He said he had quite an argument with a man one time about that, because he said if you were not trying to please God and knew at the same time you were helping yourself by doing that which you knew was right, you wouldn&rsquo;t be helping humanity and it&rsquo;s only because your desire to help humanity is really a desire to help yourself only at a higher level which I thought was very interesting, I never thought of divine selfishness, that is about what it amounts to. Adano: That is why He whipped the people out of the temple and got them out and that was the real reason too. Now we live in a state of indifference all the time and this state is called by the sages, tamasic / inertia,  it is a state that is dragging, we cannot live in that state all the time, of indifference, sooner or later something will move us from indifference forward into activity and that is called rajasic, but that activity is based on self-centeredness, it&rsquo;s not going anyplace but within its own orbit of activity, it&rsquo;s self-centered, so self-centered that it becomes the biggest ego in the universe, everything is revolving around this self-centeredness. When the air is let out of the balloon of self-centeredness, it collapses mental wreck, individual is scared of existence now because he didn&rsquo;t build anything from within. The next outlet for him is sattvic or actions necessary to life, any action that is necessary for the benefit of life would be a pure act, an act based on desireless-ness. Audience: Service. Adano: Right, service, so we see interest, attitude, and service are the foundations and the walls of this psychological, spiritual temple. We must build this, if you don&rsquo;t build these properly into the mechanism, this higher self can&rsquo;t work. You can&rsquo;t put up this building without setting up the basement, the foundation, even those who build houses build the roof first, still got to build it through the cement and put up the uprights for that roof to come on top. We can build a roof but it&rsquo;s helpless by itself, that is we can build para-psychology and we can build meditation or we can build astro-psychology, but we don&rsquo;t have the thing to put it on anything, you see what I mean? Audience: Is there such a thing as thinking on these things only long enough for them to be incorporated? Well what I mean is when you start riding a bicycle, you consciously know which way you turn the handlebars in order to stay upright, but after awhile, after you&rsquo;ve ridden a month or two, it&rsquo;s sort of an automatic thing. Is it possible that you can dwell on these only so long&hellip; I mean that you can dwell on them so that the first thing you know they&rsquo;re sort of automatic and then you grow as (inaudible). Adano: Yes, that is what is going on in us. Audience: That&rsquo;s the durable result, then you don&rsquo;t need the props like the directions for taking specific exercises when you understand the basics of it and you do them by shortcut, you might say automatically. Adano: Yes, it is there and to reinforce that condition, meditation is important. Now for those who don&rsquo;t understand what meditation really is, the word is an anagram. For centuries meditation meant going like that and sitting and vegetating you know, starry eyed individuals you see statues of them sitting down and they think that&rsquo;s meditation. They&rsquo;re not supposed to be doing anything, these crazy oriental people, just waste away their time sitting in some cave or mountaintop, but the word is an anagram and orientals never wrote this way, they always wrote this way, and until we understand what they were doing we&rsquo;re going to see the word and books on it, but it&rsquo;s not bringing us closer to ourselves, to understand what is done and how it is applied. We have anagrams or we have abbreviated words made up in English, UNICEF and UNIVAC and all these things, these are words made up, LASER beam, MASER, these are all words made up of the initial letters. In years to come we wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference either, we would just use the term and that&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s stuck with us. Meditation is MEDITATION, the first M represents Mental, E represents Energy, because it&rsquo;s mental energy you&rsquo;re working with all the time. D represents Direction, I represents Individual so it&rsquo;s a personal practice, no two people can do the same thing, they can group together and practice group meditation, but you&rsquo;re experiences and my experiences are gonna differ at the moment and our observations, but the common peace is present, the common understanding is there. Now individual it&rsquo;s T stands for Thought, individual thought, A Activities, the activities of thought that you&rsquo;re observing, T Towards, I Intuitive, not sensory, intuitive, O Observation and Oneness, this is a dual function, first you observe intuitive and then you become one, N Nature Noumena, not phenomena. 0:50 So we see meditation is Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities Toward an Intuitive Observation and Oneness of the Noumena, God. Now we see we have science, philosophy, and religion all in one process. Now the scientist has to use his five senses plus extensions of those five senses to observe nature or the noumena / phenomena so we have x-rays, fluoroscopes, radar, tv, I mean microscopes and televisions, things to extend the five senses. The mystic or the realized man has his intuitive self, now intuition don&rsquo;t mean a hunch in the term that we use the term, it means knowing from within directly independent of the senses and so directly that there is no mistake and it has to be awakened by meditation by a light process, &ldquo;when thine eyes are single vision, the body is full of light.&rdquo; We see directly into the structure of nature, God, the very noumena holding up the universe and we become one with Him by merging in Him and accepting our responsibility of having become us. We then realize that we have to revere Him, we have to revere everything now, no matter if it looks like that machine, there is a respect for it. So in treating the consciousness and in rendering healing light, Man first heals himself by being receptive and &ldquo;as many as received to them gave ye the powers to become Suns of God.&rdquo; Sun S-U-N not son, suns of light, God is light and little suns of light in the brain emanating this light, as many as can see this light, it comes in. Now as it comes in, as I said before it has three colors, the light breaks up into gold, blue, and white, like a five pointed star descending down it looks like a dove. The five points represent ether, earth, air, and water, fire, the primordial functions of nature. It descends into us and from the point between the eyebrow it descends into the heart and the meditation is to go in and feel this thing rising in us and merging with the peace all the time and accepting the consciousness. Now as we go in and we understand that God has become us, now we can treat, first we treat each one in the room by receiving this consciousness in this light, in this feeling of joy or peace, and it anoints us, which we call grace, the flood of light into the body and then you feel it emanating, enveloping everyone in the room and seeing them whole in body, mind, and spirit. Then the entire building because the walls represent the Creative Force too. &ldquo;If the tongues of men of peace were cut out, the stones would shout peace.&rdquo; So that is part of the nature, an inanimate object, you have to send out that healing vibration from your consciousness out to satisfy, pacify all these things and see them go back into their normal frequency. So you treat out the entire mineral kingdom, that includes all the galaxies, the entire vegetable kingdom, the entire animal kingdom, the entire human kingdom, and the entire spiritual kingdom. One person says &ldquo;why you have to heal the spiritual kingdom?&rdquo; I said they need it more than we because they need us to pray so that they can work for us. The higher beings can only work if we are in tune with them, they cannot interfere. It&rsquo;s like the radio waves in this room are flowing but it cannot interfere if you don&rsquo;t want to turn on the radio or the TV, who is going to make it work. So you see our little 25% activity brings the rest in see and then we radiate it back into the cosmic self, God, centering into the heart, it has to come back to your heart because the pure in heart sees God, not the pure in mind. There is a light that flows in the heart that shuts the heart off and allow you to be free from this shell and realize that you are Soul, you are Soul, having like many clothes you are a human being wearing suits, you shed them off one at a time, but you know this and you go into yourself and you meditate. Now this may be far ahead from what you&rsquo;ve read or maybe not that much in comparison to what you&rsquo;ve read, it may be very simple, don&rsquo;t look at its simplicity or don&rsquo;t look at it as being complicated or far fetched, it is within our own mechanism, we have to understand it and have confidence in it and it don&rsquo;t require any strange practice to pray to God, even Jesus made it very simple, &ldquo;look inside, it&rsquo;s here, nowhere else and feel it here.&rdquo; We can&rsquo;t go anyplace outside this mechanism that is going to work, we don&rsquo;t know of any other place, you can&rsquo;t feel it here and you can&rsquo;t see it here, you see what I mean, it has to be centered. Well I talk too much (laughter). Audience: No you don&rsquo;t, you haven&rsquo;t said the same thing since you&rsquo;ve been here. Audience: Adano, I think I read it once, she had read somewhere and I probably should not even mention it, but this light that goes through the heart, is there such a thing as the perfect image of Man in the center of the heart? Is there a place there where the perfect image of you, your Soul? Is there such a thing as that? I&rsquo;m not putting it very well, if you connect up with that is there something there to connect up with. Adano: You see the pure in heart sees God, that is you see your higher self. Remember you&rsquo;re not going to see somebody sitting on a throne and waiting with long beard and a pickaxe or something or an hourglass, ringing a bell waiting for you to recognize, &ldquo;Here me, I&rsquo;m God, waiting for you, I&rsquo;m so glad you evolved over these billions of years to recognize I was waiting for you.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re not going to see anything like that, you will find your higher self. Now your higher self is your Christ-self and you are linked to it. Audience: Is it a&hellip; should I said is it a form? I don&rsquo;t mean that old man with a beard. Adano: You see it has to do with an aspect of consciousness, the highest aspect of consciousness Man wants of his God to materialize for him or congeal for him is form of human shape, this is something that is affinity in his being. A cow would like to have a bigger cow to represent God for him, a lion would like a bigger lion, the fact is the futility of the mechanism makes us fear the cosmos and its immensity so we have to imprison it in form to have relationship, do you follow me there Paul? This is our problem, this little mechanism feels so futile with its limitations but when it reaches out and sees the immensity of its being that it is consciousness, then form loses its meaning. Now you see Jesus, you will see all the Masters in form, crystallized as pillars in the Father&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time and I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; 1:00 That is the man who has reached realization and is freed from the repercussions of his thinking, he has overcome and will not repeat it a second time, that is reincarnation, will become a pillar in the house of the Lord, he will resurrect, permanent in the cosmos rendering loving service to undeveloped beings, you will see them there and they will greet you as an elder brother, an elder sister, and you&rsquo;re coming into their brotherhood of light, the brotherhood of eternal consciousness, and the Father aspect will manifest as Jesus, the mother aspect will manifest as any other Saint who loved the mother aspect&hellip; Audience: It won&rsquo;t necessarily be Jesus though would it? Adano: No, any great Saint who looked to God in the aspect he want, the devotee will find him as that and if you don&rsquo;t want no form you will see Him as the Cosmic Light, the Germinal Light, the white clear Germinal Light responsible for manifestation, existing in the black light which you call darkness. It is both light, one of the white germinal nature and one of the soil in which it works, the black light. So we say we plant seed into black earth, it sprouts forth, it always splits in two, you say the germinal light living in the dark light of consciousness sprout forth as a dual being, Father / Mother aspect God. Audience: It doesn&rsquo;t have any density does it, the dark or light? Adano: It&rsquo;s density and it&rsquo;s our relationship to it, but you will see your higher self and what is your higher self, you will see another you, far more refined, devoid of all the densities of limitations of the you that you look at now, that&rsquo;s all, and you will know that you are a Son of God, you are a Child of God, you are a higher self, freed&hellip; Audience: I like to think about this concepts of God or the concept of anything for that matter, is being a temporary platform, you reach up to it and crawl on it and it may take you twenty years or two years, it doesn&rsquo;t make any different, but when you get there then you see your horizons farther away, the vision or the concept changes until gradually you crawl on a new platform, but all these platforms are tremendously important and helpful in your evolutions. I know as Adano said &ldquo;when I was a very small child I thought of God as this old man with a long white beard,&rdquo; but that concept served me very well. I was amazed in reading, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve read the Mahatma letters where the Masters say, &ldquo;You speak of God, we know of no such being.&rdquo; And these are Masters speaking. So you see all our concepts have to change&hellip; Adano: Now Yogananda wanted to enter that state of consciousness so he went to meet his teacher and his teacher touched him on the heart, the heart stopped and the life energy oozed out through the entire cellular system and he saw the entire cosmos, cosmos and cosmos, beings and beings, every level that you can see it went there and when he came back into his physical frame, he was still doubtful that he saw God. So he came to his Master one day, he says &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found God, I&rsquo;ve been with you so long, I haven&rsquo;t found God.&rdquo; So his Guru says, &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re looking for somebody sitting on a throne, saying He&rsquo;s God, or you&rsquo;re thinking that the possession of miraculous powers when you get into that state makes you found God.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;A man can have all these things and still find that he doesn&rsquo;t have the realization.&rdquo; Because Jesus says &ldquo;What it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his Soul?&rdquo; Not recognizing his higher self and his higher self lives in levels of activity of service which is infinite, world without end. Where are you going to render service, only on this little Earth planet? With our little understanding that with a few little telescopes that there&rsquo;s nobody out on the other side, we&rsquo;re so pompous in our activity, &ldquo;boy we are wonderful human beings&rdquo; to think in this whole galaxy, you look at night you see millions upon millions of stars and here we are, a few little worms walking around, we are the supreme? Audience: Well you only have to get up in an airplane to begin to realize your absolutely nothingness. I had that amazing trip, of course I don&rsquo;t ride often in airplanes, I just ride once in a great while, so each time I go it&rsquo;s a new experience and I had the most amazing feeling up there looking down, it gives you such a different perspective and for once you feel your insignificance and the fact that nothing is important unless you play your part in the anthill like any normal ant should you know. Adano: I&rsquo;ll tell you something Marilyn, every night you go to bed and you wake up, the way you felt yesterday when you went to sleep and the way you feel today is different, yesterday is a memory to you, right now this Marilyn is entirely different. When you go to bed tonight and tomorrow you wake up, you gonna feel different, so if you understand this principle, sleep is an illustration at a lower level of levels upon levels of consciousness, being, how you feel, how your attitude would be, this is your self going on, living and dying daily as St. Paul says, that is the same thing. Now that is deeper physiological actions that you can live and die daily in the Lord, there is no end because every time you come out of that state, you are evolved up that level of consciousness. Now we came here tonight at a certain level, with a certain feeling, with a certain attitude, we&rsquo;re not the same people right at this moment. We have gone through so many levels of our own consciousness and our mechanisms have made so many changes, we will not notice this until we assess ourselves by tomorrow, what we have done tonight, do you see, and what is happening we are only assessing this in 24 hours, let us assess this in terms of one lifespan or one body form, can you see what is happened, how many body forms you might have been exposed to to have this same consciousness and now moving on to higher body forms for higher consciousness, don&rsquo;t you see how Divine Justice is all worked out with tremendous unending opportunities for growth? No end to this process, that&rsquo;s why &ldquo;to him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time,&rdquo; that is repeat the same old pattern, &ldquo;but make him a pillar in the house of the Lord.&rdquo; He will be rendering loving service. You will see a higher Marilyn, far more of all the qualities of the higher self that are lacking in the lower self. Walt Whitman says &ldquo;When I saw my higher self&rdquo; he realized he could not let his higher self be debased by the lower self no more so he too had to realize that once the higher self recognize the lower self and the lower self recognize the higher self, one has to act out this role, he&rsquo;s in the body, they have to live in the body, the higher self is still going to be a silent witness. Audience: Yeah but as that silent self begins to be more and more in your consciousness, your lower body becomes lighter and lighter, I don&rsquo;t even know how to explain it but it becomes less dense so to speak, less heavy or something. Adano: Right, ok. Audience: Well let me ask you a question there Adano if I&rsquo;m following this right. The churches are against any checking or experimentation beyond certain points, but some of the scientific doctors have gone to extremes which I won&rsquo;t go into now, to weigh the spirit or the soul at the time of death, there is always a half ounce change at the point of death. I realize that humidity and many many other factors the scientists have taken out of this, but it boils down to there&rsquo;s something that weighs a half an ounce that leaves the body at the point of death, it takes a very fine scale, but it&rsquo;s always a half ounce. Now what is that, the spirit or soul that leaving the body? Adano: Well let me explain that in terms of another experiment and we can see. In the human being we can&rsquo;t capture the thing that is escaping out, but let us subject a piece of material to an experiment where we can capture what is escaping out of it. 1:10 Let&rsquo;s take a piece of tungsten, four ounces, and bombard it for a while and it takes at least 20 minutes to bombard it in a neutron chamber or an atomic pile, let&rsquo;s bombard it, and then let it cool down and we have a residue. Now if we weigh that residue we&rsquo;ll find we have lost one ounce, now we have three ounces left, but the energy where did it go, where did it escape that lost that weight. Now if we bombard it again, we find that it takes us 40 minutes to bombard it to loosed it up and when it cools down again, it became two ounces instead of three. Now we bombard it again, but it takes us 80 minutes to bombard those two ounces and we find it reduces itself to an ounce. Now we bombard it again and it&rsquo;s taking 160 minutes but it cools down back and nothing is lost, we still come back to an ounce and no matter how we bombard it, it&rsquo;s still taking 160 minutes to bombard, it&rsquo;s still going back to an ounce. This is a phenomena in time will be observed, it&rsquo;s the same relationship that is happening to our mechanism. We have made a change in some way the time capsulated from one thing to another or it escalated in fact where the mass condensed. Now we weigh an ounce less when we die, is that the weight you said? Audience: Half ounce. Adano: Half ounce, that energy that&rsquo;s in this structure is a form of matter in its own density, much finer and higher, and it&rsquo;s released and it&rsquo;s there. Now it will feel like cobweb if you pass through it, protoplasm or ectoplasm, it will feel like cobweb when you touch it. Now Masters who have realigned the atomic structure of the body by meditation, they don&rsquo;t lose anything, this is one phenomena, they don&rsquo;t lose anything, they are the same individual&hellip; Audience: They change the texture? Adano: No, what happens now, here you&rsquo;re looking at a carbon based body and the carbon based body throws a shadow, when we transform this body into a silicon based body like glass, there is no shadow. Now I walk I leave a footprint, an impression, because I&rsquo;m carbon based already, when I&rsquo;m silicon based or a harder carbon which is like a diamond now, I leave no impression, I leave no shadow, therefore light is passing through me and you cannot see me at the range of calibration of consciousness of vision, this calibration is what we accept, extend the calibration to what we say clairvoyant, we see where the light is passing through that, individual is not gone anywhere, he&rsquo;s right there, but we got to understand the atomic sciences in which we&rsquo;re living all the time, we gotta understand that this is God, or consciousness if you want to call it, or spiritual knowledge, it is the same thing. We have a carbon body which throws off a shadow which the light impression makes and if you take silicons and you coat an object you know how much temperature it can resist? The army has tried it out on a little piece of paper or a piece of plate, they coat it with silicons and expose it to about nearly 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, didn&rsquo;t even bend at all. Now they take it and coat it on an automobile and expose it to 200 below Fahrenheit, minus 200 and still it didn&rsquo;t affect it. So we&rsquo;re seeing something strange about this silicon in the structure. Now silicon passes light because that it glass, which we call a silica sand, we apply heat to it, it expands, it becomes glass, it allow light to pass through. Now if we have the same chemical structure within us, 16 basic chemicals plus trace elements, we&rsquo;ve got it already in here, we&rsquo;ve got a brain with ten billion cells to the 25th thousand power, we&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t begun to use that yet, we&rsquo;re only using one tenth portion of it, we don&rsquo;t use the 360 degree angle of the brain focused. So if we learn how to accelerate by breathing which is hyper oxygenation or hypo ventilation, we will gradually change the cellular structure, we change it and shed off carbon. Now let&rsquo;s see what this scientist came here to teach. We will verify from him the science of Kriya Yoga. &ldquo;Kriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen.&rdquo; Today I was asked what a modern man would look like in the year 2000 as we enter into more space flight. Man would look exactly has he looks, but because he has controlled the conditions to survive in more miniature form and learn to survive less and less on solids and liquids, he&rsquo;s gonna learn to utilize the oxygen in his entire tissues which is 80% liquids already and what is water, H2O, we have it already locked up in us. What is breath, oxygen, we&rsquo;ve got it already locked up in us. Now let&rsquo;s see, it says decarbonize and recharge with oxygen, we have to decarbonize the process in order to utilize the principle of light. &ldquo;The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers. By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of KRIYA by which they caused their bodies to dematerialize at will.&rdquo; Now we can by understanding this process, this is an electrolysis process that we are doing, nature is doing it for us, don&rsquo;t think nature is not doing this thing for us, she&rsquo;d doing it so slow at her rate it will require a body to live a million years for the brain to express this whole thing and she&rsquo;d doing it at her rate, every seven years she&rsquo;s releasing one little function in the brain, this is what is happening every seven years. Audience: And this is what your Kriya is supposed to speed up. Adano: Right, Kriya is supposed to speed it up in a period of 40 years, it takes 40 years to take a moronic brain to full cosmic conscious brain. Audience: Well considering the long haul we&rsquo;re not much better than a moronic brain. Adano: Right. Audience: No, I think you&rsquo;re right by comparison to what the potential is&hellip; Adano: But having arrived at cosmic consciousness, that is not the end of our existence. Audience: That&rsquo;s the beginning? Audience: That&rsquo;s almost the end for me (laughter), I&rsquo;d feel like I&rsquo;d done something. Adano: No because Cosmic Man has work to do. What&rsquo;s he gonna do? You think he&rsquo;s just going to flit around with a pair of fractured wings and a broken halo somewhere around, playing some broken&hellip; Or have some kind of a monkey chain hanging him and flying around? No he&rsquo;s Cosmic Man and they&rsquo;re civilizations upon civilizations in the cosmos, in the making of the cosmos already that are not yet materialized by Man. As Man delves into his consciousness of a cosmic nature, he&rsquo;s gonna see prototypes, he gonna see all the different structures of future architecture, future manifestation, and as he brings it down to the level of manifestation, he would move onto that point. Audience: Well he&rsquo;s also aiding in the evolution of the material world as he becomes more evolved himself, he involves the world around him. Adano: &ldquo;If I be lifted up, all men would be lifted up.&rdquo; This is the meaning when He says Man has to go back into himself and create interest, don&rsquo;t let the spiritual interest die in the person. That&rsquo;s why He has the attitude which is love, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all thy mind and heart and soul and love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; this is first basic but then this basic thing has to have&hellip; if you take the word LOVE and revolve it around it means EVOL-VE, leaving out OVE again is love, EVOLVE it&rsquo;s evolving out, it has to reach out so it reach out by interest, by motivation, it reaches out by service. Now only those who have exposed themselves to this particular condition or honest with themselves, know that this thing exists, there&rsquo;s no one else that can convince you because you have to prove it to yourself that if you have an interest or no motivation you can&rsquo;t render service. Now when you&rsquo;re rendering service or having motivation, you&rsquo;re going to be involved with people, who are you going to do it to, can&rsquo;t do it to this (bangs on cabinet), this don&rsquo;t need it, it&rsquo;s still another human being. There is where the problem comes in because human beings are the product of time, when they came into manifestation they came in at a particular time, that moment decides their whole psychological make-up so we have to know astro-psychology, we have to know people thoroughly, how they function because astrology today. We have to understand people at their time sequences, why they act and react, there are 12 types because of the Zodiac. Now if a space program is repeating something that was once condemned as charlatan practices, why are they calling it Gemini and Jupiter and every crazy name, why don&rsquo;t they call it something else? Because we do have an established Zodiac already up there, it&rsquo;s not going to go anyplace, we&rsquo;re running into it. Now once we know astrology or astro-psychology, then we can recognize para-psychology or extrasensory perceptions, this is the other nature of Man, then we recognize the spiritual nature of Man which is meditation, then when two merge we have realization. So Man has to build his consciousness but start someplace. Audience: Adano I&rsquo;m gonna ask a question on astrology, I was reading an article by I think it was Cyril Fagan the other day on sidereal astrology pointing out that everybody else is making a mistake here, that for one thing the Aquarian Age is not beginning now, but will not begin until around 2376 AD based on sidereal astrology, have you read anything on sidereal astrology? Adano: Exactly, the last convocation I heard (inaudible) talking at Harmony Grove in LA, he figured out it would be around the 2200 period, 2300, but let&rsquo;s say give or take a few hundred, the year 2000 all the Piscean influences are off, we&rsquo;re in the Aquarian. We&rsquo;re not in the Aquarian Age, we are in the cusp of the Piscean / Aquarian Age, you see we&rsquo;re in the cusp. Audience: Well as long as you&rsquo;re not going to quibble about a few hundreds years, well then I really haven&rsquo;t any question. Adano: No because I said the other night around the year 2000 we&rsquo;re coming into the Aquarian Age, we&rsquo;re in the cusp right now, the cusp is fading out. Audience: Cyril Fagan has checked and checked and rechecked and he&rsquo;s just about right if he said&hellip; Adano: Yeah, it is about that period to be exactly on the node of the Aquarian Age, we will be just on that point then in full swing. So let&rsquo;s say the first 200 of the year 2000 we have just entered what is called a moving up arc and towards the year 2000 Piscean Age all has been washed out already, we just slipped out of our clutches. From now to the next 30 years, I&rsquo;d say from now to the next 30 years we&rsquo;re coming out of all the influences of the Piscean impact of the cusp, of the Aquarian cusp. Audience: You know Paul I have an idea that Cyril Fagan is getting all his information through meditation because of the things he had said in his articles, things that have come to him and he doesn&rsquo;t spell it out but he gives them as the gospel. In other words, he has checked them and double checked them&hellip; Audience: According to what information? Audience: Well I&rsquo;ll tell you what I read the other day that nearly threw me especially in view of the Autobiography and that is he was saying since Man&rsquo;s body seems to be such a high percentage of carbon, it stands to reason that his prime food, a necessity, is carbon. Adano: No, no, no you see the Sages tell us we must follow Solar Nutrition and that is a very low carbon content, though it&rsquo;s a carbohydrate product, fruit or leafy vegetables, they are of the 5% bracket and they only allow up to 8% bracket. Now you look at all the Oriental cooking, their vegetables of a carbohydrate nature ends up about 10%, in the 10% bracket, they don&rsquo;t go over the 10% bracket up to the 15% or 20% bracket. Audience: You mean they don&rsquo;t use beans and lentils. Adano: No, no, they don&rsquo;t use any of the potatoes and stuff, they are the higher bracket of the carbohydrate. Though they use rice because rice falls between 10% and 12%. Audience: Is that all? Audience: Rice is a great protein. Adano: It is a protein, but you see the Sages say if we follow Solar Nutrition we couldn&rsquo;t go wrong because our intestinal tract would obey, we are a product of our solar function, that means the Earth revolving around the Sun and revolving on its own axis would take off from that principle of electromagnetic reaction. Audience: I only get about two or three baked potatoes a month now, you mean I have to do without those too? Adano: (Laughing) No, you can eat the thing, no, let me show you one thing what I mean. In Solar Nutrition we have dawn where the cosmic rays are at a slant and in certain areas the cosmic rays pounds per square inch are more than other areas, that&rsquo;s why certain fruits and vegetables do have high potencies, especially in the high areas like in the Himalayas and so forth. Those areas where they are grown high, the potency of the electrical charges are stronger. Even for meditation it&rsquo;s stronger, except in this country, I find only in the California regions which is part of old continental (inaudible). You see California is still part of the old continental (inaudible) so the vibration are still strong and the cosmic rays beam in better. Now the tree grows high off the ground, the slant of the rays because the Earth is moved in relation to the Sun so the rays are hitting the tree. So fruits and nuts are the first food the intestinal tract can assimilate easily because Man gets up in relation too to these movements. See his body moves but he is pretty dumb and ignorant of it, he don&rsquo;t pay no attention so he can trick nature for quite a while till nature takes its toll. So it affects him and if he gets back in track with it, he&rsquo;ll find fruits and nuts are ideal. Now an intestinal tract should not grind the food up too much because there are certain foods that the intestinal tract cannot dissolve and only from a colonic and an irrigational process we gonna prove how certain foods don&rsquo;t dissolve no matter we put it in intestinal tract, it comes out by flushing it out. So if you take the nuts and grind them into a butter form or powder form and mix it into the juice or fruit and consume it. 1:30 Now at midday when your Earth is moving into position of the direct lines, vegetables that grow above the surface have the rays penetrating them. Now that doesn&rsquo;t say you can&rsquo;t eat the cow that lives above if you want to eat it or the pig or the sheep or the lamb or the chicken, they are walking on the surface, but chickens and birds they roost in trees so we see they have something in their favor too, they&rsquo;re a little better than the cow or the pig. Now those foods you eat at midday, leafy vegetables, and that&rsquo;s the time you can eat your peanut because peanut is not a nut, it is a legume and you don&rsquo;t eat it cooked, you have it raw, powdered form or butter form, and at evening time when the rays are off, now you can eat those food that grow under the ground where the sunlight never shone on. Audience: That&rsquo;s when you have your potato? Adano: You potato or your potato soup or your carrot juice, your beet juice, onions, and all the different things and the cycle repeats itself, but that doesn&rsquo;t say you can&rsquo;t eat seafood at night, you see. Now the ancient men had worked these principles out but they were not going to try to force it down nobody&rsquo;s throat because here is something you&rsquo;re living with, it&rsquo;s there like a clock, we don&rsquo;t pay no attention so we mix everything up because we have to eat. Audience: Well pretty soon the fellow who has something to sell, he&rsquo;s not gonna let you get by saying when it should be eaten if he has to make a profit on it. Adano: Quite true. Audience: You know interestingly enough, gosh it must have been 20 some years ago, when we first got interested in studying foods we found this booklet and this one was on tree fruit and we were quite surprise to get something like that from the government that had been prepared for distribution, but they came out flatly and said that fruits and nuts are Man&rsquo;s highest food because it&rsquo;s up closer to the Sun, it has a higher rate of vibration, and Man at his highest&hellip; Audience: You mean the government printed that? Audience: Yes, you read it to me when we lived there on Agnus. Audience: I read a book called &ldquo;Tree Crops&rdquo; but I got that at the library. Audience: No this was a thing you got from the government. Adano: Years ago I remember reading one of those books because I was tracking it down myself and there&rsquo;s a friend of mine, he&rsquo;s a Canadian / French fellow, he&rsquo;s a scientist, he checks the positive and negative charges of the food and that is what the Orientals have called the yin and yang system of eating, what is called the positive foods and the negative foods, it&rsquo;s called Microbiotics and the Japanese have come out with the Microbiotic planting, this is a name they&rsquo;ve devised where you plant positive foods and negative foods and how to combine them. Audience: That&rsquo;s like putting your onions around your rose bushes. Adano: Well they&rsquo;re very aware people when it comes to gardening because&hellip; Audience: They&rsquo;ve had to learn to get the most out of the littlest bit of ground. Adano: So if we go back to nature being positive and negative, we find that all these things are with us, but in building a temple from a physical standpoint, food is there, you have to eat food, you don&rsquo;t deny it. Audience: Well we don&rsquo;t have to gorge which some of us do at times. Adano: That&rsquo;s why I said the vegetarians look more sick or sicker than the meat eaters, but give them time, give them time, their refined nature, their refined consciousness, and the cellular structure will change in time. Now at Paul said, most people who come to that type of living come when they&rsquo;re already sick, but even it does so much for them to extend the time&hellip; Audience: Well the usual thing, their sickness is the thing that has driven them to thinking, it&rsquo;s an adversity that started the thinking and then that leads them to a way out is the usual thing. Adano: Yeah. Audience: Can you extend time? Adano: Yes, that&rsquo;s what we were discussing tonight, the various extensions of time. You can extend the time in all your processes of living. You see your supposed to live seven times twenty-one, but we don&rsquo;t live seven times twenty-one because society has brain-jammed us, which you call hypnosis, that&rsquo;s the term they use, but it&rsquo;s brain-jammed, the brain wave is jammed to accept 65 or 70 as the terminal point of existence of Man and the insurance companies are busy worried about how the wives are going to inherit more money than the husbands, five years longer (laughter). You see they jam your brain so fast by the time you get to 45 you&rsquo;re looking at how the downgrade of your own life is going to (inaudible). Audience: It isn&rsquo;t only the insurance companies, your employment&hellip; Adano: It&rsquo;s so ridiculous, but Sages centuries ago had a system which they worked out and called time-span extensions. You have the first 30 years, which is your first breath of extended time, you know we say you got your second breath or your third breath when you&rsquo;re running, well 30 years is the first span. And then the second span is 60, the third span is 90. Audience: You know that corresponds with the Saturn, it takes 30 years, Saturn rules time. Adano: It&rsquo;s based on cosmological laws, it&rsquo;s nothing we invent you know, you can&rsquo;t invent these things, they are there, they&rsquo;re observed, and they repeat themselves until we learn the lesson. It&rsquo;s going to hit us on the head all the time until we learn the lesson and Saturn rules law, the teacher, you know he&rsquo;s the disciplinarian, Saturn is the disciplinarian, he&rsquo;s going to discipline you until you learn truth. So we have the truth in us, 30 years, then the fourth is 120. Now if we make the 120 and we&rsquo;re fortunate, then we have what is called double-time extension, not until that time can you get double-time extension. Audience: Now what do you mean by double-time extension? Adano: It jumps up now. Audience: You mean you can ask for 240 years&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1965---meditation-kriyas">1965 - Meditation Kriyas</h2>
<p>Adano65_MeditationKriyasQ1RRNW6 - (Indian music playing in background). Meditation is one step further than prayer. That doesn&rsquo;t say that man does not pray and I don&rsquo;t want you to go away with the ID (idea) that this is going to detract from a religious involvement of your life that you pray. Far from it. I am only trying to point out that by the meditative process of disciplining the emotional nature, you will really know how to pray for the first time and discover that prayer is a means of communing with the higher self. In the meditation, you are asked to just close the eyes, but don&rsquo;t fall asleep. Try to keep the spine straight and don&rsquo;t strain, be as comfortable as possible because this entails conscious effort and the conscious effort is discipline. Now the vital energy flows through the vital nerves and through the five senses into the physical organs and you are involved with the outside world through the senses of seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, and touch. Now, everything involved in that outward realm is retained in the brain as language and the association through language. In the meditative principle, or disciplines, we will shut down one of the avenues. That is the lids of the eyes, vision, and through this shutdown attitude, the discipline of sight begins. While we close the eyes and look within and not falling asleep, we have a sense or tendency to become more aware of our existence. Thus a stepping up of your inner consciousness and you begin to realize that the sense of hearing is taking over more. The sense of smell, the sense of taste and touch are also becoming acute to the extent that they are becoming extra perceptive. And as we gaze at the point between the eyebrows with our eyes closed, keeping the mind there, gradually we will see a light or a radiance, a luminescence. Now the mind has a tendency to drift only because it was involved with the external realm and this is a form of discipline by trying to observe what the mind is latching onto, what particular ID (idea) or word or association or thought or experience the mind is latching onto and through this conscious observation or conscious discipline, the mind sometimes recognize an idea or a thought creeping up from the past, some past experience. Now if it is associating with that experience, eventually the emotional nature will become frustrated. If the mind is latching onto something concerning the future, sooner or later the emotional nature will end up in anxiety. Now if the mind is involved in the present, now, what it is actually doing in relation to the body, then the sense of breathing, the function of breathing begins to slow down. In the scriptures it is said, &ldquo;God breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; At this very moment in the present Now as the consciousness identifies itself with the present and the slowing down rate of inhalation and exhalation, Man is given an opportunity to experience his Soul awareness. The Soul partaking of the qualities of the Divine exhibits omnipresence, that it seems to reach out and be present everywhere in Consciousness, it seems to radiate into unlimited existence. Here begins the devotional workload of communion with the universal spirit, God, ever conscious of the present Now. The vast ocean of peace and tranquility is all around you now in the form of consciousness and the personal discipline of watching, the personal vigil is the linkup with that vastness of consciousness from within ourselves. 0:10 (Meditation.) Now slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move, try to hold on to the peaceful after effects, but don&rsquo;t open the eyes too full, just partially because through your self-observation there&rsquo;s a sensation of peace around you, in you, and coming through from within you. There&rsquo;s a reservoir of peace flowing out from within. Now with this partially open eyes we gonna dive deeper back now into that vast ocean of consciousness again. So let us gradually close the eyes and go deep in now into deep ocean of consciousness, of peace. Do not fall asleep, be conscious that you&rsquo;re applying personal effort, self discipline on your emotional nature, aligning yourself with God the internal light within yourself. (Chanting Om.) 0:20 You don&rsquo;t see one man having something more than you, you see the universal-ness of it, it&rsquo;s a natural science. Now this Kriya which quickens the evolution and every one minute of it equals 365 days of cellular change. If it takes 365 days to make certain changes in the mechanism, one Kriya done correctly, with the right temperature changes in the mechanism, have the exact result, the exact thing can be measured and it will be measured in time. Right now there are certain professors working on electrical equipment to verify just that, at UCLA right now, to verify just the facts about the Kriya science. We&rsquo;re going to verify these things for Western Man more and more because we need to verify it. You see valid knowledge cultivates devotion, which cultivates faith, but to believe without valid knowledge cultivates superstition. So we have centuries of superstition brought on on us. Now that is no fault of no one, it&rsquo;s the fact that valid knowledge could not be given to people before their time. We must have valid knowledge to work from so that we cultivate the devotion to it, then we cultivate the faith in it. So we see God is a far more greater thing than we anticipated It to represent, we are moving to bigger and better understanding of self. If you do one Kriya from the initial start to the initial end, you will just have a slight registration, this is a funny phenomena too. It takes at least three Kriyas to have the equivalent of one Kriya, now you&rsquo;re going to come into Einstein mathematics, three equal to one, how you get this kind of mathematics, three equal to one, what happened to the other two? If you start something from rest and raise it to a point and bring it back down, if there is no repetition or recurrence, you&rsquo;ve grounded the electrical charge, so it cancels itself out. So if you start off, one, two, three, now you notice the first and last one will cancel themselves out and you have a genuine center one, only the center one was a genuine movement. So the center one, or number two, actually registered on the mechanism, you see what I did? You start from here, go one, two, three, but if I did one, there is no registration. If I did two, one/two, there is no registration, but if I did three we have a registration, one, two, three, the center one registered because it was making a complete loop in itself, see? One, two, three&hellip; Audience: You mean before and after? Adano: Before and after cannot register as I said why we have eight years, six months before and after, the seven year period we see the same natural law applied and nature applying itself back to the microcosm, the same principle is applying there, it doesn&rsquo;t change. The Eastern people did not change it, the Western people can&rsquo;t change it, just understand the terminology. Jesus would say &ldquo;As in Heaven, so it is on Earth.&rdquo; As it exists in what you call &ldquo;empty space,&rdquo; you call it empty space, but there is no empty space, it exists in manifested space, this is manifested space, mass, so as it exists there, it exists here. Now we cannot see much of it here, why? Because we are limited to certain degrees of measurement, we can only see these things on larger scales of measurement, so we have to step off this planet to experience these conditions and see these things in its true nature, but the sages did this in a different way, they did not do it by the extension of their senses, they did this by the independence of the senses. 0:30 Now we in the West are doing many things though the extension of our senses, we take a microscope see something that is minute, we take a telescope to see something that is far, but these are registration of measurement, minute and distance for eyes you see. Whereas independence of is to get in and transcend and to do that would have to mean that you would have evolve up, you&rsquo;ll have to speed up, accelerate this mechanism. So if this is an acceleration, one, two, three, what is happening you have one minutes equal to 365 days happening to the human body, you&rsquo;re having an acceleration that is unique. So if you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, now if you look at the fan of a motor, what is it doing? An automobile has a certain RPM, now you take a bigger fan, a larger RPM, and put it in front of the automobile, it&rsquo;s going to lift the automobile off the ground slowly, put it bigger, we&rsquo;re gonna get it higher so it&rsquo;s gonna push, so we say we&rsquo;re flying. You see the accelerations all changing itself yet we are calling it evolution. If we accelerate this mechanism, consciousness is speeded up, it widens out, and we begin to perceive now dimensions that were not there to begin with, we see what was not there, the arc opens for the first time and we see the truth about ourselves. Now, no one likes to know that he has been following something for centuries and all of a sudden to wake up one day and find out he&rsquo;s a fool. It hurts him, but it&rsquo;s the best way to start. So we hurt hurt one time and to pick up from the broken pieces and start all over to fit them together. For centuries the layman has always known he lived in a three dimensional world and not too long, thing about ten or fifteen years ago we went to the movies and we see two dimensional movies and one day we says, &ldquo;one day we&rsquo;re gonna have 3D, three dimensional movies,&rdquo; you see, but it&rsquo;s a strange phenomena when you tell him it&rsquo;s impossible because all these things are there, he says &ldquo;well I don&rsquo;t see these things, I only see two and I see three now.&rdquo; The fourth one was there too, but he doesn&rsquo;t see that. Well here is an object, more of us will say we see the length of it, the width of it, and the depth, none of us say we can see the time in it, yet the time is there. When you measure with your stick and this is what Kriyas is trying to find out to you, how you accelerate yourself and you measure, you&rsquo;re using a measurement for length, breadth of a substance, where is the fourth thing, the time in it? You&rsquo;ve got a measurement on your hand which is called a clock, it measures time, so it&rsquo;s existing now five or seven minutes after nine, 1965, and this is another name relating to a condition, and if I say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s existing in motion,&rdquo; you say &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s static,&rdquo; and I show you that this thing left a certain&hellip; and I lift it up and throw it across the room at you at a certain speed, it will reach in front of you in a given time, the motion was already there, it had to travel a certain distance in a given time, so you measure that given distance so that is another dimension. Dimension is only a measurement, you see the fifth one there. Now the idea to lift it and throw it is mind, so this thing also has a reaction to mind because it&rsquo;s all of a sudden idea and another man&rsquo;s idea who molded a substance to make it look like this, to register to you back, to your mind to photograph mentally. So you got that next dimension there, the idea pattern, the amount of pressures applied on the substance to mold it and finally we see the will, the intensity to make it against all the odds, everybody calling you a crazy nut when you say you want to make something. You even run into people who say, &ldquo;oh my, you&rsquo;ll fail before you start?&rdquo; Everybody&rsquo;s trying to tell you you&rsquo;ll fail before you start to do anything, your will is there and you say &ldquo;where there&rsquo;s a will there is a way.&rdquo; Now we see it there, now Kriya is showing you this, if you can realize that all this is here in this body and if you can make this revolution in the spinal column and an alteration of the temperature ratio, you have done exactly what nature would do if you eat, sleep, went to bed, got up, work, in 365 days, you would have the same adjustment. That is a slow movement, this is a faster movement, it&rsquo;s a measurement movement, one is speeded up. Now, the first thing you will notice if you take eight years to do a certain amount of studies of science, you will find all the ups and downs: the resistances, the adjustment periods, the mutation periods, the molding of pattern periods, the saturation period, the lag, the frustration periods, and eventually the new recurrence or the new impetus, start all over for eight years. In any problem you going through this same repetition over and over, you don&rsquo;t seem to get out of it, it becomes like a rat race, you&rsquo;re stuck. Now your attitude has to come back to yourself to get this thing to go into yourself. Now if you can recognize this, you can speed these various movements up, the various resistance periods can be reduced, the period of adjustment can be reduced, the period of change can be reduced, the period of molding or pattern can be reduced, the period of saturation, the period of boredom can be reduced, the period of lag, or the new impetus, the new inspiration, all can come on faster because it is coming from the Self. We say that is coming from the superconscious mind or Cosmic mind, the new inspiration, the new ID (idea), the new impetus, the new drive, coming from there only because we are stimulating it, we are revving it up, we&rsquo;re revving up the motor, as you rev it up, your brain starts to work faster. Now, as it works faster, the first phenomena is always calmness, you&rsquo;ll never find that when you realize yourself, you&rsquo;re going to be in a state of agitation, you&rsquo;ll find that your entire control of your mechanism is under your will, your will is always controlling each function and your always moving in full control because where are you going to use it, you see, the question is where would you use this force. Most of us, and for centuries, have used this force for many things. The Sages don&rsquo;t want us to use it for ridiculous things, They want us to realize the full potential and work for the uplift-ment of your fellow man and this is a hard concept to understand, that you have to work for the uplift-ment of your fellow man, most of us are working for the uplift-ment of himself. So we say, &ldquo;Good, I want Cosmic consciousness for me,&rdquo; and this is the attitude we all take, we&rsquo;re all guilty, I&rsquo;m no exclusion. The yearning for realization takes on a personal interest, self-interest, and before that self-interest became manifest, it was existing in a state of inertia. So you exert little effort and you get out of the state of inertia, and that&rsquo;s what Kriya is supposed to do for you as you exert a little effort, and you don&rsquo;t want to wait eight years to exert some effort because eight years nature is gonna push anyhow by pain or suffering to get out and do something to concern yourself. 0:40 With the Kriya you stimulate this action in your mechanism and you raise yourself from inertia, but the next step you go is your own personal interest, you want this information, this power, consciousness for yourself. Sooner or later you realize it&rsquo;s not for you, you couldn&rsquo;t use it, it&rsquo;s not you, it is for the whole of the universe, then you begin to act those actions necessary for the continuance of life. You don&rsquo;t act for things that are necessary only for you, you don&rsquo;t realize that some things you are doing are for the continuance of life around you until it&rsquo;s shown to you that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve been doing and this gives you a good feeling, well the good feeling is bliss. Now remember that word bliss, Kriya, when it revs it up, gives bliss, bliss is joy too you know. Now in the East we say Ananda, Bliss, we Exist is Sat, we are Conscious which is knowing and that&rsquo;s Chit, for the purpose of being blissful, Ananda, Sat-Chit-Ananda we classify it there in the East. In the West we have the same&hellip; a man said to Jesus, &ldquo;Master what is Your God?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;My God is a God of Joy,&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t name it anything else, He couldn&rsquo;t describe it anything else, He just described the word Joy and joy is related to bliss already. So if bliss and joy are frames of reference to a feeling and if you practice Kriya and feel the same thing, we see now we have a linkage, we see a common bond for the first time, there&rsquo;s a common bond going on, this universe is here for the joy of ourselves. Now this joy becomes ecstasy, we use this word ecstasy when the person is very ecstatic and he goes into revery. Yes he does, but what is ecstatic and what is revery outside is not ecstatic and revery inside, there are many going on inside, until you get inside you&rsquo;ll not see that, we can be deluded by the ecstasy, deluded by the revery too, and that becomes like an opiate just as much as chloroform or some narcotic is an opiate too for dulling the senses. Real ecstasy, real revery is something entirely different, the Sages even themselves will tell you, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get stuck in that, go on, march on, get beyond that.&rdquo; Now ecstasy, &ldquo;Ecs&rdquo; means out, and &ldquo;static&rdquo; means static already, out of the static manifestations, your sensual perceptions has to reach out of static conditions in order to see it in motion. So when a Sage looks at you and says &ldquo;this whole universe is in motion,&rdquo; you think he&rsquo;s nuts, you know. Scientists come along and validate him and says &ldquo;yeah, this whole universe is in motion,&rdquo; and everybody says &ldquo;oh my god, what did I follow?&rdquo; You find out the Sage was always right and we&rsquo;re wrong, the Sage knows what he&rsquo;s talking about, but the Saints can&rsquo;t shock us psychologically to make the bridge too fast because this will not allow us to want to discover ourselves. He feeds us like a mother feeds a child, a little at a time, you know, &ldquo;put it in your mouth, swallow, come on take some more,&rdquo; but if he was to give you the full shock of the knowledge of the science about yourself, you would (inaudible), the thing is that you can&rsquo;t stand the shock, so you have to be given a little at a time and you have to coax you with symbols, you know we&rsquo;re really reluctant at times, even to change from one thing to another. It&rsquo;s so ridiculous, when we see something that is much better for something that we&rsquo;re holding on to, and we put all our confidence that this is it and we see something better, we don&rsquo;t want to let go and that&rsquo;s attachment too. The Sages are (inaudible), &ldquo;let go, experience this, and you can come back,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t get stuck here, this is what Kriya is supposed to do for you, it is too rev you up, to loosen you up from within so you can speed up your adjustment period, you can speed up the resistance period, you can speed up the change period, it can speed you up to experience the saturation period in a shorter space of time. Imagine if you have food here, everyday they bring the same food, after a while you&rsquo;re going to be fed up, over and over the same thing one after the other, you&rsquo;re gonna be fed up. Now if you have that as an example of being frustrated and wanting, you have millions of things to be frustrated with. Now the Sage says Kriya is a quickening of this process or is an accelerating process which helps you to transcend the thing, adjust faster, get over it, and release yourself from it. As you understand that, He tells you at the same time, every time you do this Kriya and you alter this mechanism, you alter the electrical output&hellip; (gap in tape). &hellip; this is a strange phenomena, but those who have never seen it will not believe it. He&rsquo;ll take a fruit, and those who have seen it and done it in Houston&hellip; take a fruit and hold it, concentrate upon it and leave it and it will remain without rotting the normal way for a whole year, but that is not to boast, those things you don&rsquo;t boast of them, that&rsquo;s a law of nature you don&rsquo;t (inaudbile), it is there to demonstrate a fact about yourself. Why if I explain the laws you see the truth, if you see the truth, you don&rsquo;t use it for that demonstration, you use it for this, you use it to live properly, you live to solve basic problems that people have psychologically, physically, and emotionally or spiritually. Now that is only an illustration to tell them that you got life at your control. Now a Saint doesn&rsquo;t want to impress nobody, a Saint is a man who is practicing a regenerative principle, you are all saints in the making when you stop degenerating your mechanism and Kriya is to regenerate you, not to degenerate you. Now you say a degenerate is a person who drinks, falls down in the gutter, or hang around in the bars, that&rsquo;s a degenerate, the Sage don&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s degenerate. A degenerate is one who thinks and generates ideas that tear down the mechanism from within itself constantly, he could be sitting here and looking at you over there and be hating your guts and he is degenerating, you see, but I may not feel his hate, the hate (inaudible) bounce through me and go back to him, you follow what I mean, yet if he says he&rsquo;s loving me, he&rsquo;s generating again, but that love may come through by his gesture, his moods, and his expression and I will feel it, it will go back and it will nourish him. The Sages know that, that&rsquo;s why They say, &ldquo;regenerate yourself,&rdquo; by regenerating yourself you can now alter these mechanisms, you can altar these conditions, but you enhance this electrical frequency everyday by this Kriya. The actual technique is involved in initiation. Now there is where we come to this term &ldquo;initiation.&rdquo; No one get into the inner functioning of the science unless he is initiated and initiation is a sacred right. In the East, it was caused baptism at one time, John the Baptist says &ldquo;I baptist you with water,&rdquo; which is the outward symbol of initiation, &ldquo;and Jesus will baptist you with the Spirit,&rdquo; which is the inward initiation, but in the East the Masters they have all initiated their disciples and there is where the word disciple comes into. From the time the Guru initiates the disciple, He turns the electrical charges on and the disciple is polarized or magnetized with the Guru&rsquo;s force, they are linked now, endlessly, in time, there is no break. Your Guru will always be your Guru, time in and time out, body forms and body forms, the link is there, you never separate, always going on. Now the disciples of Jesus were linked to Him because He initiated them and each Guru gives the initiation to one disciple to pass it on, they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;keys.&rdquo; Now Jesus in the West gave the &ldquo;keys&rdquo; to one of his disciples and that was Peter, &ldquo;I give you they keys of the kingdom&rdquo; and the kingdom is the power in your self, &ldquo;I give you the technique that you can pass it on now to future disciples&rdquo; and each disciple of a Guru is given this initiation, is given the technique that he passes it on. 0:50 Now you see why we are linked to a group of Masters, you cannot jump into initiation and realize yourself by claiming some invisible individual as a Guru. He has to have lived, He has to have hammered out your consciousness with His will, He has to hammer you into form to points where you don&rsquo;t want to go, you lead a horse to the water, but this time the horse has to drink regardless he don&rsquo;t want to go. He&rsquo;ll hammer you there too, but the Gurus are not trying to do that today, years ago yes, not now, they&rsquo;re not forcing you, you know why, you destroy yourself at your own rate. We&rsquo;re not no longer going to force you to accept truth, as long as you want to destroy yourself at your own rate, we will be around, we&rsquo;ll let Mother Nature spank you as a naughty child and you&rsquo;ll come back to your elder brothers or spiritual brothers on the path of truth and they will give you back the truth but Mother Nature, they will let her do the work because they know the more we stray from truth, she has many ways to correct us. She&rsquo;s gonna let us invent our own self-destruction, our own self-sufferings, in other to discover truth, that&rsquo;s why the Guru&rsquo;s are not interfering. They would have interfered at one time, but no, not now, they&rsquo;re disseminating the truth, taking it for what it is, they know where they are, they&rsquo;re not gonna force no one. The truth is there, you want it, good and fine, don&rsquo;t want it, makes no difference, they&rsquo;re marching on. Man is marching on, either to his own degeneration or he steps out of the crowd and begins to regenerate himself, this is his choice. Now, why they want Kriya known again, not for any motive of personal gain, they only want the Kriya to be know, once and again in this age, East and West, that it will be recorded, made available at all times, whereas it was held in the brains of men, was never put down on objects as a record. Now if you record something, their personality comes out of the picture, Man would evolve and not want to pay respect to any of these personalities because he will get so sophisticated in his scientific awareness that no human being stands greater than himself and I could never say that, not even at the stage that I am, I owe all mine to my guru and Jesus would tell you the same, &ldquo;this is the way of righteousness,&rdquo; He owes all his to His guru, that&rsquo;s why he made John baptize Him. We must pay the reverence because it is the way of righteousness, which just means it is the attitude of the law of the cosmos that we respect that which is handed down to us, not from out of adoration or kowtowing or worship, this is the source you see and we must owe our respect to the source. Now all the great Gurus have come and They have many disciples and the various world religions are offsprings of these, well there is a common link in all of them, sooner or later we find the common harmony, the common knowledge, the common brother hood which is the common science. Once we realize that the man in the East is practicing exactly what you are practicing, he may call it a different terminology, but it&rsquo;s exactly the same, you&rsquo;re not going to go around and say &ldquo;that guy&rsquo;s a Pagan&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s not going to go around calling you a nut over here because once he realizes the same thing, then we find out we have now a giving forth of ourselves, the first time we can really give of ourselves. We are performing an action necessary for the continuance of life. So Kriya, when the energy is raised and lowered and the temperatures are changed in the spine, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of one year of natural evolution it takes three to give one. The actual technique is initiation, that I cannot give you until the person wants to initiate it and that is a sacred right. Now I&rsquo;m giving you the fundamentals that lead to the truth, has always been there, and there&rsquo;s a saying, &ldquo;if you have the right information concerning what is involved, you can take it from there and go on. If you don&rsquo;t have the right information then you&rsquo;re going to end up in blind alleys.&rdquo; Yes? Audience: This repetition of three, can you transpose that in the use in practical everyday. Would for instance practicing something for memory or practicing something for other purposes, is that sequence of three effective as a cycle in other things than as the Kriya. Adano: No no, the Kriya is basically for one thing, the enhancing of the entire mechanism at a ratio of one year to one revolution. The equivalent of one year&rsquo;s natural physical unfolding by nature, equivalent of one revolution from the spinal column. Now you have six centers and one grand center which we call the sun in Man and the six centers along the spinal column they represent exactly the sun and the planets or the zodiac. See we have 12 signs in the zodiac so you have six centers by polarity which means each one is a positive / negative function. When the energy rises and lowers itself and makes a transmutation the six functions relate themselves automatically with the zodiac. Now this may sound strange the word zodiac and all these things may seem way out in some paraphernalia or astrology but it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s genuine science because you couldn&rsquo;t put a spacecraft into space and not run into the zodiac you see? You have a zodiac here all going all by itself, it&rsquo;s a natural zodiac in there, so Man&rsquo;s evolution is space colonization and space transplantation, that is evolution, but only one phase of his evolution. Also Man&rsquo;s ability to live in space and Man&rsquo;s ability to govern himself through space and from space but here he lives on Earth it don&rsquo;t take really just only a planet here that got all the little Joe&rsquo;s here all god by themselves, you know this is a ridiculous thought, here we are all gods in this Earth and you look in the sky you see upteen billion planets but there&rsquo;s nothing there. We are gonna to find out many things that we don&rsquo;t understand right now here in this plane when we put ourselves there, there are lots of things we have to re-change and there are lots of things that we will discover that are happening here to indicate what is happening here. For instance, if Man on Earth has a basic ability, one of the basic abilities to accelerate his vision so that he can look through the wall and see what&rsquo;s on the other side and this is not a common trait, this is one function, this is an acceleration, so acceleration of vision so he calls it in his layman language &ldquo;clairvoyance&rdquo; or &ldquo;x-ray vision,&rdquo; this is one of the basics. Now this is not the overall aspect and if this planet is only four and a half billion years old you mean it tell me the light that is coming from the Sun at a rate of four and a half minutes, a hundred and eighty six thousand miles a second and other forms of plants are existing there who are behind us in evolution, what you see here is how preposterous thought we are thinking in ourselves, how foolish we&rsquo;re thinking. They are way ahead in evolution therefore alterations are going to be different. 1:00 Now if on Earth we have individuals having the ability to perform bilocation, you&rsquo;ll see me here and in Houston they can see me, that&rsquo;s bilocation to be in two places at the same time. Now if this is happening only on planet Earth and this is just a small one function of knowledge of this atomic mass and exerting the will upon it, you want to understand what is happening in more evolved life forms that this is passe, you understand? They will be doing things that we could not withstand here and some of the gurus have demonstrated it. Why they demonstrated it is to make us conscious of what we are. Now Man is constantly building and controlling his environment to suit himself and he has to take his environment with him wherever he goes, the Kriya scientist does not take the environment where he goes, he changes himself to the environment and he goes where he wants to go, time and space has no interference with him, any planet is there for him. This is a strange statement, sounds like fiction, but it&rsquo;s a fact of the Kriya science, these men are typical examples only we&rsquo;ve just seen a few, there are many silent ones working behind the scenes just like an African living in Africa who you may not know he&rsquo;s the chief of his tribe is working behind the scenes as far as your consciousness is concerned, see what I mean? You have no relationship to him so you don&rsquo;t know he exists, just as much he lives there all his life with his family and his tribe and doesn&rsquo;t know a place like Dallas exists and we also live in a world with many things happening and we don&rsquo;t know it exists and it&rsquo;s happening all around us because we don&rsquo;t have the consciousness to cope with it so Kriya is to quicken this overall consciousness to alter this mechanism to suit the environment. Now this will make you function better, more effectively in all aspects memory, anything you want. Another (inaudible) the fact is that if you do the Kriya this enhances those functions in your mechanism at a ratio of one year to one Kriya, do you get the picture now? Audience: Well I understand that you&rsquo;re suggesting that we do extend our senses and that we can extend them and that it&rsquo;s right to extend them, but that isn&rsquo;t the only thing we need to do, we need to create this vacuum that you were talking about first and learn Kriya, let&rsquo;s see what that other term was, you use opposite to extending your your senses to&hellip; Adano: Independent of&hellip; Audience: Independent of, you learn the independence of them in order to execute more effectively. Adano: You must first shut down in order to go forward as I said if you&rsquo;re in a craft and you want to raise one point you go the opposite direction and you end up the other point, if you want to go this, you got to go the other way, this is what you call space mechanics which is strange the term you have to use it but it is spiritual truth. As much as you retreat in this is how much you advance outward, this is another way of putting it, this is the one principle going on all the time. Audience: You go three step forward&hellip; Adano: Right, so you&rsquo;re making three movements to one, it&rsquo;s a funny phenomena but this is Einstein mathematics too. So the more we understand how we are living, we understand the complexity but nevertheless in the complexity there is simplicity. The simplicity is the fact that now you can bring your consciousness here at the point of yourself and feel it all the time. When you do this, the electrical charge is increased. Secondly, the peace, the serenity, and the sharpness of consciousness is there, the wisdom is there, it starts trickling in. It&rsquo;s not something you go around reading to memorize, it&rsquo;s not gonna come. The power of this knowledge comes down from inside, you gotta go into it, it&rsquo;s there, you follow what I mean, but you gotta practice the thing. Any other questions? Audience: I probably have but I don&rsquo;t want to hog the floor. Adano: No, let&rsquo;s just try a little meditation because we try to understand what meditation leads to Kriya and as I said this is a preparation for Kriya, we need to know a little more before we can do the actual initiation, that&rsquo;s again someone&rsquo;s choice. Why is this, I&rsquo;m telling you all the signs, how it came to be in this part of the world, where it was lost, how it comes back, where it is taking us. Now where it&rsquo;s taking us into space life and this is its destination in the first place, that&rsquo;s our destination in the first place. We&rsquo;re not here to walk around like little gods flaunting rosary and so forth, those are juvenile forms of religion, adult religion or adult living or maturity of consciousness is taking up your cross and following me, that&rsquo;s what Jesus meant. Now He could not say that if He was dead because He died on the cross and to say something before He died on it would be a ridiculous statement. He said this while He was alive, &ldquo;Take up your cross and follow Me.&rdquo; Follow me who? Not Jesus, we have to understand what this (inaudible) is talking about. You have to lift up the forces in your mechanism which come up this way and they come this way too as a positive and negative and they meet, where they meet they meet in me, the center. Where do you point &ldquo;me,&rdquo; do you pint &ldquo;me&rdquo; here, &ldquo;this is mine, this is mine&rdquo; where do you point? &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; if you want to identify who, &ldquo;me, mine,&rdquo; you always seem to be pointing at a central point. So take up these forces, positive and negative in the spinal column, and bring them back in and merge and when you merge the consciousness opens you see the reality, you see the first time what the reality is but you cannot interfere and you&rsquo;re not supposed to interfere, you&rsquo;re supposed to see where you fit in and you&rsquo;re supposed to render service, render action necessary for the continuance of it. That&rsquo;s why we heal but what do we heal? We don&rsquo;t heal Joe Doe or Mary Smith, the healing is based on healing the entire cosmos because Man is endowed and privileged to have a body form for the first time and many times, but every time it&rsquo;s the first time when he recognizes it. Anytime he relates himself to it as Being, the opportunity of cultural growth, cultural evolution, then he is enhancing the universe with his (inaudible). So what does he heal? He has to heal the entire elemental kingdom that has been disrupted, he has to heal the entire mineral kingdom that has been disrupted, he has to heal the entire vegetable kingdom, he has to heal the entire animal kingdom, he has to heal the entire human kingdom and that is not just to say on this planet earth, the entire, that means physical, astral, causal, and he has to heal the entire spiritual kingdom. Then he has to come back to the kingdom within himself which is the cosmic self inside. So when he does this, now he&rsquo;s never left out, see it is better to give than to receive because you&rsquo;re never left out and if I think of you and I&rsquo;ll show you a little illustration. Tonight on the reservations their meeting is going on and they heal like this. We&rsquo;re eight people in the room and if we healed, one man heals seven, and if each man heals seven, we have seven times seven so each man is healed 49 times. See the multiple force that is built up for one man&rsquo;s development and evolution by the aid of such a complex principle and yet a simple principle. You don&rsquo;t think of yourself when you vibrate this force so your ego is not in the place and yet you have 49 vibrations bombarding you for your upliftment and you have contributed to seven men you see, and seven men have contributed to you. Audience: I do have a question, the physical, mental, and emotional relaxations in which you referred, you mentioned some of the first indications or the various indications. Will you name those things that we can sense as indications of reaching the degree or degrees of relaxation? 1:10 Adano: The five senses begin to shut down. Now the body feels kind of flaccid, stiff, like if you&rsquo;re just waking up from sleep or you&rsquo;re going to sleep, the breathing slows down. Audience: Well I meant, you said calmness. Adano: Calmness, tranquility, these are first, a heightening of the electrification of the cells, the electricity is heightened. Calmness, tranquility or peace, you find this inner peace now, peace that passes all understanding, for the first time you have Shanti, you know profound peace, you&rsquo;ll find it for the first time within yourself, the profoundness of it. Now you feel this piece and it&rsquo;s profoundly deep and moving, everything is within itself and holy, then you feel the whole body is electrified, you&rsquo;ll notice also the texture of the tissues begin to change over a period of time, also you begin to notice the odor of the perspiration begins to change, the senses become more acute, they begin to accelerate now, your adjustment to heat and cold is faster, you walk into a cold room and your body adjusts to heat it up faster, so everybody&rsquo;s cold you&rsquo;re warm. You walk into a warm room, everybody&rsquo;s (inaudible) and you&rsquo;re cool, you see the evolution that is speeded up? These are some of, I&rsquo;m just giving you some of, I&rsquo;m not going to do deeper because if you can&rsquo;t get the &ldquo;some of,&rdquo; how are you going to get the other ones, then I&rsquo;m making this thing way out of proportion and way out of reach but the Masters never do that. They never made it tough, They made it tough for me yes. Audience: But some of these as you mentioned, some of these are mental, some are emotional, and some are physical. Some manifestations of each of these three areas where we would arrive at this relaxation. Adano: Well in the mental realm your whole attitude begins to change, you start to have a different perspective of things, you don&rsquo;t get as irritable, your moods they get to adjust faster, you don&rsquo;t offer as much resistance, you don&rsquo;t think up resistances, you don&rsquo;t let the resistance affect you. So you have an adjustment to the resistance which is psychological, you have a change to the resistance which becomes physiological and psychological, and you have a pattern, after 10 minutes the pattern is set in, you made it complete. Then comes the saturation, how long you want to stay in the atmosphere or that particular environment, then comes the lag because it drags on, then comes recurrence or new impetus, which comes out from the super consciousness because that&rsquo;s inspiration, you have a new idea to do things, a new way to do things then. So we say you will always have a new model of the same old thing and every year you&rsquo;ll always be looking for a new model, ever new joy is God, ever new model projection is cosmic self you see, you&rsquo;re constantly projecting the creativity of yourself. Now you&rsquo;re drawing from a cosmic principle, you drawing from God which is law, God is there, reverence is there, personality is there. Now these cosmic Masters claim, and I have to practice it myself, it&rsquo;s easier to think of God as Mother than to think of God as Father and if some of us here don&rsquo;t want to think they&rsquo;re that humble enough to think of God&rsquo;s as Mother, think of Him as Father, and some of us don&rsquo;t want to think of Him as any personality, God is the Conscious Light, God has become me, you see. Then we free ourselves from any so-called sophistication of mind but whatever you want to call Him, the whole important thing is that you got to feel it, you got to be in it, you got to experience the thing anytime you want to dip into it, It&rsquo;s there. Remember you can&rsquo;t drink up the ocean, you dip in the ocean all the time it&rsquo;s like a sugar, you don&rsquo;t want to become sugar, you want to have the ability to utilize the sugar momentarily. So meditation is a condition which you not only go in, you merge and get the consciousness that you needed, you come out you work, you apply action, you apply service. It&rsquo;s not to sit down and loaf with it, it&rsquo;s not going to do anything, you have to exert action. To exert action is to fit to the Cosmic Will so He says, &ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo; We are fitting ourselves to it. Does that clear up your question? Audience: Yes. This last thing you said then would be that you know, then you be, and then you do. Adano: Yes this is the sequence, you know, be, and do. This will eliminate all the&hellip; Now if you could pick up my thought waves that beam it into you, then you would know that all you have to do is this, then you&rsquo;re ready for whoever you want to work on, the force is here now, get it? But you can&rsquo;t so you have to pull back. Remember Masters, all of them have different ways of projecting it but can&rsquo;t impose, They do not impose, they have no&hellip; It&rsquo;s an inalienable right, you have the inalienable right to reject Them, this is your right. In other words you have the right to keep God out from your heart. Audience: That&rsquo;s the freedom of choice. Adano: That is the deterioration of the Soul. You see if you can choose to be spiritual and you can choose not to be spiritual, don&rsquo;t you see freedom of choice leads to deterioration? It isn&rsquo;t that choice is not important, don&rsquo;t get me wrong and don&rsquo;t go say Adano says choice is not important, choice is an important function, but unerring choice is the important function. How can you know you have unerring choice, by reason alone? Not possible, you have to transcend it, to transcend it is by intuition and intuition is to get back in independent of the senses. Then you can say you are executing unerring, an unerring choice leads to freedom, not free will, freedom, Jivanmutka, emancipation, liberation, liberation from the effects of your own self-created actions, it leads you away from those effects, you see the point now? Why you want an unerring choice, it leads you away from that. Now let&rsquo;s have a little meditation. (Gap in tape). Oh boy, times goes fast. You notice by letting the sound waves bounce on the body, the whole mechanism starts to get into a rhythm, feel, and before you know it you&rsquo;re starting to step away from the mechanism in consciousness, the consciousness does seem to expand, you&rsquo;re having your expansion in consciousness. See until one learns to feel more than listen, the sound waves bombarding the body, he would not understand the principle of mind and its function of acceleration. You would not be able to use thought waves properly because everything we see around us is a manifestation of thought waves and these thought waves help, being hammered by dominant will over obstacles to appear as they are. 1:20 So where there is a will there is a way but until we understand this principle we cannot use dominant will but the Masters have taught us to recognize evolution of the will and from that we can now develop dominant will. They tell us to watch a child when it&rsquo;s born, the moment they cut the umbilical cord, automatic will steps in, forces the lung to expand, air, breathe, cry, sound this is their first indication of automatic will, automatic volition, nothing moves except by cosmic will or volition, so they say if you study that indication you can see the next indication. The next indication is on thinking will, the child does not think for itself so you feed it and you tell it what to do and it parrots you so you are molding the child, the will is molded now if the parent is not evolved then we have undeveloped children. So we get the next stage, blind will where we see juvenile delinquents fall into, the first revolting, the first manifestation of psychological revolution is against the unthinking will to express itself, but it express itself blindly. Now in blind will we can be hurt by the social laws of man or by the cosmic laws around us, after a few hurts, a few mistakes, then we develop thinking will, we learn from mistakes and we trial and error. There our revolution seems to come to an end, we never seem to get out of that jackpot, we never seem to go any further, you go right up to the grave with your thinking (inaudible). Just a few of us seems to develop dynamic dominant will, to do that we have to understand this mechanism, that will power is desire plus energy, no desire, no energy, no willpower. Power is energy, will is desire, intrinsic craving but motivated by an idea so if you have the idea and you crave the idea, which is the concentration energy is released and you have dynamic will. So by picturing the idea, the sages teach to visualize the objects. We are entitled to anything we want, providing we want the consequences too, so we must learn the truth about ourselves. We have a right to manifest and we have a right to pay the price for manifestation, so we are responsible, you reap what you sow. Christian teachings is the same thing, eastern teaching the same, cause and effect, same law underlying it all, the power to visualize. If you visualize correctly and exert this dominant will or energy behind it, it&rsquo;ll materialize, but we must understand one thing if we have the willpower and this will power is equal to our desire plus our energy behind it, there is something in us that has to be canceled out and that is breath and one asks &ldquo;how is that possible?&rdquo; In the highest aspects of dynamic will you are breathless, the lowest aspects of the dynamic will you are breathing very fast, very shallow, and one little illustration is in fear. Your body is in the state of fear and you breathe very fast but your will is trying to exert control over this body to offset and some people say &ldquo;calm down, calm down, relax,&rdquo; these are words or suggestions to bring you back to yourself and if the breath tones down back, for a brief second if you make what is called breathlessness, there is a change. Each of us have passed through these phases but many of us do not realize this, we don&rsquo;t seem to relate it to ourselves but these are laws of life. So the sages have placed a formula for us always to apply dynamic will when we need it and that is desire or idea times the energy, which is the natural body power, times the breath, divided by the breath, that is the inhalation and exhalation, cancels each other out and we have conscious energy, conscious energy vibrates in an unobstructed universe. We live in an unobstructed universe because this is time space continuum. If the chances are million to one that you will touch an atom if you put your hand through that object because it&rsquo;s all empty space yet that empty space is waves, waves of consciousness and this object differs from that object by a rate of vibration and an idea is what you recognize it by, the impulse of the concentration is how you alter it. So we see it&rsquo;s possible now that what these Sages are talking lie within the realm of application. We have a choice to manifest, to convince ourselves, but this is not the reason why we can do that, reasons and purpose of true manifestation is to correct our behavior you see. Decisions all are examples of transcendental behavior, yet that is cosmic engineering, cosmic life engineering, they know the art of behavior, we don&rsquo;t know it. So we have ups and down, obstacles, every time we can picture the idea or the problem that is interfering and direct the energy anywhere, we have now psychosomatic reconstruction instead of psychosomatic destruction or disease. Now I show a psychosomatic disease, you can&rsquo;t take your hand down and this can be duplicated by hypnosis too. In psychosomatic reconstruction you can, if the hand is there, send the energy through it by concentration. Now this is no magic, this is law of life, this is God. Audience: What was this formula again? Adano: Idea times energy times breath divided by breath equals conscious energy. Until you understand the formula you can&rsquo;t use it properly, but if you can understand the formula and know that you live in seven dimensions right now, you can alter all your frequencies in the body to suit the environment you live in. Now this is man unlimited, not man the unknown or man the limited. 1:30 Audience: Let&rsquo;s see three physical dimensions and four etheric, right? Adano: (laughs) The fourth dimension is time, length, breadth, and width are three dimensions as an object and the fourth dimension is that the object resides in a certain time. Now this is a ruler, a watch is a ruler, what are you measuring? The time you came to this house, the time you go away, but the object is sitting in time. Now time is relative to the light of the sun on this planet, how are you going to relate your time? So that&rsquo;s a movement too, we take four and a half minutes from the sun to here so by the time the light gets here it&rsquo;s past time when it left the sun, it&rsquo;s four and a half minutes late, you understand? So you live in time right now, now that&rsquo;s the fourth dimension. Now also there is motion, if I was to lift you up and throw you across the room, that would be motion, it will take me a certain amount of time to move you across a certain distance and that will require a certain amount of power behind the idea of lifting you up and moving you, you see. So the idea to lift you or apply that pressure upon you to move you is mind and the volition is the desire and the energy locked up in it, which is the will, they&rsquo;re all here now, you don&rsquo;t have to go looking for it, it&rsquo;s here. So the Sages say conscious energy if you understand it, you now can focus your consciousness and bring the thing down into manifestation. I&rsquo;ll give you a little illustration. Once I went to visit my Guru&rsquo;s ashram in California and I went inside the place, a small room, and I&rsquo;ve seen food not in refrigeration just a little plastic paper over it, dated 1952 shipped from India in a state of non-decay, He just broke a piece to eat it, the rest is still there, (inaudible). Now we say that is miracle because we don&rsquo;t know, logical mind or untrained mind says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a miracle.&rdquo; Yes it&rsquo;s a miracle because it&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t understand and miracle is the limitation of your understanding but if your understanding is expanded it&rsquo;s no longer&hellip; (end of tape)</p>
<h2 id="1965---three-hour-meditation">1965 - Three Hour Meditation</h2>
<p>Adano65_ThreeHourMeditationQ2RRNW6 - In the meditation you&rsquo;re asked to just close the eyes but don&rsquo;t fall asleep and try to keep the spine straight and don&rsquo;t strain, be as comfortable as possible because this entails conscious effort and the conscious effort is discipline. Now the vital energy flows through the vital nerves and through the five senses into the physical organs and you are involved with the outside world through the senses of seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, and touch. Now everything involved in that outward realm is retained in the brain as language and the association through language. In the meditative principle or discipline we will shut down one of the avenues that is the lids of the eyes, vision, and through this shutdown attitude discipline of sight begins. While we close the eyes and look within and not falling asleep, we have a sense or a tendency to become more aware of our existence thus a stepping up of your inner consciousness and you begin to realize that the sense of hearing is taking over more. The sense of smell, sense of taste, and touch are also becoming acute to the extent that they are becoming extra perceptive and as we gaze at the point between the eyebrows with our eyes closed, keeping the mind there, gradually we will see a light or a radiance, a luminescence. Now the mind has a tendency to drift only because it was involved with external realm and this is a form of discipline by trying to observe what the mind is latching on to what particular idea or word or association or thought or experience the mind is latching on to and through this conscious observation or conscious discipline the mind sometimes recognize an idea or a thought creeping up from the past, some past experience. Now if it&rsquo;s associating with that experience, eventually the emotional nature  will become frustrated. If the mind is latching on to something concerning the future, sooner or later the emotional nature will end up in anxiety. Now if the mind is involved in the present, now, what it&rsquo;s actually doing in relation to the body, then the sense of breathing, the function of breathing begins to slow down. In the scriptures it was said, &ldquo;God breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; At this very moment in the present now as the consciousness identifies itself with the present and the slowing down rate of inhalation and exhalation, Man is given an opportunity to experience his Soul awareness. The Soul partaking of the qualities of the Divine exhibits omnipresence that it seems to reach out and be present everywhere in consciousness, it seems to radiate into unlimited existence. Here begins the devotional workload of communion with the universal spirit, God, ever conscious of presence now. The vast ocean of peace and tranquility is all around you now in the form of consciousness and the personal discipline of watching, the personal vigil, is the link up with that vastness of consciousness from within ourselves. 0:10 Now slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move, try to hold on to the peaceful after effects but don&rsquo;t open the eyes too full, just partially, because through your self-observation there is a sensation of peace around you, in you, and coming through from within you. There is a reservoir of peace flowing out from within you. Now with this partially open eyes we&rsquo;re gonna dive deeper back now into that vast notion of consciousness again. So let us gradually close the eyes and go deeper in now into this deep ocean of consciousness. Do not fall asleep, be conscious that you&rsquo;re applying personal effort, self-discipline on your emotional nature, aligning yourself with God the eternal light (inaudible). As the sense of hearing becomes more acute, try to focus it on the right ear and try to listen to the audible life stream flowing in and out around you. The divine cosmic vibration of life passing in the physical form, and right back into the atomic structure around us. By listening to the audible life stream, we are escalated up into consciousness, enter the consciousness of the divine nature. listening with the right ear is disciplining the sense of hearing, you are disciplining the sense of hearing and directing it back to its source, the fountainhead whereby the vital current flows in the human mechanism. (Inaudible) be relaxed within yourself and the surrender to the divine presence, indwelling spirit within us all. The internal self-surrender again is a discipline on the emotional nature. It&rsquo;s a discipline on the emotional nature to the presence of the divine life flowing in. Slowly open the eyes, not completely, half open, try to hold on to the peaceful effects of the environment. 0:20 Gradually open the eyes wider and adjust the light to the physical world but hold on to that inner attitude. Try to see how long in the waking state you can maintain this inner attitude of calmness, try to see how long you can hold on to this inner strength that is flowing through the mechanism in the waking state. Now if you feel in the mood to dive back deeper in there, go right ahead. It is your own personal reservoir of divine peace, drink as much as you want, no one can cheat you of it now, it&rsquo;s your own portable paradise, you don&rsquo;t have to search for it, it has always been with us. You are not the same people anymore after this, you have found the source of your being. From this source you have to learn to live daily through personal effort of discipline. O Spirit, Divine Mother, Beloved Jesus, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, our beloved Guru Paramahansaji, Mataji, and Saints and Sages of all religions, we bow to Thee all. Free our lives from all obstacles and may Thou be the only love reigning in our hearts and may Thy love shine on the sanctuary of our devotion that we may be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts. Om, Peace, Om. Divine Spirit, we are thankful tonight for this wonderful gathering for our beloved Sister Helen who made her home available for this spiritual Mahasamadhi ceremony and to all our brothers and sisters in the spirit who have come a long way to gather themselves to commune in spirit and to lend their spiritual power to aid certain Souls traveling through the bardos of consciousness. Masters, as a humble disciple I surrender my body tonight to Thy service but the energies may be used to help those Souls traveling through the Bardos and if it is Thy will they make their grade up to the clear white light, may they have a peaceful rebirth wherever they may be. For the symbols present we have the Earth, the Fire, the Air, and Water when the water time comes to be called for water. Representing the primordial elements from which the Soul came forth, but it must go back to Mother Earth, as we call the eternal womb, so the crescent is called the eternal womb which Man comes forth and goes back to. As Jesus says, &ldquo;Unless we born again we canst not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; The crescent is a focal point and we find it throughout all literature representing the eternal cosmic womb of rebirth, Right now on the reservation of the Indians in this country there is a ceremony going on and I&rsquo;m  trying to link my consciousness with them so we will be able to draw on their power and this ceremony will also be able to add to theirs, so we&rsquo;re in for a very good spiritual uplift tonight. Also in certain parts of India, Tibet, or China they are also having certain Mahasamadhi ceremonies going on so we&rsquo;re gonna really get the benefit tonight. Also the ceremony is to show how the Soul travels through the various Bardos to go to the consciousness. We have a few names here that I&rsquo;ve asked around who would like their name mentioned and primarily since tonight the house is dedicated by Helen here, I&rsquo;ll leave her friend&rsquo;s name for the last (inaudible). 0:30 (Chanting Om and praying for various people by name.) And to Bob Hardison, a friend of Helen, who is being buried this morning and this primary was dedicated to him. Join me in the first bardo, the Soul will travel up the first Bardo of the red light, so you&rsquo;ll focus your mind on red and all these Souls pre-mentioned are gathered in the red light and as you focus your mind on the red, try to think of the words I will repeat, freeing them of the attachment of the red light which is the attachment of the lower part of the ego and the attachments of food, which is represented here as rice, and material substance which is represented as money, freeing them from the greed and gluttony of the lower bardo. As you focus your minds on the red light, just let your mind dwell on the red light and lend your spiritual power and humbleness so that these Souls may have a joyous rebirth, for theirs is their rebirth now. With living threads of thy duty, my winsome wings were woven, endowed with a spark of immortality. I have flown from life to life, I escape from all who audaciously try to possess me, I only belong to thee oh Spirit, no transient enthralls me, my true home is thy changeless spirit, I return home. Thou hast clouded barren eternity in the (inaudible) of multi-colored cycles, in the forest of incarnations I flit gaily from tree to tree. I shall alight at last oh Lord upon Thy outstretched hand, Om Christ, Gurus. As we keep our mind on the red sending love freeing these Souls so mentioned from the gluttony and the greed of the physical realm and the lower parts of the ego. (Meditation period.) Slowly raise your hands above your head, still holding on to that red light in the consciousness. Now let us send out this sound of Om seven times. Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om. 0:40 As you feel love coming up from the heart as a warm sensation, slowly open the eyes and don&rsquo;t move, this ends the first Bardo. As I said before the model consciousness of Divine Mother represented as a crescent represents the divine womb where all things return back thus freeing them from gluttony and greed in the lower aspects of their ego, we must now try to carry them to the second level, we go to the water. (Meditation.) Place the water in front of the crescent. Divine Spirit, water is our sister that envelopes all forms yet the mind is not as clear as water. In the second Bardo the mind is suffering with many attachments still cloudy, it still drifts back to old associations of people on this earth plane, the Soul is not free. Let us close our eyes and picture the green light, the green consciousness that frees them, the green light to go, the purity of mind. As we think of this green light we send out freedom of the mind to the Souls also mentioned before and keep your consciousness on the words I&rsquo;ll repeat in the second Bardo. &ldquo;I may lose my way and roam in the darkness of the mind but oh my Divine Mother shining, luminous, let me see that tiny taper of divine remembrance of Thee be never extinguished by my gusts of disbelief. I only sought earthly things, now to finally discover that I can only crave Thee the purity of mind and consciousness. Come O Divine Spirit be with me always.&rdquo; Om Christ, Gurus. As we keep our mind on the color green sending them the freedom of mind, may the water purify your consciousness the water of spirit. Oh beloved Souls wandering in the second Bardo, if you find that your minds are still drifting back to the earthly plane we are sending you freedom that you may go on, that you may be free from the attachments of past associations of memory, and made a five Masters of Realization be ever present to bring you back to the clear blue and white light within. Those who are wandering in the Bardo of the green light and still have remorse and still are looking for repentance and looking for ways to correct themselves, fear not for the pure consciousness flows freely now. We who are gathered here send thee our pure consciousness in unison that you may draw and pass the test of the second Bardo whereby the consciousness may drift. May you pass with pure consciousness, accepting humility as the road out of the second Bardo. Freeing you from these desire patterns may you have the one desire for our cosmic Father that the light helps you to lift yourself up to the third Bardo. (Meditation.) Let us raise our hands above our heads and let us chant Om seven times. Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om. Slowly lower the hands still holding on to the green light. 0:50 Slowly open the eyes but still feel the love coming up in the heart radiating out to these the (inaudible) Souls, this ends the second Bardo. The last three Bardos are the most important Bardos of spiritual rebirth. We have now passed out of all the lower vestiges of the consciousness. Those who are have any clairvoyant insight would have already begun to see the flush of the white light around the crescent or would have seen one of the Masters radiating out, taking charge of the Bardos. As we go up the last three Bardos, these Bardos are the most important aspects of the Soul because we are going into an aspect where their lessons on the inner plane begin for them. If they are gonna have a high spiritual rebirth, how they pass through these lessons on these Bardos will help them to have a rebirth that is favorable to them, otherwise they suffer the remorse of attachment to the lower self. We go to the third Bardo which is gold, symbolized by the fire, already it&rsquo;s there, which is the Cosmic Vibration or Holy Ghost and since this is the Aquarian Age, the Holy Breath or Kriya is the one that liberates us. Since they have not had the initiation into Kriya, we do it by proxy and when you join me in chanting Om, I will do the Kriya on the third Bardo for them, as I raise my hands you just say Om. (People changing Om three times). We will keep our minds on the golden light and here we chant, &ldquo;Door of My Heart&rdquo; together. I&rsquo;ll chant, lead a chant, so the words aren&rsquo;t very difficult but as you chant &ldquo;Door of My Heart&rdquo; with me and the Kriya being done by proxy, their lessons begin on the heart chakra for them wherever they are on the third Bardo. If they have never come that far in development whatever lesson they may learn in the third Bardo begins with them now. We will help them through the Bardo, we are lending our spiritual love to them. So just close your eyes and think of gold. (All chanting four times.) &ldquo;Door of my heart, open wide I keep for thee. Door of my heart, open wide I keep for thee. Wilt thou come, wilt thou come, just for once come to me. Wilt thou come, wilt thou come, just for once come to me. Will my days fly away without seeing Thee my Lord. Will my days fly away without seeing Thee my Lord. Night and day, night and day, I look for Thee night and day. Night and day, night and day, I look for Thee night and day.&rdquo; Om, Christ, Gurus, still keeping your mind on the golden light and helping them to learn the lesson of the third bardo from the heart chakra, as your mind will dwell on these words, &ldquo;Make my Soul Thy temple, make my heart Thine altar, make my love Thy own. May Thine love shine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion and may I be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts.&rdquo; Om Christ, Gurus, still keeping the mind and the golden light and these Souls who are living in and drawn to the third Bardo for their lesson, as they are being freed from all attachments and the previous Bardos now entering into the altar of love, may they see for the first time clearly that love raining in the heart is a true lesson in the physical plane and where their hearts be opened, may their chakras be open to absorb some of that Divine Love and if they revert be of a higher nature, may that love that has been instilled in them tonight by those who are praying for their release and for the Masters who are carrying them through the Bardo, may that love remain and be instilled as a seed that may grow into something better in their next incarnation. 1:00 All those who have entered the third bardo in the golden light you will now see for the first time that there are no devils but yourself, there are no hells, there are no heavens, but thine own self, love. Long lost, long shut out in the darkness of pride and ego and shut out in the lower selves, those moments of love that could have grown in the earth plane were closed out. Living in the third Bardo for the first time through the help of the Masters may the consciousness glimmer what true love is coming from the heart center. As Jesus once said, &ldquo;On the earth plane, the pure in heart sees God.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the love that flows out from the heart chakra, allows the divine light to flow all around us in a golden light. (Meditation) Slowly raise your hands above the head and let us chant Om seven times. (Chanting Om seven times). Thank you. Still thinking of the golden light and radiating that love from your own hearts, your own heart chakras, and proxy helping those on the inner plane to help those within that Bardo. (Meditation) Slowly open the eyes, still feeling the love coming up in the heart. The fourth Bardo is the blue light of the Christ Consciousness if they have been lifted up by the Holy Spirit which Jesus spoke as the Holy Comforter or Cosmic Vibration, then their hearts and their heart chakra will be opened up for them to a certain degree how much they can take and hold on of that Divine Light. As we try to help them to go to the fourth Bardo or the Christ Conscious light which is blue, how much they were able to hold that light to get a glimpse of Christ Consciousness that is much they can take with us helping, we will act as a boosted charge for them in that Bardo. The Masters will help them to a certain extent, they have to learn their lessons of the Christ Consciousness, the malfunction of thinking. In the Christ Consciousness, Man is endowed with the ability to materialize his thoughts at will and to misuse his thinking powers is his mistake he would make in his downfall in the Christ Consciousness. Now how much of the mistakes they made in their own life they will see in the Christ Consciousness and then they will have to learn their lesson that they have to learn to think right and if they get a better rebirth, a lesson of right judgment, right thinking will come with them. Air is the element and that is all around us and to signify it we light the match which is the fire and let the smoke go up and it&rsquo;s gone back up into the air, the Bardo begins with the fire turning into smoke. (Adano lights a match) There it goes. We think of blue which is the Christ Consciousness and those who may be clairvoyant or who are very sensitive would have felt by now the presences and the energies moving through their bodies and would also see the white light from the crescent. It flashes like a little firefly, if you are conscious you will see it sometimes flashing there. So we start the Bardo with a chant again, &ldquo;Who is in My Temple.&rdquo; Well let me go over the words so you may understand what it is, &ldquo;Who is in my temple, all the doors do open by themselves,&rdquo; these are the centers in the spine and the body is a template and &ldquo;all the lights go on by themselves,&rdquo; no one turns them on by himself, it is turned on by the Gurus. The Gurus are the Ones who open these forces for us by our attunement to them. So it goes, &ldquo;Who is in my temple, who is in my temple, all the doors do open by themselves,&rdquo; the doors represent the seven centers and &ldquo;all the lights go on by themselves, darkness like a dark bird, flies away,&rdquo; because there can be no wrong thinking in the Christ Consciousness no more, it is all light. Jesus said when He was on the earth plane, &ldquo;If thine eyes be single visioned, the body is full of light,&rdquo; therefore this is the Christ Center, this is the door Trikuti and all these things means the same thing, the door of the inner consciousness begins now and &ldquo;darkness like a dark bird, flies away, flies away.&rdquo; 1:10 How much these Souls traveling through this fourth Bardo will gather of the Christ Light, this is what they will able to take in their next incarnation. You see their consciousness may have shut out much of the light in ignorance which we call sin or some people call sin that is ignoring the laws of nature, now they&rsquo;ve come back to the light and the light is like a man living in a darkness, cannot stand too much of it exposed right away so he can only take so much of the exposure of the Christ life. Well I will chant and you can join me and it&rsquo;s very simple verses. (All chanting several times) &ldquo;Who is in my temple, who is in my temple. All the doors do open themselves, all the lights do light themselves. Darkness like a dark bird, flies away, O flies away. Darkness like a dark bird, flies away, O flies away.&rdquo; Om, Christ, Gurus. Still keeping your mind on the blue light of the Christ Consciousness helping those on the fourth Bardo whatever they may gather will help them on their new rebirth and as you keep your mind and I read the words of the fourth Bardo. &ldquo;I have bled for Thy name and for Thy name&rsquo;s sake I am willing ever to bleed like a mighty warrior with gory limbs, injured body, wounded honor, and the thorn crown of the regime. Undismayed I fight on, my scars I wear as roses of courage, of inspiration to persevere in the battle against evil. I may continue to suffer blows on my arms outstretched to help others and receive persecution instead of love but my Soul shall ever bask in the sunshine of thy blessings. O Lord Thou dost guide thy soldier campaigns that conquer for Thee the lands of human hearts now oppressed by sadness. With the transfiguring sword of wisdom, I smite the error full, my army of freedom thoughts is disciplined by the divine martinet, single-hearted devotion to thee. Blowing trumpets of Thy liberating name, the battalions march into enemy occupied territory, maya deluded minds, and may the legions of light vanish the despot called darkness, usurper in Man&rsquo;s kingdom of consciousness. Oh in my invasions of the continents of ignorance, Thou hast and will ever be my divine commander-in-chief. Om, Christ, Gurus. Keeping your mind on the blue light of Christ Consciousness entering the room, filling it all with each one of us, filling all those who are in the fourth Bardo and like the thief on the cross whose last plea is, &ldquo;Master remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.&rdquo; For with this one last plea, the Soul traveling through the Bardo can be lifted up and the Master replied to the thief on the cross, &ldquo;Verily I say unto thee on this day thou shalt be with Me in paradise.&rdquo; All souls can be lifted up if we will only be humble and ask remembrance to Master Consciousness in ourselves, the Christ Conscious in our own self. Enveloping those Souls in the blue light if they will only realize that they can liberate themselves from reincarnation now and ever be free, then we have done them a divine service lifting them up through that Bardo. 1:20 The is the Bardo of the hearing and the seeing and of the living and those who have passed on for the invisible realms. It is the Bardo that helps both the living, not only those who have passed on, it is for the living mostly. When we can all be like the thief on the cross, come back to our own Master Consciousness within ourselves and say, &ldquo;remember me,&rdquo; but as we let go of our five senses and our associations, return back to our inner self, we would be lifted up into the Divine Light of Divine Christ Consciousness just as those Souls traveling through the fourth Bardo can be liberated now and I have their divine salvation here and now through the aid of those who are praying for them to pass through their travels and to recognize the way out of lower forms of rebirth. Beloved Jesus, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, our beloved Guru Paramahansaji, Thy blessings are with us in this Christ Conscious state. We lend our spiritual powers to be used to help those on the Bardo and may their consciousness be ever lifted up and may thy blessings pour upon us and upon this household and to all our friends in the living world. Still holding on to the blue light of the Christ Consciousness in yourself and all around you, let us raise our hands above our heads and chant Om seven times. (Chanting Om). Thank you, you can lower your hands. Still holding on to the blue light, feeling the Christ Consciousness all around us, radiating it out from the heart, let us slowly open our eyes. This ends the fourth Bardo. The fifth Bardo is the most important of them all, the clear white light which the Soul goes back into and there is no loss of individuality in the clear white light, it is a regaining of self, the cosmic self, because we cannot lose individuality. We may lose ego association with the body but not the Divine individuality that is consciousness. When the Soul goes back into the white light and regains itself, it will recognize the Divine &ldquo;I&rdquo; and it would see itself in all things but that for that brief moment it returns, we in the living can experience it more than those who are going through that trial by living in our conscious Now. We must empty our minds of past and we must empty our minds of future as we start the fifth Bardo or the final Bardo for them. God exists now, He does not exist yesterday or tomorrow because existence is Now. Where would the existence be? Think for one moment you exist and existence is Now and only because consciousness exists now can you sense your nowness and you are one with everybody now. The moment your mind drifts away, it will be like that water shaking in the glass from past to future. When you synchronize your consciousness to Now, past and future become Now. In the Now you are free from the physical body, the astral body, and the causal body, you are One, you are Soul now. It is only now in the nowness of your being can you experience the white light. Many of us may experience it and many have experienced it before, many are experienced by their meditation, but it is only true now, no holding on to the Now and in the Bardo of the nowness, the fifth Bardo, this can be your divine experience of yourself. 1:30 Those who are going to go through the Bardo will be helped by the Masters to experience the nowness of themselves and when they experience the light, how much they will hold of that light and you&rsquo;ll find how much you can hold on to the nowness of your consciousness and it may not be more than five minutes or five seconds depending on how strong you bring your conscience but you have the advantage over those who&rsquo;ve passed over that you&rsquo;re in the body and can repeat the process as long as you&rsquo;re in the physical frame. When you&rsquo;re out of the physical frame, the process is a one-shot exposure and you go back to the level where you supposed to prepare yourself for reincarnation. In the physical body the only disadvantage is you going to sleep at night or you decide not to wake up next morning, see this is the one disadvantage of the nowness. Now in the nowness of your being there is no more unconsciousness and you&rsquo;ll find as you go through the years of uncovering yourself, the higher self, then sleep would be in a state of unconscious sleep which you experience now, but in those years to come would be in a state of consciousness. There would be no break between the full consciousness and your consciousness in that state of now-ness, your body will sleep and get the normal sleep with everything yet consciousness will not be broken, you will not lose this conscious identity, you will for have the fulfillment in your life that the consciousness is there. The only reason why we are afraid of the death process, as Jesus and the Masters called the sleep process, is a loss of our awareness which you call identity but there is no loss in the now-ness of yourself and this is the cosmic self that you have to live it. In the body it is possible now to make this daily activity, that you are now not yesterday and not tomorrow, you don&rsquo;t think of the meal you eat because that (inaudible), it&rsquo;s now and more you hold on to Now and try to be conscious of the body with this flowing force, then you will find this ecstasy comes down, this bliss comes down, you&rsquo;ve been flooded with it, you call it grace, a flood of joy passing through your body. Every moment you can have it, you can have it 24 hours a day in waking, sleeping, divinely loving, meditating, chanting, it&rsquo;s flowing through you all the time and even when you leave the body it is still there. It&rsquo;s eternal Now, not eternal yesterday or eternal tomorrow, it&rsquo;s eternal now in this consciousness Now and we think of the white light and the white light is devoid of any form because it will break itself up into seven forms or seven expressions. So we don&rsquo;t think of the expression of light, we think of the pure white light and we put our consciousness in it. Now to start the last Bardo, we do a Kriya again because the Creator is the Master Consciousness (gap in tape)&hellip; polestar of my life and I&rsquo;ll go over the words because the cosmic star or the third eye is the white star, the pranic star, which is the dove that descended onto Jesus which is upside down. It&rsquo;s a five-pointed star representing earth, water, fire, air, ether. These are the forces we go back to in ourselves and the different astral realms are built up of it, we have to pass through them but with the aid of Masters who we are acquainted with in the physical plane we can do it faster and we can also help those who have never had any spiritual help before, we can by proxy help these people to have a better rebirth. At the same time we are having a rebirth of ego and consciousness right now, our own self is going through a Bardo, we are passing through these Bardos with ourselves, so we are being lifted up. We may not see many things in relation to ourselves right away but don&rsquo;t worry the grace and the divine presence will flow in to convince you that you&rsquo;ve had your upliftment. (All chanting 5 times). &ldquo;I have made thee polestar of my life, I have made thee polestar of my life. Though my sea is dark and my stars are gone, though my sea is dark and my stars are gone. Still I see the path through thy mercy, still I see the path through thy mercy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Om.&rdquo; Let us chant one more, &ldquo;Thou art my life.&rdquo; 1:40 (All chanting 5 times) &ldquo;Thou art my life, Thou art my love, Thou art the sweetness which I do seek. Thou art my life, Thou art my love, Thou art the sweetness which I do seek. In the thought by my love brought, in the thought by my love brought, I taste Thy name, so sweet, so sweet. Devotee knows how sweet you are, devotee knows how sweet you are. He knows whom you let knows, he knows whom you let knows.&rdquo; Om, Christ, Gurus. Trying to hold on to Now and the consciousness of the white light and I will read the last Bardo. &ldquo;Oh Divine Kali, Mother Nature, I bow to Thee, all sheltering Mother Nature, ruler of time, space, form, and relativity. Invisible spirit took shape in Thee, a visible Cosmic Mother. The beauty spot of the moon is set between Thy spacious eyebrows by cosmic crescent is the divine womb in which all things return. Clouds of eternity hide Thy face, gusts of prophet lives blow aside momentarily by mystery veil revealing to Mankind glimpses of Thine ineffable beauty. The countless worlds delineate Thy form. (Inaudible) moon garland, infinite in adornments and glories, in Thy changing robes are woven the dreams of creation, preservation, and reconstruction. On this endless etheric curtain of Thy mind, a myriad cosmic dramas play. Thou dost entertain Thy good children and frighten Thy naughty ones. O Divine Kali, Mother Nature primordial, from Thy hand of creative power issue the vibrations of Om, materializing in an exhaustible, bewildering, and wondrous variety of finite forms and yet another hand holds the astral sword of preservation, keeping guard over planetary rhythms and balances. Thy third hand clutches the severed head of the cosmos, symbolizing the annihilation in Brahma&rsquo;s Night the darkness of consciousness, with the white light it is devoured, and in the fourth hand it stills a storm of delusion and bestows on our devotees Thy rays of salvation. Thou thus project the fabulous dream fiestas of the centuries, the pageant of human life and death, the birth and the passing of civilizations and the evolution and dissolution of solar systems. O Earth Thou art eternally present in the slums of misery, the halls of festive prosperity, and quiet shrines of wisdom. O Pristine Mother in the cyclic dawn of creation I beheld Thee crowned with vile nature wearing the skunt garment of primitive cultures and roving amidst the unpolished minds. In the noon day of creation, I saw Thee in full activity, Thy vast body perspired as though unseen, it&rsquo;s accomplish the tasks set by the restless ambitions of the cosmic children. They felt the strain of struggle, scorched by their own ego blazes, Men implored Thee to send cooling breezes of Soul peace through the divine meditation. The night of total destruction approaches, I beheld Thee covered ominously with morning wails. Thou didst plunge the universe into terrible but purifying ordeal by fire, the white light dissolves all things. The sun burst belching smoke and flames, doomful quakes sunder the skies and conflagrated the stars. Worlds vanish within Thy crucible, matter becomes pure and luminous, the wide and white light. The phenomenal spheres, they came from light and slept as astral embers then stirred by Thee, O Perennial Mother, the universe reawakens in its vibrational body of subtle flames and white light and these flames do leap out into an unmanifested infinite, hidden beneath the magic shroud of relativity whilst Thou O Exuberant Goddess of Forms whirl in fantastic dances of planitude, Thy wild steps cease only when Thy feet touched the transcendent breast of Thy Divine Consort Shiva, Lord of Reconstruction, in whom all re-creation and recreation and creation comes to rest. Everywhere O Kali, Divine Mother Nature, I hear Thy voice resounding as the cosmic Om. 1:50 In the thunder, in the singing, in the softly flow and flux of atoms I hear Thee, in the symphony of spinning stars, I hear Thee and in twinkling and tinkling of lights and bells, laughing and harmonious lives, Thou art nearer to me than the throbs of my own heart and I perceive Thee on the farthest horizon of consciousness, the Divine Cosmic White Light within my own consciousness and around me like fireflies, everything dancing in Divine Light, Thou has become me. O Dancer of an Unsearchable Nature, thy entrancing footsteps echo all over my Soul. Om, Christ, Gurus. Holding on to that white light we&rsquo;re entering the Cosmic Consciousness and as we hold on to the consciousness of Now, all our senses are withdrawn into the altar of the spine and right up to the top of the skull and there those who are in the fifth Bardo can see their own thousand petal lotus and see the light opening it. We in the physical frame can experience the bliss because God is the ever-new joy and the consciousness of Now. May all Souls returning back to the cosmic light realize that they have not lost but gained their truer self and all their fears of attachment and fears of unconsciousness are being dissolved and may they have the full consciousness of the Nowness of Being and if their reincarnation should be of a higher nature, may they learn the lesson of applying it in their spiritual lives. Divine Mother teach us to live more and more by direct cosmic energy and less and less on these solids and liquids (inaudible) as our Divine Consciousness is fed by direct cosmic energy through the medulla oblongata. As we enter that Bardo of the white light, not depending on physical substances to sustain us, may we in the body have this rebirth of consciousness and be able to live by direct cosmic energy and less from the solids and liquids. May our bodies be rejuvenated, revitalized, and regenerated, and may be utilized in such a way to be a child for Divine Energy, Divine Light. Let us never stray from the consciousness of Now that we are the eternal self, the eternal conscious life, Soul. Beloved Gurus, may Thy blessings flow to each one of us in the room, opening up their spiritual life, spiritual centers, may the love (inaudible) and flow out from their hearts to those on the fifth Bardo be one of joy, we give thanks. Let us raise our hands and chant Om seven times. (All chanting Om seven times.) Still holding on to the white light and holding on to consciousness of Now, our own ego loss occurs also but we also gain ourself, the self of is-ness, of being, the oneness and the unity of all life around us flowing. Holding onto the consciousness of Now, don&rsquo;t let the mind drift into the past or into the future, thus we help those on the fifth Bardo and thus we are helped by the Masters in our own private development. (Meditation.) Now in the white light let your mind dwell on the crescent on the table and draw the power from the crescent into your own consciousness, feeling the white light sending the power to you from the crescent, the Divine Conscious Light, drawing it through the forehead or reach out your hands and draw the current from the crescent. Whatever way you want to draw the white light to you for healing, for abundance, for your family, your friends in the earth plane in this physical life, for your own spiritual upliftment. We are all linked with all those who are in attunement, not only in this room but within many places in this globe and in other planets and many astral realms, this inner white light is flowing as we link ourselves with it. We can feel it passing through our bodies especially through the forehead, through the fingertips. As you draw it to yourself and if you feel to radiate it to someone in the room do so but it is building to all your friends, do so. If you feel inclined to radiate the entire mineral kingdom, do so, or the entire vegetable kingdom, the entire animal kingdom, the entire human kingdom, or the entire spiritual kingdom of the Masters and those who are passing through the different Bardos awaiting rebirth or resurrecting and our own cosmic self present in our hearts. Thank you. Slowly open your eyes and try to hold on to the peace. The ends the fifth Bardo and we will chant the rose petals song of the Kriya by proxy. You just repeat after me, &ldquo;roses to the left, roses to the right, roses front and behind, roses, roses.&rdquo; Thank you. Audience: Thank you!</p>
<h2 id="1965---volume-1-i-am-soul">1965 - Volume 1 I Am Soul</h2>
<p>Adano65_Vol1_IamSoulQ1RRNW6 - Audience: Adano Ley is a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda whose picture is here. Yogananda is the founder of the Self-Realization Fellowship in California. Adano Ley has been a student of not only Yogananda for many years but also of all forms of what should we call it? Occultism, religious what-not, as are many of the people here. We&rsquo;re all grateful to have him come through Dallas, he&rsquo;s a businessman, he&rsquo;s on business, he&rsquo;s not here on the lecture tour. Whenever he comes through Dallas he&rsquo;s always glad to stop here or somewhere (inaudible) with some of his friends in Dallas. I don&rsquo;t know that he has any particular subject tonight, he will be glad to answer questions later on. He also will try to draw as he can on any questions that you may have so I&rsquo;ll turn the meeting over to Mr. Ley. Adano: Thank you Paul, thank you. It&rsquo;s always nice to see you beautiful, wonderful, radiant people again, it&rsquo;s always good to come to Dallas. As Mr. Baurice mentioned I&rsquo;m only a disciple and that disciple is one who has decided a long time back when he came to the wonderful realization that he&rsquo;s pretty stupid. He doesn&rsquo;t know his way out how to behave among his fellow man, that was me and is me. I&rsquo;m seeking as a disciple does to discipline the whole structure of my nature to the one reality and that one reality is, &ldquo;I am Soul,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have a Soul. This may come as a strange statement to many people but to those who have diligently searched the truth in all scriptures and scientific investigation of life, will realize that Man is Soul and the testimony lies in those Masters or human beings who have achieved this in their own life and have demonstrated it and worked with Man to realize it. It takes us very close sometimes, very frustrating and sometimes very aggravating to the point that we have to be interested in ourselves, you know this is something modern Man is not interested in. Why does the human being want to discipline himself? You have parents, they should be able to discipline you from your childhood, they should make you go to school and obey a teacher, you should go out in the adult world and follow the disciplines of society but why would the human being want to impose even stricter discipline on his life. There are reasons, very valid reasons for it and from these valid reasons we come in contact with the study of our emotional nature and the problems involved with our emotional nature. I said before that Man is Soul, he does not have a Soul, and I seek as a disciple to this realization of it. One would say then that I&rsquo;m a religious fanatic or one may say, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re crazy,&rdquo; or whatever one will call it that&rsquo;s their prerogative but just for one brief moment if we can validate that statement as a reference point to what I am trying to discover or accomplish, I must take some religious texts and use it as a reference point for my study and discipline. In the book of Genesis in the Christian bible or Judeo-Christian bible, it states that &ldquo;the Creator made Man in His own image and likeness, male and female created them and breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; It did not state that Man became a living body. Now this is on record. It does not state at any time Man became a living Soul, if this is on record and if this has been the cause of many pages of history and bloodshed because of the conflict between having one and not having one or being one then in the process of time within this life stream of mine I realize I am confronted with a truth about myself which I must achieve irregardless of how the conditions in the world are existing and if I achieve this understanding it is possible for those who are struggling with the confusion concerning the idea of having a Soul or not having a Soul or being a Soul, it&rsquo;s possible that we can bridge a gap of communication and have some interfaith communion with each other. How would one go about trying to discover that he is Soul, this is quite a challenge. They have many references and many living testimony in human body as to the approach and that is where the living teacher or teachers, Masters, become important or Saviors, the founders of what religions that exist today. In my search I have placed the mechanism under certain disciplines handed down by the Master Paramahansa Yogananda because He communicated those disciplines to my frame of reference as the most scientifically verifiable way that I have been able to test them scientifically, not that there is no other frame of reference for them in your own consciousness. In my work I have to be scientific, I cannot tell a scientist that I believe in a God and tell him that I have to rely on the faith to move that chair over there, I have to give him a demonstrable relationship. So in my own makeup I&rsquo;m seeking the realization from a certain reference point but this reference point envelopes every other reference point because it&rsquo;s reality, there is the reference point of love and devotion as much as the reference points of knowledge, logic, reason, and intuition but to put myself in a state of discipline I&rsquo;m confronted with my emotional nature, my needs, my wants, my desires, society, and this is a struggle. 0:10 The struggle is that when we are not informed as to what goes on within our own emotional nature, we jump to hasty conclusions concerning the outcome of these conditions in our lives and we automatically pose as an authority on these conclusions, only to discover that these are theories to become obsolete at some other future time, strange, and we keep searching to sift out, finding methods to work on this emotional nature. The scriptures have been a sort of a reference manual for Man to look into the emotional nature and living Teachers have been the disciplinarians to maintain control on the emotional nature, but the greatest disciplinarian is each one of us, ourselves, we ourselves maintain the discipline by our own personal effort, no one can do the discipline for us and this is pretty hard to accept when so much emotion, interchange of play of life, is going on around us, our needs, our wants, frustrations, aggregations. So normally if we attempt to impose a restriction on this emotional nature to prevent it from becoming too involved since we want to follow discipline, we end up being more frustrated, more aggravated, in fact you wish you have never started to discipline yourself, everything that you intend to do start crumbling. Anytime you come exposed to some real truth and what you thought was truth and you automatically discover you had wished you had never got involved because at one moment you seem to be traveling on a beautiful plane of thought, everything is working fine you can adjust this emotional nature, then all of a sudden you find downhill you go. Another moment you find in that downhill moment there is frustration, there is lag, boredom, there seems to be no outlet, everything seems to be closing in on the person. But the disciple, and as I said I have to refer to myself as a disciple, I am not the Master because mastery is something I have to achieve. As a disciple, disciplining this entire mechanism and directing it to its true creative source, God, I too would admit I would rather jump over a cliff than attempt the disciplines because they are too harsh at times, when they became obvious what one would have to surrender, and yet because it was not a form of suppression, I realized the value of the discipline on my emotional nature. If I did not realize that these were not actual suppressions on this emotional nature of mine, the consciousness would have gone into a negative tone or a negative attitude of existence and destroyed itself, but I realize that the discipline is an art of reducing the outward flow of the desire pattern through the senses, through the mechanics of my body, to cope with the environment in which I live in. If it were not this principle of reducing and turning on and raising it and lowering it at certain times when it was necessary, the road of discipline would be impractical, near impossible for the individual to follow, but we don&rsquo;t get the disciplines that ruin the mechanism. No discipline is imposed by scriptural truth that would ruin this mechanism because this mechanism when created was created for a particular purpose. As I said before it&rsquo;s stated in the scriptures that Man became a Living Soul, Man did not became a living body, yet he seems to be imprisoned in a form called body, that is so far he seems to be imprisoned in. It&rsquo;s the realization that this form contains the qualities of Soul that spurs with the cycle to make that effort. We should not try to suppress our emotional nature to discipline our lives and call it discipline, we should try to understand our emotional nature. The only way we can understand our emotional nature is to take those very codes that have been handed down to us in various religions and see their influence on our behavior and those very codes that have become legislation in our convention that holds us in a psychological pen for us to move in our assembly line existence. It is this we have to review and evaluate to see it before we can say we are willing to accept the disciplines of Spirit. A disciple&rsquo;s greatest desire is the God Realization and the knowledge that he is Soul and greater than that is the universal desire of God to see the creation unfolding as Soul. You see this is what makes for the presence of Living Masters on the earth plane, They are the unfolding, They are here demonstrate the reality of self. We need guidance though and as I said before Teachers, Masters, are here and we have to seek Them out, but even when we seek them out we are confronted with the one truth, discipline, discipline of this emotional nature, a tremendous need for it, a tremendous understanding of it. Now in this discipline when you really understand how it functions, you will see it&rsquo;s freedom, it&rsquo;s not an imposition or a restriction to your real nature, in fact it&rsquo;s the first time you can regulate the flow of consciousness through this mechanism called the body, it&rsquo;s the first time you can really merge in that delightful fundamental of peace and know it exist because from it everything seems to flow like like light, it&rsquo;s vibrating, it&rsquo;s the consciousness that works for you now to work in this material world totally creative for the first time, unhampered with animosities, unhampered with prejudices, unhampered of any type of psychological hang-ups. 0:20 It is that what you&rsquo;re striving for in your discipline, the inner contact of this inner flow where this vital power flows from within you. That particular accomplishment through the discipline has been described or stated in one scripture as &ldquo;Seek ye first the Kingdom of God which is within you and all these things are added unto you,&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s a word left out and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; which means &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s right activity,&rdquo; how it&rsquo;s linked up in a mechanism. Also it is a tremendous re-evaluation of your attitude, this is not an overnight process and it demands patience because you&rsquo;re dealing with a very subtle function and substance, you&rsquo;re dealing with flesh that is your own body form and you&rsquo;re dealing with conventional ideas, you&rsquo;re dealing with desire patterns, and you&rsquo;re dealing with survival at the same time. So all these things tend to press in on your existence and tend to press in on a desire to discipline yourself, but if you know the motive and if you know the goal and the results from that goal, then if the individual wants this realization, the price is not much to pay to the true devotee or the true disciple but the price would be a big one to pay for the disciple who does not want it. Now I am not telling you tonight that you have to discipline yourself, far from me to go and tell you how you should discipline yourself, because I&rsquo;m pointing out what you would discover you need to do on your own within yourself. You would see the measurement through which you can evaluate your own emotional nature, you yourself will know the right time from within yourself when it&rsquo;s ready for you to make these decisions. For someone to come along and impose it upon you this is not discipline, this is psychological enslavement, but when you through a voluntary effort evaluate your emotional nature, then you would discover the right time to make this bridge of disciplining the self. Normally in ancient time the techniques employed to discipline the emotional nature: one - the monastic life, two - the crusadic type of life or missionary type of life, three - the hermit type of life, not living in a monastery but living totally withdrawn to yourself but finally you discovered that these three are inadequate because we can&rsquo;t all be monks or hermits, we can&rsquo;t all be marching on crusades. So we have to live in the world in various cultures, various civilizations, political environment, and learn now the art of disciplining this emotional nature to the reality of life around it, this is the challenge, this is a greater challenge. It is to be able to get up to go to work and know that you have to sit down with for a few moments of self analysis, it is to know that in brief moments instead of getting over angry at certain things, to re-analyze how the flow of energy is causing this aggravation within you, it&rsquo;s a re-evaluation of living habits, this is greater discipline because this takes in now a great deal of self-analysis. Through the help of Masters They tell you &ldquo;do this, do that&rdquo; and you follow. Many of us may not be fortunate to encounter a physical Master, what are we supposed to do? In the meantime we can learn to evaluate this mechanism, we can then try to understand the inner disciplines that go with it and try to apply them gradually to our daily lives. In time you may be exposed to some disciple of some great Teacher who may point out certain techniques of how to cope with the emotional nature, how to turn it on, turn it off, and thereby lead you to a fully illumined Master who will lift you out into that dimension of understanding but in the meantime the journey via that existence is a wonderful one. It&rsquo;s a journey of joy, it&rsquo;s a journey of peace because it brings with it many understandings concerning the weaknesses of your emotional nature and the strengths of your emotional nature and the greatest joy as an American can have is the do-it-yourself joy, just do it yourself disciplining himself, like you do it yourself build a house or do it yourself surgery. Well this is great joy but not only for the American this is for Man. Man is happy or even happier in his true nature to be afforded an opportunity to do the thing himself, only with a supervisionary council on this side pointing out, that&rsquo;s where the Masters come more important now. You do it yourself and the Masters are supervising and bringing on the workload they are giving you the workload now. As you handle the workload of self-discipline and as the strengths and the flexibility of your mind adjusts to environment and its different inter-reactions, sooner or later you start to experience this peace, a peace that doesn&rsquo;t go away anymore, it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s coming on all the time. In fact it gets to a point where it can seem you lose all association but this is rare at times, the important thing about the peace that comes is that you are able to work in the environment on the problems that the environment present without causing the nervous system to heat up. 0:30 Now I said heat up, when you&rsquo;re angry or you&rsquo;re in a state of emotional stress, this body heats up and when you are recollective, pensive, in a state of deep meditation or concentration, the body cools down. It&rsquo;s very important to realize, there&rsquo;s an old saying, &ldquo;Keep a cool head my son, you&rsquo;ll make the grade, don&rsquo;t be a hot head.&rdquo; Even in these little statements we start to see a emotional principle demonstrated to us. Disciplining the mechanism is watching its interaction, that doesn&rsquo;t say you don&rsquo;t do anything in fact it&rsquo;s the most demanding type of work. It&rsquo;s such a demanding type of work and workload to discipline a mechanism that vibrates and is involved through the five senses with an environment that is constantly enticing it, attracting it, and demanding the utmost of it. Some of the attractions is &ldquo;keeping up with the Joneses,&rdquo; some of the attractions is to outdo each other, some of the attractions is the over interplay of ideas, and finally combating with ideas to the extent we end up combating with physical effort. When we discipline our emotional nature, one of the first things a disciple is told by his spiritual guide or teacher, Master, is to meditate. Now this is not so easy because this is very demanding at times, you may not have enough spare moment, as you would say, in the daily routine of your existence to want to meditate, but as a disciple this is the workload demanded by the disciple for the disciple, this is the workload the teacher has laid out and the disciple has to work upon his body which is the only instrument he&rsquo;s got and it&rsquo;s like a car at the same time and on the road of life there is no u-turn between birth and death and there is no trade-in or no exchange parts. You cannot exchange your brain, you can&rsquo;t exchange the body in for another body, which you have to go through from birth to death, you cannot turn back and say &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m age 14, I want to go back to age 2 and start all over again.&rdquo; This is going in one direction, forward all the time, and the emotional nature is accumulating drives all the time. So wherever we come in on the exposure to a personal self-discipline of this emotional nature to realize that we are Soul, there the workload begins. Now Jesus as a Master in His time left a certain reference manual for a workload and it was called the be-attitudes the attitudes of behavior. I think there were about 12 of them and this is quite a workload to impose or adapt and regulate one central and sympathetic nervous system too. That is to say live in accordance not from the mere physical sense of it or the psychological sense, from the deep profound interlocking principles of it that&rsquo;s going on in oneself. That&rsquo;s quite a challenge yet He left a technique to start the process of the workload, to go about this workload, He left the technique and it&rsquo;s that technique that the disciple holds on to or that jewel or rare treasure or rare gift a disciple holds on to and that is the reference point whereby the workload begins. In Jesus time the reference point was He once said, &ldquo;If thine eyes be single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; The reference point then would have to be somewhere where you can singly focus these two eyes and look inward and throughout the ages it has been discovered in every religious environment that Man turned inward to meditate, that was inward focusing. So this discovery to look in becomes the gift and at the same time it&rsquo;s the spade to do the spade work and turning in to meditate starts the entire disciplining of this whole mechanism because from that you begin to find certain things that you want to do or you wish to do after a period they seem to lose significance or value, they fall apart without any effort on yours. In the early stages it&rsquo;s difficult to see that because you want to be very exact, you want to follow it to the letter of the law and thereby ruining the physical health, thereby disturbing the mechanism, but if you are adjusting gradually to the pull of environment and regulating the various attitudes that are involved, then you will notice that this discipline becomes very easy and that meditation becomes a very simple thing after all. It becomes so easy to meditate and the fruit of meditation comes out, the fruit of this meditation in the early stages is peace profound, but in the advanced stages of meditation finally it is the realization you&rsquo;re Soul, but you have to do the spade work. As Mr. Baurice mentioned I am a disciple and that&rsquo;s all I pretend to work out in this mechanism, disciplining this mechanism. Tonight if those who are interested to go into meditation and discover for themselves their own workload, join me and if you&rsquo;re not interested as soon as we&rsquo;re over the meditation you can shoot your answers, you have a chance to fire all the questions you want. Now meditation is only on one objective all the time and that is conscious unity with God, it&rsquo;s not an unconscious approach, it&rsquo;s not a wishful approach, it is a conscious approach and this unity is something that each one has to discover through his own effort, there is no other way. 0:40 Why? As Jesus would put it in the metaphysical phraseology, &ldquo;None cometh to the Father but by Me.&rdquo; None in no human consciousness involved through the five senses in the physical world can withdraw itself into total awareness or God awareness except it goes inward into the Christ self or intuitive self of Man. How is it possible, there is no road back except through this particular condition and Jesus being a living example of an intuitive life, fully, profound, is demonstrating laws of behavior and techniques of discipline of the emotional nature to the world that Man is Soul and Man has to slowly go back through that technique from the idea that he has a Soul or he does not have a Soul or maybe he is Soul, these are all the conditions he may think he is, to find out for sure that he is Soul and the workload begins inside. Now meditation is one step further than prayer, that doesn&rsquo;t say Man does not pray, and I don&rsquo;t want you to go away the idea that this is going to detract from a religious involvement of your life that you pray, far from it. I&rsquo;m only trying to point out that by the meditative process of disciplining the emotional nature you will really know how to pray for the first time and discover that prayer is a means of communing with the higher self. In the meditation you&rsquo;re asked to just close the eyes but don&rsquo;t fall asleep and try to keep the spine straight and don&rsquo;t strain, be as comfortable as possible, because this entails conscious effort and the conscious effort is disciplined. Now the vital energy flows through the vital nerves and through the five senses into the physical organs and you are involved with the outside world through the senses of seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, and touch. Now and everything involved in that outward realm is retained in the brain as language and the association through language. In the meditative principle or discipline we will shut down one of the avenues that is the lids of the eyes, vision, and through this shutdown attitude, discipline of sight begins. (Meditation) While we close the eyes and look within and not falling asleep, we have a sense or a tendency to become more aware of our existence thus a stepping up of your inner consciousness and you begin to realize that the sense of hearing is taking over more. The sense of smell, sense of taste and touch are also becoming acute to the extent that they&rsquo;re becoming extra perceptive and as we gaze at the point between the eyebrows with our eyes closed, keeping the mind there, gradually we will see a light or a radiance, a luminescence. Now the mind has a tendency to drift only because it was involved with the external realm and this is a form of discipline by trying to observe what the mind is latching on to, what particular idea or word or association or thought or experience the mind is latching onto and through this conscious observation or conscious discipline, the mind sometimes recognize an idea or a thought creeping up from the past, some past experience. Now if it&rsquo;s associating with that experience eventually the emotional nature will become frustrated. If the mind is latching on to something concerning the future sooner or later the emotional nature will end up in anxiety. Now if the mind is involved in the present, now, what it&rsquo;s actually doing in relation to the body, then the sense of breathing, the function of breathing, begins to slow down. In the scriptures it was said, &ldquo;God breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; At this very moment in the present Now as the consciousness identifies itself with the present and the slowing down rate of inhalation and exhalation, Man is given an opportunity to experience his Soul awareness. The Soul partaking of the qualities of the Divine exhibits omnipresence that it seems to reach out and be present everywhere in consciousness, it seems to radiate into unlimited existence. 0:50 Here begins the devotional workload of communion with the universal spirit, God, ever conscious of the present Now. The vast ocean of peace and tranquility is all around you now in the form of consciousness and the personal discipline of watching, the personal vigil is the link up with that vastness of consciousness from within ourselves. Now slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move, try to hold on to the peaceful after effects but don&rsquo;t open the eyes too full, just partially, because through your self-observation there&rsquo;s a sensation of peace around you, in you, and coming through from within you, there is a reservoir of peace flowing out from within. Now with this partially open eyes we&rsquo;re gonna dive deeper back now into that vast ocean of consciousness again. So let us gradually close the eyes and go deeper in now into this deep ocean of consciousness of peace. Do not fall asleep, be conscious that you&rsquo;re applying personal effort, self-discipline, on your emotional nature, aligning yourself with God the Eternal Light within yourself. As the sense of hearing becomes more acute try to focus it on the right ear and try to listen to the audible life stream flowing in and out and around you, the Divine Cosmic Vibration of life passing in this physical form and right back into the atomic structure around us. Listening to the audible life stream we are escalated up into consciousness, into the consciousness of the Divine Nature. Listening with the right ear is disciplining the sense of hearing, you are disciplining the sense of hearing and directing it back to its source, the fountainhead whereby the vital current flows in the human mechanism. 1:00 Do not strain, be relaxed within yourself and be a total surrender to the Divine Presence, indwelling spirit, within us all. The internal self-surrender again is a discipline on the emotional nature. It&rsquo;s a discipline on the emotional nature to the presence of the Divine Life flowing in. Slowly open the eyes, not completely, half open, try to hold on to the peaceful effects of the environment. Gradually open the eyes wider and adjust to the light of the physical world but hold on to that inner attitude, try to see how long in the waking state you can maintain this inner attitude of calmness, try to see how long you can hold on to this inner strength that is flowing through the mechanism in the waking state. Now if you feel in the mood to dive back deeper in there, go right ahead. It is your own personal reservoir of divine peace, drink as much as you want, no one can cheat you of it now, it&rsquo;s your own portable paradise, you don&rsquo;t have to search for it, it has always been with us. You are not the same people anymore after this, you have found the source of your being. From this source you have to learn to live daily through personal effort of discipline. Thank you very much and if you want to shoot questions you&rsquo;re at liberty to go ahead and shoot them. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: We have to meditate in this environment in which we live in otherwise we will slowly disintegrate our entire emotional structure and become as brutes but meditation is your own do it yourself, tapping in to your Soul nature and the technique is simple, just dive in as much as you want, wherever you want, it&rsquo;s free has always been there for centuries, it&rsquo;s the fact that the Masters spread. They do not profess no organization, no other truth than light and sound and inward travel and as you progress you will in time be exposed to those living Masters but disciples come along and consider yourself disciples on the road of life. This is not a disciple that is an affiliation with an organization, this is a disciple who has found that God is the only true organization and He&rsquo;s all the universe and the body is an instrument to work with but the discipline that goes with it are simple yet very hard to make the adjustment if one is not aware of it. See we can read of it in the scriptures but we may not be able to recognize it to apply them and therefore we miss them. That&rsquo;s what makes it difficult and frustrating at times to realize that truth is that simple and the results are ever present all the time. Audience: (inaudible) something I found very interesting in reading not only theocracy but in the autobiography and that was the extreme age of some of the Masters particularly Babaji. I wonder if you could say a word about that and if it would be interesting to anyone. 1:10 Adano: Well it&rsquo;s&hellip; Audience: Something that&rsquo;s not readily acceptable for most people. Adano: I agree with you Paul, laboring under the illusion that I have a Soul, I can see the need even myself to want to calculate the age, chronological ages of Masteries of life but once one begins to realize that Man is Soul, chronological age don&rsquo;t really exist, it&rsquo;s physiological age that exists. You may be all physiologically old yet chronologically young and they are great Masters who are chronologically old and physiologically young, that is the truth. How to maintain physiology or physiological youth and carry on chronological age is the science of non-corruptibility or self-regeneration. One of the greatest teachings ever handed down by the Master Jesus, &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly,&rdquo; not mechanical objects, not material things, life more abundantly means an infusion of life force, divine energy, into the cellular structure hence the basis for physiological aging and physiological non-aging. Scientists in time will verify that as we studied it more, we have a poetical statement from the scriptures but in time it becomes scientific truth as we investigate into it more. It&rsquo;s hard I realize as a person who lives in this body form and labor under that illusion or concept, seeing so many dear ones passing on you know and the slow forces of aging, yet is not hard to conceive as far as the youth are concerned in the universities and the scientists are concerned, they don&rsquo;t see the impossibility of it, they see at the present the practical way of doing it yet the practical way has already been illustrated or demonstrated or given. So Man is never going to say he found something new when he stumbles across the truth because then he&rsquo;ll be fooling himself but the truth has always been there, long before and Masters will always come along to emphasize that one truth, They will be always living testimony of the one truth, that same one truth. We will always be reminded in our existence through the lives of Masters of the one truth, the one part of life which all Souls travel in. Audience: Adano do you think the time will ever come when people will take their bodies with them in golden disks. Adano: (Laughing). Audience: It is the subject of much debate you know. Adano: Well the age limit today hasn&rsquo;t increased according to our insurance statistics, is it not getting older and older chronologically but it&rsquo;s very seldom you see this statement, &ldquo;she has aged or he has aged gracefully and he looks like a young man of 35 with a 76 years of chronological background,&rdquo; or &ldquo;she looks like 35 with a 74-year background,&rdquo; rare specimens with tremendous buoyancy of light in their eyes and their walk and talk, a subtle law at work which they have hooked into, may not want to tell you, but they&rsquo;re aware of it at times or sometimes they are fortunate to have brushed against it but coming to moving off into space objects and so forth, this is another form of our planetary evolution, where are we to go next? You know if we don&rsquo;t dig up the earth and plow the seas, our next door neighbor the stars would be the next place Man has the wandering foot, the wanderlust is there because his Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t want to accept it, he still wants to think he&rsquo;s body. He has moments when he feels himself fleeing out of the body in dreams or in sleep or in trans or in ether or in some other process but these moments are the things that trigger that wanderlust, that that inventive nature, so our destiny is the stars. In other words one Master put it this way, &ldquo;we are coming there and they are coming here and everywhere we will go and come,&rdquo; so where do we have to go or where do we come from and who are we? Are we bodies or are we Soul? Is it not God who created the whole process and pointing it out in a physical way through physical laws and in a divine way through the unity of those laws in our behavior, in our emotional nature. Through the harmonizing of our emotional nature with those laws we will find the unity, so the scientist is coming to a deadlock with the priest. Now it&rsquo;s the bridging of the interfaith, the bridging of the scientific quest with the religious quest that the layman around is looking for, he&rsquo;s the one who is crowding now the situation, that is what is happening to us. We are seeking the fact that we are Soul but we are not ready to accept that &ldquo;Soul quest&rdquo; implies discipline. We are not ready to re-evaluate scriptural truth from that level. Master Jesus had 12 disciples and Master Yogananda had umpteen hundred, Master Kirpal Singh, Master Charan Singh, many other great Masters do have umpteen disciples. Apart from that, God the Creative Force has all the disciples, we are all disciples of God because we are the manifestation of that thing, this is this universal outlook, this universal perspective, we must realize where we are. So there is no fear of not going to the stars or working up in a sweat that it&rsquo;s possible or impossible. Audience: I was just wondering if perhaps there was a possibility that you before you kicked your frame or I before I kicked mine might alight upon the golden chariot. Adano: (Laughter) Well it would be quite presumptuous for me to assume the role of Elijah in a golden chariot and in fact where do I want to go? Do I want to go to another physical planet for the mere fact to exist to discover that I&rsquo;m Soul or do I want to achieve at this given moment with all my effort that I have Soul? Once free from the illusion, you are free, free men all Lord of yourself, &ldquo;He that overcometh I will not send for a second time,&rdquo; permanent, immutable beings in the law of light, where do we have to go? Go in the present, we can&rsquo;t go into the past, where is the past? The past is the stars out there, they&rsquo;ve be roving around out there for umpteen billions of years, across the universe. The present is here but we are also the past because we are moving too, we are moving along with them, celestial mechanics you see but the realization we want most of all is this awakening now that we are Soul. 1:20 Audience: I guess the reason I&rsquo;m asking you, I have a couple of friends insist that this must be (inaudible). Adano: This is a natural evolution. For those who are aware of astrology or an astrophysics and astronomy, they know that if we are in the aquarium age according to western way of describing this particular cycle of this particular solar system in relation to the universal zodiac, which space is involved with. In oriental philosophy or astrology it is known as the starting of the Doppara cycle, that we are in the mutation period from Karl Jog or the dark cycle of ignorance, the lack of information concerning the electrical structure of matter, and entering for the first time an understanding of the electrical nature of matter and in the Aquarian age, Aquarius is one of these symbols of astrology and it says to give the water carrier right, the man who is giving life or he&rsquo;s lifting the thing out in space. In other words they attempt to lift off from the earth is a cycle of evolution but this would be nothing new as far as Soul would be concerned, it&rsquo;d be something new as far as bodies are concerned&hellip; Audience: What are you going to with this body when you get it wherever you&rsquo;re going, it&rsquo;s made from the elements of this atmosphere, what are you going to do with it somewhere else? Adano: Well your scripture puts it the easy way to eliminate the problem, out of chemical dust as we want to say, out of dust you came and dust you go back, but what comes from dust and what goes back into dust, is it the vital power of life, God, or is it the body form that has crystallized itself? Is it the electrical nature that goes back to dust, the electrical nature of matter does that go back to dust? Is it the ideational nature of matter that goes back to dust or is it&hellip; Audience: You mean is this the idea that brought these particles together that might have formed? Adano: Does that go back to dust? Audience: The idea died. Adano: How? Audience: I say is that what you&rsquo;re saying, the idea died? Adano: No I&rsquo;m not saying that, I&rsquo;m asking which one of the three conditions go back to dust. Audience: Well I don&rsquo;t know, I would think that whatever held it was withdrawn or disengaged. Adano: But that&rsquo;s what you say when we die what are we going to do this body? The question is to ask yourself what dies, what eliminates itself from this physical form and where is that existing as to what you will do with that which you discard. Audience: I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t really know (inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s a part of evolution believe me, it&rsquo;s a part of evolution. Audience: (inaudible). The universe goes one way and we go another, don&rsquo;t we? Adano: Well the laws of centrifugal and centripetal flow or divine magnetism or divine love, it&rsquo;s the same thing. One has to go in on one direction, it&rsquo;s like orbiting two objects in space. Audience: So what do we have to do to reverse what we&rsquo;re doing to get&hellip; Adano: You mean from the emotional nature or from the physical&hellip; Audience: Whatever it is (inaudible). Adano: For us as we are concerned into the search of the Soul we are interested in the emotional nature and that is we are interested in slowing down the output of energy through the five senses and let it store itself up within the mechanism and revitalize that mechanism and to know that there is a source where this energy exists in as a reservoir, in other words this would be devotion. It&rsquo;s the opposite of emotional attitude, it&rsquo;s the opposite of going there, but here. Now that doesn&rsquo;t imply you don&rsquo;t do anything, a man can be highly devotional and fully involved with a large business cooperation entailing the livelihood of hundreds of people and responsibilities and not be a materialist and deeply devotional from this true spiritual nature. Yet a man can pretend to be devotional, has no responsibility, excludes himself from society, and really he only has false pride, he&rsquo;s more emotional than devotional, you see. So we&rsquo;re interested of slowing down the output, in other words instead of hurrying to do things externally and utilizing the energy and wasting it out through low emotional tones, we apply ourselves consciously in a semi effortless way to accomplish the thing but effort is applied just the same and with a certain intensity of alertness, not an intensity of nervousness. Audience: &ldquo;Be still and know that I am God.&rdquo; Adano: Right but these are the poetical illustrations of a certain internal gesture, a certain internal flow, that solves the problem now? You see I&rsquo;m in a hurry to pour all that stuff because these people are thirsty, that doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem either way, take your time and pour it, everybody will get some. In fact Jesus passed it for 40 days, that is a contradiction to the man who craves food you know. In other words if He could do for forty days, what about you for a few seconds, in other words you&rsquo;re shown up in your emotional nature, right away the thing shows you up. Audience: Is there a special way to meditate (inaudible). Adano: Within the brain there is enough energy in the form of matter that can light up in output according to scientific validity a 25 watt bulb, this constant output is going out through the brain and if hooked up would light up a 25 watt bulb. Now imagine that output of energy going on from a tissue like this and this has been demonstrated. Now the great Master Jesus said, &ldquo;If the eyes are single,&rdquo; focused you know turned in, &ldquo;the body is full of light.&rdquo; The great scientist Einstein said &ldquo;energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared.&rdquo; These two principles have bridged themselves for the first time, we recognize divine light as universal energy in a crystallized form and turning the eyes in as a simple technique in a bridging of the gap and this light that is present there comes forward. Now we recognize, &ldquo;the light shines in the darkness,&rdquo; that is this light is radiating or emanating in the uninformed consciousness and &ldquo;the darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; the uninformed consciousness comprehends it not because it may see it and think it&rsquo;s suffering from bad eyes, you see, &ldquo;but let that light so shine that the men may see the good work of self-discipline and glorify the cosmic self which is manifested.&rdquo; 1:30 You&rsquo;re seeing the thing as scientific truth for the first time and it&rsquo;s divine law which is religion in purest form, do you get the picture now? Audience: Someone told me it was very good to meditate on your body, the spirit within the body is golden light. Adano: It&rsquo;s good but let&rsquo;s take the the words of recognized Masters who have walked the path. You see walking the path of the Masters is far safer than the individual who comes along and tells you &ldquo;do this, do that.&rdquo; I have never read or encountered in the conversations of Masters that They tell you to go anywhere else than here and the effort is yours. They will speed you up if you need to be speeded up but They will allow you to crawl at your own speed too. They will never interfere if it&rsquo;s not necessary to interfere but They give you the reference point to work with, you follow me? Now a light is flowing, the current flowing in that bulb from a set of wires comes in from the meter but is pre-regulated by the switch, follow me? Now you can have a switch to this light here but you still have a reference point, it&rsquo;s a switch. The function of the switch is there as much as the function of the switch is there so there is a definite reference point in the human mechanism whereby we turn the light on and it&rsquo;s right here. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t there also a place right in the center? Adano: The place in the center is the bulb, that&rsquo;s the light you gotta turn on, that&rsquo;s where the light is, there is the reservoir of the light, that&rsquo;s where the light is existing. &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness,&rdquo; the light is shining or the cosmic energy is present in the brain of the uninformed man but the uninformed man, not looking in, cannot comprehend it when it&rsquo;s told to him, the uninformed man cannot comprehend it when he attempts it but this light is the only true witness of the Divine Light of which you are composed of. It&rsquo;s the only living, tangible thing portable to you or to me that I&rsquo;ve got that I&rsquo;m carrying my light in me, &ldquo;Let your light so shine before Man that they may see your good works,&rdquo; this light is in you, it is not in nobody else. Each one of us is linked up to that light and scientists are verifying this fact that Man is atomic matter but it&rsquo;s also already spirit, that it is divine nature. Now once you realize this, the only thing you want to do now is get in there and pitch, do the spade work, this is it the spade work of meditation. You don&rsquo;t need no books now, you need the encouragement, you need the encouragement to do the spade work, this is what we all lack or we don&rsquo;t seem to have enough of, the encouragement, you see. If you have the encouragement and that&rsquo;s where the origin of religious groups came, getting together in religious vigil, getting together to meditate, because Man is like the monkey you know, he loves to huddle together and religious huddling is a very good way to realize yourself, you get inside, any questions? Audience: The light is within, in the center of the brain for example is where the bulb would be, would this light come from deep within the own circumferene of your body or would it be something sort of transcendent, coming down? Adano: Well let&rsquo;s realize what we&rsquo;re saying you see. We use the word &ldquo;the light is within&rdquo; but this we&rsquo;re using it in a very limited realization. In its actual realization you are light slowed down in the form of matter, energy equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared. Audience: So this is actually light itself? Adano: It is congealed light appearing to the physical senses as matter, it&rsquo;s congealed sound appearing to the physical eyes, but it&rsquo;s congealed consciousness too, which is divinity which is up to us to recognize or awaken. That&rsquo;s why we say, &ldquo;God breathed into Man breath of life and Man became living Soul,&rdquo; not living body. So He&rsquo;s crystallized already but within this crystallized body there is a reference point and that reference point is what we&rsquo;re interested in, we&rsquo;re not interested in no other reference point, where to start. I don&rsquo;t say to look below here, I said look here, hence when you look here light will begin to come out and to listen here. Hence an escalation, that means a rise, I didn&rsquo;t say de-escalation, there is a rise in the higher frequencies now pulling you beyond into where that other level, you see? So light is already here around you but it&rsquo;s crystallized into this form. Now there is light waves in this room, you put on a TV set you&rsquo;ll pick it up, you put on a radio, it will pick it up, it&rsquo;s there but here is a manifestation of the greatest light wave, that&rsquo;s&hellip; Audience: your own body but does the light come down ever? Adano: Well you&rsquo;re asking a very&hellip; you are stating is to say that God is sitting somewhere up there right, is that possible when He&rsquo;s omnipresent, the word omnipresent don&rsquo;t indicate place or position, it indicates Being, self-evident process, slow down to become you. Therefore you have to unite yourself, that the word Yoga originated from, or unity or salvation or entering in oneness. You have to re-align yourself back, that is exactly what an atomic smasher does, it separates the mass back into its light, do you follow? Now meditation is one such atom smasher, that&rsquo;s actually what you&rsquo;re&hellip; the greatest atom smasher I know of, when saliva can take solid matter and convert it into energy, that is a fantastic atom smasher. You eat food, your saliva goes to work and start breaking down these forms of matter and dispersing it through mechanism to allow it to work and function, you see. Now what is implied is the the control of the emotional nature, this is what you want basically and the reference point and a reference manual to work with, all religious organizations from the founder of the religion who was the example, that Master only spoke one basic truth all the time, not two three, if you look into it you will see constantly it&rsquo;s the same thing He&rsquo;s saying, everyone is saying exactly the same thing, the language may differ a little due to the culture and due to the evolution of that culture but in an objective sense as a disciple of truth seeking to realize Man is Soul, he will see the interlocking of the faith, you will see science and religion merging, the crossroads are going away, it&rsquo;s one freeway into the other. It&rsquo;ll be like minus 435 fahrenheit where all the electrons flow, you know, are you very acquainted with the physics? Right they all become one, the electrical conductivity is there. 1:40 Audience: Could you say that for example your real self might be a body of life and that this body here would be maybe convinced a lower part of that real self and that your real self would be already purified body of light. Adano: Well let me put it another way so you can get a better picture what you&rsquo;re saying. Supposing I want to build a house, I would have to have the idea of a house right, first. I would have to think up the idea of a house, now that is one body form, the thinking process. Next I would like to put down that idea in a blueprint form so I will know what the measurements are in a sort of objective view of my idea and finally I am committed by financial means to build that house by hard labor where I will feel and react and may look at it as a disgrace of my clumsy architectural dreams or pride it as something most wonderful and praise it to the world but the end result is another body form. The end result may not be exactly as the schematic body form and the schematic body form may not be exactly as the idea body form but they are all light. Now in Man this process is exactly the same, he has a physical body form and he has an electrical body form and he has a idea body form, &ldquo;Come let us make Man in our own image and likeness, male and female create He them. The image would have to be the atomic mass slowed down and the likeness would have to be the omniscience which is already omnipresent, which is already omnipotent, and the Soul is the only living dynamo that has this quality, not body itself when you slow down, body when it&rsquo;s activated to realize it is Soul. When you realize that you are Soul this particular truth can be realized, that is what these Masters are talking of when They walk that path of truth, They are walking the path of the Audible Lifestream all the time, They&rsquo;re walking the path of inner light all the time. Now They don&rsquo;t try to tell you anything outside of &ldquo;sit down, meditate, go in explore,&rdquo; but They look at you and I as disciples of that path, of that truth, we seek to discipline ourselves with the universal truth. Now there&rsquo;s there is no conflict between one group and the other because it&rsquo;s one universal truth you see, there is no conflict. The conflict can only come not by the teachers of truth or the Masters of truth, the conflict can only come by the students of those Masters of truth. Each one would have certain idiosyncrasies from his culture, from his environment, civilization, and so forth language, custom, and so forth, there&rsquo;s certain idiosyncrasies, certain biases, certain prejudices. This can create the conflict but the truth will always be there between the Masters themselves, answer your question? Audience: Adano (inaudible) actually in a sense what you are saying it alleviates the dichotomy (inaudible), the body is participating in this energy even though it may be turned on but not realized. Adano: Yes. Audience: (inaudible) and through this process, meditation, the dichotomy is broken down (inaudible). Adano: I see your problem and this has always been the problem of the students or the disciples of all great Masters. If Masters never discard body to free Them from the personality complex, disciples would never make an effort on their own, they&rsquo;ll never be strong, they&rsquo;ll be weakened all their lives. They cannot walk on their own consciousness, they will never make the effort, they will constantly try to use that Master form as a rabbit foot for all their basic problems in the world and don&rsquo;t we do that today in our religious organizations, try to use it as a sort of &ldquo;genie in the lamp&rdquo; attitude of prayer and association. What I&rsquo;m trying to point out is this, Masters have a choice over the breakdown of the body cell and the regeneration of the body cell depending on which one they use to satisfy the culture, the evolution, and the faith of the devotee. He can allow His body to be destroyed by the very people He came to teach, only to demonstrate the non-corruptability of the body which sooner or later the disciple would have to accept as testimony of its existence or He can cause the body to be consumed and later reactivated and He can cause the body to disperse itself and become another form. I&rsquo;ll give you an illustration, there was a great saint, I&rsquo;m not going to use the Master Jesus because this is already known that the body resurrected, I&rsquo;m going to use another Master who had the choice of using the body at death for that particular reason. He was a teacher to two different religious faiths, the Muslim and the Hindu. When He passed on by a custom one faith required to burn the body, another faith required to bury the body and in the constant debate between his students, He got out of the coffin and disappeared and left them two bunches of roses as a gift of His eternal nature, you see, when they opened the lid the body was gone and there was left two bunches of roses. So one group took one bunch and burnt it and one group took the other bunch and buried it, stuck with the customs, but not the reality of themselves, do you see? It is necessary that Masters accept pain as a personal struggle to indicate to a disciple that he too can conquer by the right information his divine nature in pain and that he should not look to pain as the means of which you&rsquo;re gonna eventually die and decompose, death is here as a measurement from one level of existence to another level of existence but Masters use that measurement to instill further faith and conviction that Man is Soul but Man may not accept this realization via the lifespan of the Master and not ridding himself completely of any association with the concept that he has Soul therefore he must discard the body too, but Masters will do another thing, They will use death as a measurement to leave you a body that defy rotting. 1:50 You see this is a measurement they will use to show the eternalness of life based on a truth of consciousness that Man is Soul and once it is linked up to the false idea that it has, then the repercussions of disintegration is there. Now the worst thing someone can do you is to say, &ldquo;the destroys of the Soul,&rdquo; that is to destroy your understanding of the trueness of your nature and tell you you have a Soul, he&rsquo;s worse than if he stuck a knife in you and kill you, but if one tells you all the time that you are Soul and you make the necessary effort to discipline the emotional nature to realize that, then you have the greatest relationship existing. The killer of the Soul is one who tells you you don&rsquo;t have, I mean the one who tells you you have a Soul he&rsquo;s really killing that divine spark in you by constantly telling you you have a Soul instead of saying that you ARE Soul. He&rsquo;s really killing a divine contact, a divine truth, he&rsquo;s killing any effort on your part to realize or go on further in realization as to the trueness of your nature, you see what I&rsquo;m trying to point out? This is a worse type of killing to an individual than to take a knife and stick him because sticking him with a knife, if that Man has a spiritual link with some Master, that Master can restore his life back, like in the case of Lazarus, one instance, death out of the grave. Well you see death is a thing there too, here&rsquo;s a man who supposedly called dead and buried for three days and from the standards of measurement you would say, &ldquo;Gee Master if You were here if we wouldn&rsquo;t be suffering like this, we wouldn&rsquo;t be this type of grief, emotional tone would be so low, You could do something,&rdquo; and even then it was a sort of a three ring circus from their standpoint and it was a tendency from their standpoint to always feel that they have Soul and He gets out and knowing that they don&rsquo;t have Soul He has to be firm with the disciple and He makes a declaration, &ldquo;Lazarus come forth!&rdquo; in the tone of voice but then with certain personal analysis, &ldquo;I only said it because of the masses, did not have to say it in this tone of voice.&rdquo; It could be a mental radiation, knowing the truth of the thing, that Man is Soul but because these are so fixed in their ways that they have this condition, He has to knock it out, psychologically discipline them, by the illustration to free them and when he came back into the living form would you not say that when his time to realize himself, discard the form, but you see one does not ask, &ldquo;did Lazarus discard the form or was Lazarus aided to a higher evolution after being given a second boon of life,&rdquo; life more abundantly, you see? Now evidence to that effect we don&rsquo;t have. Now evidence to Jesus body we have, we have an empty coffin, or a grave or sepulcher, evidence to that Indian Master was that two bunches of roses which two factions of disciples, one buried it and one burnt it. Evidence of Yogananda&rsquo;s body non-decaying, evidence of St. Teresa, non-decaying. We have many evidences as the immutable law of this truth. Audience: St. Teresa did not decay either? Adano: No St. Teresa of Avila, Her body hasn&rsquo;t decayed, it&rsquo;s over 400 years now, she&rsquo;s not the only one, there have been many and don&rsquo;t think for one moment that the Catholic Church has a a priority or a monopoly in evidence of God&rsquo;s law, this would be quite a ridiculous thing to believe. The evidence of divine truth is in every religious organization. Audience: Yeah but I was thinking about&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know about this (inaudible). Adano: But that&rsquo;s Teresa Neuman, I&rsquo;m talking of Teresa of Avila or she was called St. Teresa of the Rose, but you see they have had this in many religious organizations and the purpose of it is to illustrate that Man is Soul all the time, he&rsquo;s the inevitable thumbprint of divine truth. In other words, &ldquo;I made this out of life and it will remain as such,&rdquo; this Creative Intelligence is putting His hand on us as a seal on Man to let him accept his divinity. We must&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard though because in when you discipline yourself you begin to see how come you&rsquo;re not getting there as fast and, you follow me, you start to think of the end result. In the discipline, never think of the end result, think of the effort you are making towards that result, be concerned with the step, each step, that you are making forward, the result is inevitable. Audience: (Inaudible) call it the achieving Cosmic Consciousness which Christ had reached so that then He passed bodily (inaudible). Adano: No, you see the Creative Intelligence is so well rounded out and balanced that every conceivable aspect of Its unlimited forces have already been established and will be experienced by the Soul. It will experience the opportunity to try again, it will experience the opportunity to overcome, it will experience the opportunity to remain permanently established because It&rsquo;s an inexhaustible source of light and energy: no beginning, no end, but eternal flow, world without end, world with constant opportunity as constant Beingness or permanent Beingness, it&rsquo;s a world with permanent Beingness. So if the life form or life energy has a new body form or slow down to a new body form to learn this very same lesson, it&rsquo;s not going to learn any new other lesson. It may develop many types of behavioral barriers to prevent it from learning the one lesson about itself, that it&rsquo;s Soul, it may invent psychological barriers to avoid the discipline of discovery that it is Soul, this is the prerogative of that nature also. You see how remarkable an inexhaustible intelligence it is? But it&rsquo;s a beautiful association and in fact only by the meditative withdrawal can you really assess it, there is no other way to assess it because you&rsquo;re constantly confronted by physical evidence of an eternal existence, everywhere you turn it&rsquo;s coming from mathematic electrical nature, back into the pure energy states, and if you see light dispersed, where does it really go? Has it gone out into time or space, is it in endless space? It&rsquo;s all back where it is. 2:00 Audience: Would not the current increase in the acceptance of the idea of reincarnation, even if people were not interested in meditation, wouldn&rsquo;t this idea alone spread or increase their acceptance of the fact that you are a Soul and you have a body or bodies? Just the fact that something reincarnates, something comes back again, won&rsquo;t that gradually increase the acceptance of the idea among the millions of people that he IS a living Soul? Adano: If the gradual acceptance&hellip; there has never been any true denial of such a principle, though it has been suppressed by various organizational groups over the centuries, let alone from the standpoint of science, we don&rsquo;t have a factual evidence to say that this is really occurring, we are still working from within. Externally we can only see the impossibility of Its non-existence you see? We cannot see the impossibility of It not wanting to exist, It is always existing, we see the possibility of It always existing, we don&rsquo;t see the the possibility of It not existing, or all tangible evidence show the possibility of existence of this life power and that it is not a dead universe in the sense that it is not the universe that we recede into total nothingness though we will we may call it disillusion or reservoir content, that all things go back into the reservoir content, but all things still come out back from the reservoir content, that means that Its eternal nature to exist is fully established. Now if It takes the avenue of utilizing various body forms in various cultural civilizations, in various language relationships and customs, this is Its prerogative but Its prerogative is not that only, it&rsquo;s the opportunity Its afforded the many times to realize the one basic truth, therefore if the evidence of such realization, the information of such (inaudible) can saturate our consciousness, we will accept it but we must not look for a mass revolution of acceptance because truth is not accepted in mass, truth is a personal slow re-evaluation from whatever standpoint of frustration you begin from and each one&rsquo;s frustration is not the same, where I may be frustrated at a certain point may not be your point of frustration, where I may evaluate may not be yours or his or so, wherever we reach that point in ourselves, there we have to evaluate. Audience: Are these truth of which you&rsquo;ve been speaking either recognized or even discussed in various hierarchies of Christian Churches? Adano: I&rsquo;ll give you a little story that once was told to me of a brother of mine that just came back from India and went to visit a Catholic monastery somewhere in Europe. He asked to visit the monastery in order to meditate because the monastery was recommended to had at one time an illumined Saint and the teachings of that illumined Saint were supposed to have remained in that monastery and followed by the monks who went to that monastery to study. After visiting the monastery for three days he saw no one meditating and he was the only one that sat in his room and meditated and speaking with them about the principles of meditation and inquiring into the manuscript, they told him this, &ldquo;You are fortunate to have found the way back,&rdquo; and that ended the whole visit, he left the monastery came back to the States. Audience: But can this really be extrapolated to the reference point say of the Catholic or the various other&hellip; Adano: In the various hierarchies, the profound depth to which we are talking of, there are a few, very few, who are aware but they cannot assume the responsibility of psychologically paralyzing mankind that is in the process of learning truth by slowly tearing down the organization. You know what would happened, you would have psychological paralysis all over, everyone would end up totally disrupted within this mechanism. It is a slow point of frustration within each one of us that we come to that we make the decision to seek the valid truth, it is that point of frustration where we are. Audience: What you&rsquo;re really saying that each individual has to reach a point where he can accept this truth. Adano: Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I said tonight, I cannot impose this discipline on you, I can only point it out what is involved this is up to you when that frustration point reaches if you want to use that discipline. Audience: Adano I am almost of the opinion, I wonder if it&rsquo;s not imposed that due to our past reincarnations you&rsquo;re either ready for this high truth when you get here or else you&rsquo;re not going to be ready in this lifetime. Now I know that I personally have been ready for it ever since I came on this plane, ever since I was born I mean this time. I know I have because when I was a child I used to, of course this is the highest truth I could find, but I would slip around since I got old enough to leave, I would slip around and (inaudible) go out and hide and look for all the truths, you know a long time ago (inaudible) and then I was all over my life looking for inspirational things (inaudible)so I came into this life ready for it and I just wonder if you don&rsquo;t have to be reincarnated into it and now I have my precious darling daughter. Adano: I am not saying no that you haven&rsquo;t have all these things, the evidence of eternal life proves it that the many times that life consciousness was exposed to the false concept that it HAS the Soul, these are the opportunities the Divinity is affording it to go out more, more life, the advantage of life being eternal is through this one eternal gift, the possibility will come in time, you will overcome and never go out no more, you will be a pillar in the house of the Lord, a pillar means a fixed principle, it ain&rsquo;t going no place, it&rsquo;s established and death is one of Its ways of establishing a fixed principle. Either the body is going to decay or it ain&rsquo;t gonna decay, either gonna get up and walk away or he&rsquo;s gonna leave a pair of roses there or do something, this is a fixed principle, this is the testimony we are trying to realize. So I&rsquo;m not saying that you haven&rsquo;t come to it, I&rsquo;m saying happy to realize it in this consciousness that you are going to meditate now with a full consciousness and know that if that is the thing you&rsquo;re doing. Audience: In meditation is our only way because just three weeks ago I was in meditation and I attended a lot of lectures and various things but I got so that I used to dwell in consciousness. So I found myself in a semi-awakened state I could start to pray, &ldquo;Oh Father&rdquo; and something which I call now (inaudible) said to me, &ldquo;Then be conscious that your consciousness is (inaudible) consciousness so infinite wonderful expressing through you and I kept saying it all day and the next morning I finished by saying when I&rsquo;m praying, &ldquo;I am emerged in this omni-conscious presence,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll tell you it was the most wonderful feeling. Adano: Yes that is exactly what I&rsquo;m talking of. 2:10 Audience: But I wish I could contain this, hold it. Adano: You see prayer is the kindergarten to meditation which is the adult approach of religion. Meditation is the adult approach to religion, it means work now, it is the real workload, it&rsquo;s the discipline, if a musician wants to be a musician he&rsquo;s got to work at it, he&rsquo;s got to work at those scales and those he&rsquo;s got to keep pounding away, a spiritual person&rsquo;s got to be pounding away at meditation. Audience: Meditation brings a realization, we may know and hear of the consciousness and all over and over by the teaching but through this meditation you will come into the realization of what you (inaudible). Adano: Right and the Master will make it available through revelation to you. See it&rsquo;s always revealed from within us this principle, we have to work at it until it&rsquo;s revealed from within. Let us have a little more meditation because I know this is the only true portable cup of joy that is available to Man without cost. When you dip in, what is most important in meditation, it is not one long session yet at times that one long session is vitally important to build up enough momentum but diving deep at intervals with tremendous intensity of awareness, this brings on much more. In other words the more repetitions you make of diving into the consciousness in a shorter space of time, the greater the momentum will be than if you just make it a sort of a marathon action and forced and become frustrated. By going a little at a time, coming out, not open the eyes completely, half open it, and savor it, you know it&rsquo;s like a good meal.</p>
<h2 id="1965---volume-2-dreams">1965 - Volume 2 Dreams</h2>
<p>Adano65_Vol2_DreamsQ1RRNW6 - &hellip; and the feeling reaction of yourself. Audience: Because of the fact that in this with the eyes closed there&rsquo;s nothing to distort or to disturb your thinking process and so it turns inward then you are aware of the inner goings on. Adano: Good now, so we will try the same gesture now and with the attitude I&rsquo;ve just described how you should put your mind because I said religion is a do-it-yourself thing so something you have to do to experience. I cannot take lysergic acid and let you have the experience you know, so I have to take it to experience. I got to meditate for the experience, you got to meditate for the experience, it&rsquo;s like eating bananas, I gotta eat it to know what it tastes like. So the same gesture that is common to all with a new attitude, let&rsquo;s see if we cannot realize a little expansion of consciousness. Audience: Well let me tell you something else that I ran into this past week that I was just flabbergasted with but even the scientists are finding it out. That when the eyes are turned at a 45 degree angle upwards even the mind clicks differently. Adano: Yes because the encephalograph measurement different, you see they are making measurements now on the various alpha rhythms of the brain in various physiological positions of the eye. There&rsquo;s a statement that once went, &ldquo;The eyes are the windows of the Soul,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s poetry description of truth, it is not that the eyes are not the windows of the Soul, the eyes are the windows of the Soul if you understand it from the standpoint of truth and be able to enter into that level of truth because these organs act like a lens you see, it&rsquo;s only reacting as a lens all around picking up light and leaving images in the retina which is transferred by photosensitive chemicals in the brain and in turn leave an image which is a light image that the brain computes and keep and store it. Now if you shut the eyes like that completely the eyeball itself can only go in one of three positions, it could remain focused like that or like this or like that. Now if I&rsquo;m like this there&rsquo;s a certain reaction in my brain going on right now and automatically I can see three different levels of consciousness moving out and if I keep it like this there is light coming down, I can see light in various colors coming down, I can see the aura then, if I look down then I have a tendency to agitate old memories. Now these measurements have been discovered to be so now in the human brain and is meant to be accepted by science. Now Yogananda came umpteen years ago and made this statement but Yogananda didn&rsquo;t invent this statement because His Guru came umpteen years before Him and gave Him that statement and His Guru came umpteen years ago and gave Him the statement. So this statement is a fundamental truth&hellip; Audience: But it&rsquo;s only been stated as a scientific fact in the last few years. Adano: Yeah, in other words as a scientific fact for the first time religion as a truth of the nature of ourselves is being experienced but now we have to update the language and religion but that doesn&rsquo;t detract from the devotional attitude of religion. You see you want to say this description of religion is so dry, so cold, but until you get the cold mush and heat it up and put the honey and the sugar it&rsquo;s not going to taste good, see? So you gotta heat up this action consciousness of yours from a cold state to make it feel good. So it is knowing cold facts about the reality of yourself that generates the true devotional attitude for self wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. You see some people are born with tremendous devotion, they know that there is God, they have an inner feeling for God that is the reality of themselves there but they cannot explain it to themselves and the only way they can continue in life is to feel a tremendous love for things, animate or inanimate. They cannot explain it to no one because no one&rsquo;s going to listen to them but this love seems to pour out of them, it seems to go out of them. Now sooner or later that very consciousness develops an understanding of the laws and it knows those laws, how it works. Now someone comes along who has total desire to understand the laws first because he cannot accept this blind attitude of craving for God, he wants to know the laws how they function, but after knowing the laws how they function and after being confronted with the evidence by a day by day analysis and positive facts of his existence, he realizes it&rsquo;s a waste of time to constantly pile up the brain with the information of facts only, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about time I start to concentrate on devotion experience, it&rsquo;s about time I experience and experience the devotional nature, it&rsquo;s about time I really get some of these inner experiences that these people are talking about, you see? Audience: And you can experience in that realm without having this outpouring thing that goes with it. Adano: That&rsquo;s why we go into meditation. Now let us have a little meditation right now in other words if I want to tell you how this bliss is so beautiful and wonderful and simple, the best way is to taste it, I don&rsquo;t know no way else to get it, but to go inside. Audience: Would you like having a light out? Adano: Well you can subdue some light, not all, you know some people are scared of the dark but why should you be scared of dark we&rsquo;re all ghosts in the first place before we became human beings and we&rsquo;re going to go back and become ghosts and hunt some other poor human being. So there&rsquo;s nothing to be worried about, we are brothers of the dark just as much as brothers of the light. So there is nothing to be afraid of or any fear, there is no fear for God, God is the whole creative force, the idea is you&rsquo;re trying to realign your consciousness with this universal truth. Now in meditation normally you keep the spine straight you see and the spine is the actual altar of God, the eternal life principle in the human body that is a temple. Now every temple has got some little table which they call an altar and they have a wafer and wine and candles, they tell you that the Holy Spirit is present, Man is the only real temple in the universe, all the rest are imitations and this spine is the only real altar and the life principle is the only true God in all Man but Man don&rsquo;t know that, Man has got to discover this for himself in order to be free and meditation is his first attempt to discover the truth of himself by keeping the spine straight. (Meditation starts) I&rsquo;m not straining and not desiring to see anything or not to see anything, just gently close the lids but don&rsquo;t fall asleep, keeping the mind focused at the point between the eyebrows. Now since prayer has been accepted as a means of making communication with one&rsquo;s higher nature and other entities of higher qualities, it&rsquo;s only right that Man can show some homage in making some mental or verbal statement to that effect. When the Master Yogananda was on the earth plane He made a very simple prayer in which He included everything: &ldquo;O Spirit, Father, Mother, God, Saints and Sages of all religions, great Master Jesus, Master Swami Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, our Guru preceptors, we bow to Thee all. Free our lives from all obstacles that we may be able to realize the one reality within ourselves.&rdquo; 0:10 Now if the mind wanders don&rsquo;t let that disturb you, this is a normal action, the mind can only wander in one of three directions: to some thought or idea concerning the past and it will only generate some kind of an aggravation that you haven&rsquo;t accomplished it or you did accomplish it or the mind can wander to something futuristic and that too will generate some kind of anxiety, when will it come about or will it ever come about at all, but if the mind stays on the eternal consciousness of now which is the present that you live in and at the same time you are moving in space at tremendous speeds in relation to the galactic universe, at the same time you&rsquo;re an individualized creature on this one planet. The entire relationship of oneness now and the present now seems to reach out to infinity that there is no end to now and if all the stars are in motion and all the planets are in motion and we&rsquo;re on a planet moving through space and time with our fellow Man and every manifestation in the universe maintains its right orbit, then the universe is at rest. Not at rest by being inactive, the universe is at rest by being totally active, active in harmony, active in mutual relationship to each other, this is the true rest, this is the divine peace that passes all understanding. Those who have Gurus, Teachers, or any Patron Saint or have some ideal of a high nature can center the mind on that because the mind loves to drift, sooner or later it will drift away from the present now, it will drift away from the one I AM self, it will drift away from the one true knowledge of self, seeking either the past or the future, but if we apply devotion, that is an intense alertness to maintain that attitude of now, we can begin to experience Oneness or Divine Unity with peace, the very source of bliss, the source where thought begins to flow. (Meditation). &ldquo;Beloved Masters, we Thy disciples gathered in communion, we surrender all our ego desires&hellip; for the one true desire, God realization. (Meditation). Heavenly Father, one universal life, Thou hast become us all, may we realize this truth, freeing ourselves from the delusion of separation, freeing ourselves from the delusion of being uninformed about ourselves. Having become us, we are now manifesting awareness and understanding at the various levels to which we aspired. (Meditation). Divine Mother, we who are seeking into ourselves may stumble upon many many mistakes over and over again but without these mistakes we could never learn fortitude, endurance, understanding, enthusiasm, courage, and dignity. Therefore Divine Mother the greater the challenge You present to us, the greater You supply us with understanding to meet the challenge. Let not this source of communication ever dry up or die out within us, let us always be able to uncover the source of initiative, endurance, enthusiasm, creativity flowing from within ourselves. Let us always seek within the silent consciousness the intuitive nature that leads to the unerring decision. (Meditation). Beloved Masters we thank Thee for Thy presence, bestow Thy blessing upon this home in which this meeting is gathered.&rdquo; 0:20 Meditation is the one source through which we can make contact but greater than that we should be able to meditate wherever we are, under any condition, in the busy activities of life the bond of communion should never be broken between Man and the Creator for the Creator is in the Man. May each one of us realize our higher selves a true light of divinity. Now slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move, try to hold on to the peaceful after effects. As you open the eyes gradually squint them, not wide, gradually adjusting the various levels of perception occurring right now within you and at the same time bringing back from outer space your association with life into the immediate relative realm of the room. Thank you. Audience: Adano would you tell us again about the effect of looking upward in the eyes or straight out or down. Adano: When you look down you automatically agitate the subconscious you see and those ideas that are residing in the subconscious or memory levels come up so when you sleep your eyeballs are actually turned down you see. In sleep research we have various measurements and one of the things in sleep research or what you call the rapid eye movement that goes on, we dream you see. Now dreaming is important to us, if we don&rsquo;t sleep and dream to a certain extent something would happen to the brain. Now it is not important at another level, I&rsquo;ll put it a different way, important things first, the more important things become important the least important they are, do you follow me so far? Audience: You really got me loused up (laughter). Adano: Important things are first right, everybody goes about shouting &ldquo;this is important&rdquo; and he does it first. The more important these things become, the least important they are eventually because there are other levels that you&rsquo;re going to go on, you cannot get stuck on that one thing you see. So dreaming is important to a certain level but then dreaming is no longer important at another level, you see you go past dreaming. Now Master users say that you dream by your own volition through your own effort and you dream because you have no volition. Now you can create a dream yourself, you can close the eyes and dream, that is you can begin to image where you want to be in the dream but you have to take that flow or source from subconscious relationships, you cannot dream something or generate something that you haven&rsquo;t been associated with on your own volition. Can you say, &ldquo;Well I want a dream&rdquo; and stop right there, you didn&rsquo;t give no description of what you want to dream and somebody says, &ldquo;what you want to dream about?&rdquo; and then I says, &ldquo;Well geez, what is it I wanted to dream about?&rdquo; What is it? What symbol was it, what association was it, you see? Okay I want a dream about a lamp but a lamp is an association in a language relationship you see. Now I don&rsquo;t want a dream and one of the funniest things can happen, you find yourself dreaming more because you automatically set off a condition in your consciousness that by not wanting to do something, the consciousness is pulling down from the subconscious, you&rsquo;ve lived your life so long in subconscious associations and memory patterns, they gotta come up, so that&rsquo;s past. So the eyes go down and you&rsquo;re sound asleep. Now if you hypnotize the person the eyeballs don&rsquo;t go down, they always go up you see. Now when a person is dead and you lift the lids up you&rsquo;ll find the eyeballs are turned up. Now you notice under hypnosis and at death the eyeballs are turned up, in meditation the eyeballs are turned up. Now we got a three-to-one condition happening here, in sleep the eyeballs go down, in dreaming the eyeballs may also go down or go up and it may fluctuate, have an up rapid eye movement. Audience: Yeah because I understand that&rsquo;s how they tell that you are dreaming is the movement of the eye. Adano: Right, now to stop dreaming and to fix the consciousness then is to put the eyeball up at a 45 degree angle and this puts like a governor on the alpha rhythm of the brain, it stabilizes it. Now in meditation you are doing exactly the same thing, you are focusing it. Now let&rsquo;s see if this coincides or validate religious thoughts, &ldquo;If thine eyes be single, dash, the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; Now where that dash, there&rsquo;s a word missing there because how can you make your eyes single and how can the whole body be full of light and this was a statement made by a great Master. Now this is supposed to be a spiritual statement, a religious statement, yet it is a statement of fundamental truth involving God, creation, involving yourself. So let&rsquo;s look at it objectively and see if all these things don&rsquo;t tie in to what we&rsquo;re talking about shifting of the eyes. &ldquo;If thine eye&rdquo; well it doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;If thine eye,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;If thine eyes&rdquo; that means two, &ldquo;be single,&rdquo; be single what? You can&rsquo;t take the two eyes and pluck them out and put them into one, so it means you only use your eyes for one purpose, vision, so &ldquo;if thine eyes be single visioned&rdquo; and that doesn&rsquo;t mean like some psychologists would want to say &ldquo;if your eyes are centrally motivated towards maintaining a straight and narrow path in your life,&rdquo; it don&rsquo;t mean that, that is a psychological illustration of that terminology, that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with it, in fact it&rsquo;s sheer imagination to think of it that way. &ldquo;If thine eyes be single vision,&rdquo; that is if these two optical organs are focused in like a telescopic lens, you would have what the Beatles would say, you have a kaleidoscope vision, &ldquo;Katie with the kaleidoscope eyes,&rdquo; the girl with the kaleidoscope eyes but these are all facts of truth about ourselves. The light prism would work, these two nerves will pull in and focus and light will come out, the whole body will be full of light, you will see a light, a light is there when you close the eyes and look in. 0:30 A light is there, it is always there, it has always been there and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehends it not. The uninformed is the darkness, you being uninformed when you look inside you see a little flick of light, &ldquo;Oh I got bad eyes, I gotta go see an oculist,&rdquo; many of us have thrown away, what you say, our heritage for (inaudible). That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re doing, we&rsquo;re throwing away spirituality for something we don&rsquo;t know, you see. &ldquo;When thine eyes are single visioned,&rdquo; or focused, &ldquo;the body is full of light&rdquo; and this is the first tangible experiment or experience of a divine truth, that Man goes back in here all the time to its God, God is eternal light. Now but you don&rsquo;t close your eyes and look this way, you never pull the lids down or I&rsquo;m not looking that way, it&rsquo;s not possible, after a while the ball has a tendency to rise to a 45 degree angle. Why it has a tendency to rise? Because nature has so constructed the nerves to feed into the pituitary gland that eventually the the organ pulls itself up there. Now once it&rsquo;s focused and is fixed and if you&rsquo;re fortunate to see that little light flickering like a firefly, it starts like a firefly and it swells and swells and one day as you constantly watch it or nurture it or what the Quakers say, &ldquo;sitting in vigil&rdquo; or &ldquo;trimming the lamp,&rdquo; these are only terms to say, &ldquo;do this thing,&rdquo; watch this particular inner light inside this brain of ours, it will explode like an atom and this would be exactly what the Bhagavad Gita says, &ldquo;like a thousand suns,&rdquo; and you would have an inner sight. Now an inner sight don&rsquo;t mean you need this physical organ to see, it means that throughout this entire cellular mass it has become an &ldquo;I,&rdquo; &ldquo;I universal.&rdquo; Anyone who had these experiences know that this is happening to them all the time. Now it is there in that light that the Masters say as you call astral light now. Audience: Is this the thing that Yogananda at the time when Yogananda suddenly was aware that he saw forwards, backwards&hellip; Adano: Kaleidoscope eyes, what&rsquo;s the song that the Beatles sing? Girl with the kaleidoscope eyes are a clear vision, clairvoyant, &ldquo;clair&rdquo; you see it comes from the french word clairvoyant, voyant means vision, clair means to see through, clearly for the first time, to see true clearly for the first time through the organ not with the organ. Most of us think we see with the organ you know but we are seeing through the organ therefore we can transplant, do many things with it. This is for that reason we understand what is happening in ourselves, we are seeing through and therefore Master said he was seeing through His head front, back, and everything. Anyone who have had this particular experience know this is happening all the time. Now yet this particular experience has certain physiological functions, these functions are there, it turns up and it&rsquo;s fixed. Now after a while you may appeared to the public to be squinting and hence we are all orientals with quint-eyes, we end up like that you know. Now you can see why the the the genetic change of the Oriental from the round eye to an almond shape, he&rsquo;s too long squinting, trying to find the light you know. I&rsquo;m just joking. Audience: In the realm of stars which you might find yourself into by allowing Master to turn your eyes inward rather than making any physical effort, would seem to me is only the beginning of the journey. Adano: Oh yes! Wait a minute, don&rsquo;t mistake that I&rsquo;m saying that this is the end friend, no. We are discussing what has been slowly accepted and validated by science as a stepping stone, in fact it&rsquo;s not a stepping stone, it&rsquo;s the mere fact that you learn to start the alphabet with letter &ldquo;A,&rdquo; you haven&rsquo;t gone through the alphabet yet. So &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the first one you write, this is only a relationship I&rsquo;m using or analogy, that the putting the eyes here and watching is the starting point of your journey, the longest journey begins with the first step but where is the first step? You do not know how to look inside of yourself, so someone has to point out &ldquo;step one&rdquo; to the journey within. Now this journey can begin under many conditions, someone pointing it out to you whereby you make a physical attempt to do it yourself or you may be involved with an accident that you&rsquo;re forced into it or someone can be ill and in order to comfort that ill person you may rock them to revere or do something and eventually find yourself going into that state. There are many ways that you end up one way or the other looking in yourself, in other words this Divine Consciousness has so worked out the mechanics that sooner or later one of the little traps or techniques that It devised you&rsquo;re going to get hooked in it to go back to letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; to the starting point. In other words the hound of heaven is chasing you to the gates of heaven you know, in other words this inner self is still pulling you back, these are all poetical descriptions of what a thing is happening to us. Now this realm in here is star-like that&rsquo;s why they call it astral it&rsquo;s like a star, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that but why is it a star? That&rsquo;s the important thing, it&rsquo;s not because it&rsquo;s a star we accept it as a star or a star of Bethlehem, these are all information pertaining to this same thing, why is it a star, and why is it a specific type of star. Anytime this light bursts open and slowly conditions itself we will find it has five points, five distinct points, and these five distinct points represent the five basic principles of creation fire, earth, air, water, ether and we are that, we are that in this human body: 16 chemical elements plus trace elements, composition is matter of the human body. We got 19 more elements that composes the astral or electrical body and the 19 plus 16 is 35 that is the 35 idea principles of creation, God is Man. Long before Man ever came along to realize himself, God already organize it and imprint it in an area we call the altar, the spine. Now I don&rsquo;t say that the spine is unimportant or is more important or the areas of the spine are more important or least important. In the spine there are levels, we have a lower level and a higher level, now you have a positive and a negative. Now below a certain portion of the spine is negative, above a certain portion spine is positive but therefore it resonates like a resonator it has to resonate like a keyboard. Now the Masters don&rsquo;t tell you to start at the lower scale or the lower register of the spine to find God, They tell you to start at one of the higher registers to find God. So it&rsquo;s not that Master Yogananda who said it, it was something that has been realized by all the Masters of truth until it was put in a very simple way. For the first time it was put, &ldquo;When thine eye be single, the whole body full of light,&rdquo; or &ldquo;none come unto the Father,&rdquo; cosmic light or truth, &ldquo;but by Me,&rdquo; this inner light, this cosmic light. In other words no Man can have cosmic consciousness without acquiring intuitive conscious self-realization, which is Christ-self. Now how you&rsquo;re gonna to acquire the Christ-self in yourself unless you go inside and who do you see, a Christ-realized Guru. He turns it on for you that&rsquo;s what initiation is for, a Guru only connects you up. The greatest relationship in the human body is the Guru/Disciple relationship, there is no other relationship not even mother/father relationship can compare with the Guru/Disciple relationship. It is the only true relationship, why? The Guru is a manifestation of Soul in active life and the disciple is a individual who thinks he has a Soul to discover that he&rsquo;s Soul sometime when the Guru extracts him from that uninformed condition. See the disciple always thinks he has a Soul, he doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s Soul, the Guru knows He&rsquo;s Soul all the time, has always. The day the realization, the enlightenment has manifested itself in the Guru, the Guru is Soul, the disciple is not enlightened, the disciple is not free, he is restricted by his habit patterns, he doesn&rsquo;t know, he is restricted by patterns of thinking, ideas that have come into his mind so he thinks he has a Soul. 0:40 Now the Guru acts as a mirror to him and says &ldquo;look at yourself see, see yourself a Soul, see what Soul qualities are, try to emit these things out of yourself.&rdquo; So if you have a problem don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;God remove the problem,&rdquo; &ldquo;God give me the strength to work the thing out,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s Soul quality, give it the Soul awareness now to battle the thing. As Yukteswar says, &ldquo;Face the thing and the thing will cease to bother you,&rdquo; Audience: Face the what? Adano: &ldquo;Face the problem and it will cease to bother you,&rdquo; run from the problem and it will always follow you in some form or manner. You cannot run from truth you see, you can only face truth, but the funny thing when you face truth all our pent up imaginable fears soon find like a balloon full of holes, they don&rsquo;t really exist because you&rsquo;re uninformed at the time when you&rsquo;re confronted with the thing. The moment you become informed you say &ldquo;Jeez whiz, it&rsquo;s like a sense I can go through it,&rdquo; being uninformed then you have the fear, you have all the worries. It&rsquo;s like somebody wants to learn to drive, he doesn&rsquo;t know the rules, he&rsquo;s uninformed and he fears, he fears, the moment he learns the rules and the information he&rsquo;s informed with it, where is the fear? This is the truth about ourselves, this is the truth of Soul. Once we are informed of the Soul&rsquo;s qualities, there is no fear to this Divine Devotion, there is no fear for God in Man, there is no fear to accept God in Man&hellip; Audience: Or to accept all experiences that come to you. Adano: Yeah, you see some Christians get up and say, &ldquo;There is no other way to truth but by Jesus,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re not saying something wrong yet but the way they say it to you, you will never accept it because they&rsquo;re not showing you the way to accept it correctly. Yet it is true that God is in Man but when you realize how God works in Man, how it works in you, you&rsquo;ll be the first person to accept Jesus in His form, much more profound the nature, much more an intimate relationship with Jesus in His true form than that man would be shouting all his life that Jesus is the only way to go to God. He may not ever have that inner experience that this is a something happen, you see. It was a time there was a man that lived in New York, a very advanced disciple of the Master and he thought that he had achieved the awakening of the inner vision you see and he came to visit the Master one day they were in the restaurant in California and he told Him, the Master, he says, &ldquo;I have astral experiences, I have this inner light opened up in me, I&rsquo;ve been doing it for years very successfully.&rdquo; So the Master says, &ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s see, let&rsquo;s put it to the test I say.&rdquo; So he says &ldquo;Well I look down now and they&rsquo;re upstairs in Mount Washington.&rdquo; If anyone knows where Mount Washington is and where the restaurant is, it&rsquo;s quite a distance. He says, &ldquo;Well I look down in the restaurant and I see there&rsquo;s a piano there and the Master says don&rsquo;t you see two women and a table and a chair?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Oh no I don&rsquo;t see any of that, I only see a piano.&rdquo; Well Master said to him &ldquo;Well then let&rsquo;s go down and check it out.&rdquo; A psychic experience must be validated by reality, otherwise it&rsquo;s a bunch of imagination or suppositions. So we want to know if technique and if a Master&rsquo;s intercession are both valid, see they have to be valid. A technique is that you are conscious of how to work it yourself, a Master&rsquo;s intercession is that you may not have to know how to work it but it will work just the same. Now both are important and there&rsquo;s a reason for both being important, the student and the Master went down and when they got into the restaurant all they found was two women sitting at a table with two chairs. Audience: No piano? Adano: No piano and all these years this Man was fully evolved to the extent that he was very successful with his astral vision. Master look at him He says, &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;ve been a victim of a highly developed imagination.&rdquo; Audience: Was that all it was? Audience: Well not only that you&rsquo;d have to admit the astral plane is certainly not anything other than kindergarten. Adano: We are not saying what is kindergarten or what is not, it is when you are confronted with a teacher or a Master, He is out to make you realize the mistakes you&rsquo;re going to make you see. Now I&rsquo;m not saying that when you start to meditate you&rsquo;re not going to see lights, you may see umpteen millions of them inside, it is the one light you&rsquo;re looking for, that one light that will open itself to you and that&rsquo;s what the Jesus and what all the great teachers are saying. That you cannot enter that inner awareness unless you pass through that one particular thing. Now the Masters have given three specific colors to this one light and a specific shape to that light and anytime you encounter it and if these three specific shapes are not there, or colors are not there, you&rsquo;re not going through it, it&rsquo;s then again the imagination that is at work. Now there is an outer ring of that light that is gold, strictly gold, is not a gold that you can even begin to imagine on this earth, I don&rsquo;t think you can begin to draw it or color it, it&rsquo;s not there. It&rsquo;s a gold that is so so brilliant but anytime your eyes hit it or perceive it, you have a sense of divine vibration, love and peace, right away you feel it, it&rsquo;s there in the room. You can feel a tremendous electrical flow going on, you can open your eyes and still feel it&rsquo;s going on, you know it&rsquo;s there and many people who have hit it will start speaking in tongues, they may even stretch on their hand and heal others unknowingly. They can they&rsquo;ll fall back like that, excuse me, and the person next door can be instantly healed and that&rsquo;s only the golden outer ring of that one light, they haven&rsquo;t even gone any further. Now the next ring that the Master is talking about, He says is color is blue, opal blue, and that is the Christ consciousness in Man. Now he did not say that was Jesus and that is what Jesus was referring to when He says, You see Me you see the Father.&rdquo; When you look inside and see this blue brilliant light for the first time, you will see cosmic consciousness, you&rsquo;ll come close to experience cosmic consciousness but you have to pass through that blue light into that white light to really say you have entered cosmic consciousness or illumination or achieve the degree of enlightenment. Now this gold light has many wonderful experiences around it, this blue light is even&hellip; how can you describe it? The gifts of the Spirit that comes with these awakening are obvious, no one can run from them, they are there, but how are we to realize it and how are we to apply it in our daily behavior, this is the trick, this is the thing that is demanding of us. How to apply these divine gifts to our daily behavior without making it a three ring circus? This is what we&rsquo;re wanting to&hellip; if we&rsquo;re going to God and calling on God to awaken our consciousness, we want not to apply God&rsquo;s laws as a sort of a three ringed circus, we would like to know that we are attuned to Divine Nature to work out our evolutionary life with an attitude of fortitude, understanding, courage, patience, and all the values and qualities that are truly of the Spirit. In other words the characteristics of the Soul, that is what we want because that&rsquo;s the thing that really works eventually. Now when these characteristics are functioning in us and that white light starts spreading, &ldquo;As a Man thinketh in his heart, that is what he is.&rdquo; From that from that day on if you say something, it has to happen. Yogananda once said to His sister, &ldquo;I am a Man of truth, I&rsquo;ve tried to speak the truth&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t say what we call truth and what the Master refers to truth is two different things you know. 0:50 Speaking of the truth, speaking of the reality, that is what he&rsquo;s talking of and if I say to you, &ldquo;Sister you shall have your weight exactly as what you want,&rdquo; it&rsquo;ll happen within a certain time and this has happened and it happens in many many cases not not only in Master&rsquo;s life. I don&rsquo;t like to bring myself into the picture because then you think I&rsquo;m boasting, but I&rsquo;d say this, once you know the laws of truth how they function you can say it and it begins to materialize. Whatever you say will begin to materialize and give you a little illustration. Jesus was preaching at one time there was a Roman soldier who had a son that was dying, he rode all the way from his home to meet the Master Jesus but he didn&rsquo;t know the Master Jesus. When he met the Master Jesus, he said to Him, &ldquo;If you but say the word my son will live,&rdquo; or &ldquo;my son will be well&rdquo; and the remark of that Master to that Roman soldier was, &ldquo;Never have I seen such faith in all of Israel.&rdquo; All the people who pretend to say they&rsquo;re seeking truth, never have He found one of them challenging or taking up the reality of truth and say, &ldquo;Here is a realized Man knowing what He&rsquo;s talking about, say the word, do the thing.&rdquo; You see what I&rsquo;m saying? Now &ldquo;Go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; With the word alone said in that concept, in that understanding of how this this universal law is working, He didn&rsquo;t shout out and say, &ldquo;Dear God please heal such-and-such a person,&rdquo; Or He didn&rsquo;t get down his knees and pray, He said &ldquo;Go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Why is it done? It&rsquo;s because He recognizes how this Man consciousness was functioning, is from the principle of authority, the principle of realization. In that centurion&rsquo;s life he was a Man of authority having control over a hundred men and if he gave an order it went down right down to the last man without question. Realizing this is how on a physical plane consciousness can work, he realized without even questioning the Saintliness of this realized Master, of His ability to work the laws from the highest point to the lowest point by the power of voice. He realized the same principle so he asked and the Master just said the word &ldquo;Go, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Now we&rsquo;re seeing the same principle that when this light, this white light opens up in us at that time we begin to realize and we are illumined, we are illumined to the fact that what we say now can materialize. Now if a Man is in Cosmic Consciousness, the gift of the Cosmic Consciousness is not only the illumination to the reality of himself but it&rsquo;s to the realization that whatever He speaks or think can have a physical form from then on. Now this may sound like a fairy tale but it&rsquo;s not a fairytale, it is a reality and it happens to many of us and we don&rsquo;t recognize it has happened to us. When it does happen to us we&rsquo;re taken back the way it does happen, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that we have control over it because it seems too simple to happen that way. We don&rsquo;t see magical movement of it you see that we can&rsquo;t accept it. Audience: You don&rsquo;t see a lot of powerful names, a lot of equipment, or a laboratory all set up. Adano: Quite true you don&rsquo;t see it. Audience: What you&rsquo;re saying of course is the very process of incarnation is to be given exactly what it is that you wanted, what you desired, your desire to be incarnated. You came with everything that you needed. Adano: All right let&rsquo;s go back to one fundamental truth&hellip; Audience: &hellip; but you still have to decide for the best. Adano: All right let&rsquo;s go back to the one fundamental truth, we are looking in and see you asked the question, &ldquo;when you turn your eyes down you are subconscious.&rdquo; Now if your eyes are straight ahead, you are conscious. Now I can go into the consciousness another way. Where was I in the past few seconds? Now you realize what we&rsquo;re talking about, we&rsquo;re talking of various levels of awareness. Now I&rsquo;m looking at you objectively and all the outlying bone structure and tissue is all brightened there. Now I&rsquo;m going to leave you and still look at you. Where did I go? Yet you felt something flow through the room. Audience: Even if you disappear&hellip; Adano: Right? You felt something move right through the room. All right so this is what we&rsquo;re talking, about we&rsquo;re talking of reality. You are all TV stations in this physical form or radio stations in the physical form. Right now I&rsquo;m broadcasting but I have no reaction on your body because I cannot link up to you but the moment I link into you that current will flow right throughout the entire being and other words I link into the eternal life energy that is flowing through us. God is life but all he who must enter God must enter God through life and you only felt it, you couldn&rsquo;t see it. You felt the flow, you felt an undercurrent, a strange undercurrent that is going on and this is what the great Sages are telling us, God is this undercurrent of life. He is there, a potential reservoir that we must learn to tap and if we can tap it we have many things to do with it, the creativity alone we can apply, let alone regulate our behavior in our life. That doesn&rsquo;t say a Man has to be a monk you know or has to be a nun or run away from the world, far from it. In fact the greater the obstacles a Man would face in this material realm to maintain his family life, makes him a greater Saint. Why it makes him a greater Saint? Because every instant he&rsquo;s challenged with the decision of to satisfy his ego or not to satisfy his ego. That doesn&rsquo;t say he doesn&rsquo;t provide for his family, that doesn&rsquo;t say he doesn&rsquo;t provide with dignity his own consciousness or his own well-being, he does but at the same time he&rsquo;s not carried away to the extent that he becomes ridiculously in consciousness or fanatical in consciousness. He doesn&rsquo;t run from anything, in other words he faces life, I&rsquo;ll give an illustration. One illustration that I think a few people are familiar in this room and that is, if I might use it, it&rsquo;s Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s son Bob. When I met Bob, Bob had a problem of facing the draft which is only normal in every American in this country as far as we go. I have another friend who was the same age like Bob and he had the same problem and this friend lived in California but I met the other friend before I met Bob. The same thing I&rsquo;m gonna tell this friend I told Bob, I told this friend I can&rsquo;t stop the Vietnamese people from fighting, I can&rsquo;t stop Lyndon Johnson from sending people to fight. The army is a reality, it&rsquo;s there, you are a reality, you are here. Now let&rsquo;s see what Divine Consciousness can do to solve the problem. 1:00 Now if you run away, that same problem will face you in some other form and sometimes in a more tragic form but if you go in and present yourself like a normal human being, I&rsquo;m gonna place a million bucks the one Divine Mother will come up with something most fantastic. Well for a while this boy didn&rsquo;t want to go, he and his brother had tug-of-wars wars you know, anyway he went. On the way that morning we were taking him to the induction center, we were driving and we&rsquo;re driving and we&rsquo;re just about a corner away from the induction center and he turned to his brother and says &ldquo;Al I don&rsquo;t want you to see me off I want to walk in on my own. Stop the car on the corner, I want to go on my own. I&rsquo;m going to take this Divine Mother&rsquo;s challenge.&rdquo; Well we didn&rsquo;t even reach the corner and all of a sudden, &ldquo;whang!&rdquo; That was the entire noise it made, the car stop dead, and he said to his brother, &ldquo;You just lost your water pump is broke&rdquo; and this is a brand new car. We came out exactly at the corner away from the induction center, he says &ldquo;Bye bye Al, bye bye Adano,&rdquo; and he walked away with his little knapsack into the induction center singing bluegrass. I look at his brother and his brother looks at me and says, &ldquo;I got a busted water pump here for sure.&rdquo; We got the car towed to the gas station, I says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s all Divine Will that is planned anyhow.&rdquo; Found out that this water pump was wrung like if a giant had a ticket and wrung it out, the shaft itself was twisted around. It took a while to take it off, the man quoted a price for the water pump and this price was on an exchange water pump of about $18, an exchange water pump for that model car. They phoned the guy and says, &ldquo;Yes we have an exchange, a rebuilt pump and we&rsquo;ll send it to you.&rdquo; We waited and the fellow came with the pump. When he took the pump out of the box instead of being a rebuilt pump, it was a brand new pump placed by mistake but we already paid the $18 bucks and he couldn&rsquo;t do nothing, he had to put it on. You see how in one day what had happened already? The boy has already gone in the Army and he&rsquo;s sent away for basic training and he&rsquo;s about to be shipped out to Vietnam so he&rsquo;s sent home for holidays to see his brother off before he leaves. He arrives home, one hour after he has arrived he gets a phone call from his superior officer saying, &ldquo;Instructions have just come through from above transferring you to military police to be stationed in South Korea and you have to come back for more training.&rdquo; So he looks at me and I look at this brother, I says, &ldquo;Well are you arguing with Divine Mother? You did your duty, She&rsquo;s got to do Hers,&rdquo; this is how it works. He went, performed his duty as a military police and he was shipped out to South Korea and all the time that he was in South Korea, this is the funniest thing, he says &ldquo;I am not on the battlefront and I am not wasting my time, I&rsquo;m busy meditating all this free time.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;If ever I got a chance to meditate I&rsquo;m taking it now on the government&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;This is my ashram, this is my Guru right now. I&rsquo;ve got it made.&rdquo; Two years sitting out there, looking at some people, trying to make them spiritual. He took advantage of it and he not too long came back and he was mustered out and he&rsquo;s gone back and forth his brother in Orlando but Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s son was in a similar situation, had a problem and yet when he went in, Divine Mother worked a particular way which puts him in a position that he wanted to go to fight. He didn&rsquo;t want to refuse to fight, he wants to fight, he really wants to get in the action and pull that trigger but everything he&rsquo;s got just kept them away from a gun. See, this is the peculiar part of Divine Law. As long as you don&rsquo;t refuse to face it, the problem, the greater law comes to work. It doesn&rsquo;t come to work if you say, &ldquo;I, God, am going to change the law,&rdquo; it comes to work in subtle ways because how is God is working in subtle ways? He is working as the vital life force, the vital awareness of human beings, for human beings. Therefore, God is in Man already, but Man cannot recognize it&hellip; (gap in tape) to build up enough momentum, but diving deep at intervals with tremendous intensity of awareness, this brings on much more. In other words, the more repetitions you make of diving into the consciousness in a shorter space of time, the greater the momentum will be than if you just make it a sort of a marathon action and forced and become frustrated. By going a little at a time, coming out, not opening the eyes completely, half open it, and savor it. It&rsquo;s like a good meal, just drink that good champagne of Spirit and then you go back and take another mouthful and come back, and you keep dipping in, keep dipping into it. Before you know it, you are getting further and further into the Consciousness, wider and wider into the Consciousness and more illumined in the Consciousness. Ok, just keep the spine straight, but don&rsquo;t strain and slightly close the lids and keep the mind at the point between the eyebrows, the reference point (meditation) and let the consciousness dwell in the right ear and try to listen to the audible life stream flowing through the body and around it and don&rsquo;t be too concerned if the mind drifts around, it&rsquo;s just natural, but what is most important about the drifting is the reference point. You don&rsquo;t want it to drift and latch onto to an idea concerning the past or an idea concerning the future, you want to latch on to the present, what you are doing. In other words as the man says, &ldquo;watch what you are doing.&rdquo; Watching, it&rsquo;s vigil, by internal watching and internal listening, the consciousness begins to rise into the Pure Consciousness and the luminescence of the inner light begins to glow and those who are listening, sometimes will hear the celestial music coming from the audible life stream, the music of Soul. (Meditation.) 1:10 Now gradually open the eyes, but not completely in order to feel the presence of peace permeating you, still being aware and alert. Now dive back in again into the inner conscious, go as deep in and as far out and feel the eternal flow of life and of joy permeating your being in the ocean of peace. (Meditation.) Slowly open the eyes but not completely, maintaining the peace, the awareness. Now let us dive for the third time very deep into the ocean of peace. Heavenly Father, beloved Jesus and the Saints and Sages of all religions, bless this meditation and grant us the protection to walk the path of the Soul to Its true nature and home within. (Meditation.) Slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move, gradually adjusting back to the environment and maintaining that peace from the inner reservoir of consciousness. (Meditation). Thank you. 1:20 (Gap in tape) &hellip;fears and frustration, eventually he ended up in a temple thinking that&rsquo;s the best place, better than going to a psychiatrist because he can&rsquo;t afford it, so his prayer would solve the problem. Well he was praying in front of the statue that he thought was ideal and it was a statue of Shiva but in front of Shiva statue there were a pile of books and logs and bags all kind of&hellip; eventually he was so exhausted in his prayer, he thought he heard the voice of Shiva talking to him, he says &ldquo;Oh God at last you answer my prayer in this deep frustration, I know what you mean in the night of the Soul that the Saints talk about. I&rsquo;m so glad that you can talk but then wait a minute, you made a brass, you can&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s still hearing this voice coming coming through like a beautiful piece of music. So the voice said, &ldquo;Do you think what you have is any better than what you will get? You see all those bags and books in front of you there, they are the troubles of the world of various people. If you can find one that is light enough to pick up, put you back, you can have it, you&rsquo;ll be free from what you have.&rdquo; So he felt each bag, each bundle, but none were light enough, not even the smallest one was light enough to lift up. They were too heavy, the only one that he could lift up was the one that he was carrying on his back, but just then a mouse passed in front of him and the mouse was carrying twice his weight in the size of a big piece of cheese and he couldn&rsquo;t understand how that was possible. He couldn&rsquo;t even carry twice his weight and he can&rsquo;t even carry smaller than his weight and here&rsquo;s a mouse carrying twice his weight in the size of a cheese. So he asked the Lord Shiva, he said. &ldquo;Lord Shiva, there must be some injustice, why am I placed in such a position only to lift what I have brought, I can&rsquo;t even lift another man&rsquo;s and here you ridicule me with a mouse carrying a piece of cheese twice it&rsquo;s weight.&rdquo; When he heard a voice coming back to him he says, &ldquo;Well I told you, greater the Man greater the obstacle, and the mouse is greater than you. So that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s carrying part of your karma.&rdquo; Audience: (Laughter) Oh that was a good lesson. Adano: Somebody is always carrying of part of our karma, in other words something is being carried by or shared by others, we don&rsquo;t carry all by ourselves. Audience: Well you might think you are once in a while. You feel like you are all the time, you feel like your little existence is as heavy as you can bear plus that of a couple of other people. Adano: Well you see an interesting thing about sharing or knowing that the load of one&rsquo;s emotional life can be shared or be carried by others mentally is a tremendous uplift but that doesn&rsquo;t say you have to be negligent to the extent that you totally surrender and don&rsquo;t do anything, then this is folly, this is an attempt to escape from yourself. See most of us because we are unable to carry our load and then all of a sudden we&rsquo;re comforted with the idea that part of the load is being carried by others, we drop everything that we&rsquo;re carrying too and want the other person to carry the other portion. Well it&rsquo;s not true, we&rsquo;re sharing the load with each other. See a Master does not remove your karma from you you know, He speeds it up to the extent that you&rsquo;re exposed to it faster, to the extent that you gain the enthusiasm and the courage and the will to be faithful to the truth that you can overcome it quicker, so that makes you a better person. Now if the Master denies you karma and make you what is called a life free from obstacles or conditions that interfere with a free flow, then the Master is not true to you, that&rsquo;s the beautiful part of a Guru/disciple relationship. By constantly pulling the rug out from under you occasionally or challenge your wits, you know making you more alert as to where the next test is coming, this kind of makes you aware of yourself and the potentials that are in yourself, the God-ness in you, you&rsquo;re able to call upon it, but we must realize that when we call on the God-ness in ourselves, there are many ways we call you know, this is based on the way we&rsquo;re educated to call or ask and what we want in certain frame of reference like, &ldquo;Dear God I am very sick now, I need to be healed.&rdquo; One moment, &ldquo;Dear God I&rsquo;m hungry, I need food.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear God I&rsquo;m broke, I need money.&rdquo; All these things are essentially true that we can pray like that and ask for it like, that that doesn&rsquo;t say it will not be fulfilled but that is one level of calling on the Divine Supply. Now there comes a time when that level works out, in other words all the experiences involved in calling like that peter&rsquo;s out, then you up and get angry and say God don&rsquo;t answer your prayers. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t that in itself a test? I mean you&rsquo;ve had this opportunity all this time to crowd on this thing, now it&rsquo;s about time for you to stand on your own feet. Adano: Right, this is good because this is spiritual growth, this is spiritual maturity, this is the attitude of behavior, the right attitude. That is actually what your Beatitudes really involve you see, &ldquo;blessed are the meek&rdquo; or &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not,&rdquo; all these different statements are intended to focus upon this attitude, that you can and eventually feel that presence all the time. Now the presence doesn&rsquo;t necessarily forced to fulfill your wishes, it will fulfill what you need to be fulfilling, at the moment it&rsquo;s being fulfilled. This is hard to understand because this calls for surrender of consciousness. Now it is hard to tell someone who is caught up in desire or caught up in&hellip; Audience: &hellip;what would you say materiality or is that wrong? Adano: No you you are living in a material world, you&rsquo;re not living in the&hellip; Audience: &hellip;I suppose you&rsquo;re giving it first place instead of&hellip; Adano: This is true at a certain level of your growth, you may say that I am giving this first place but in reality it is an essential part of your growth, it&rsquo;s like a kindergarten for your spiritual life. You have to give attention to certain physical things but you may not give the true attention to things that are truly there you see, there&rsquo;s a big difference. The true attention is not necessarily what&hellip; Audience: &hellip;detached attention&hellip; Adano: Right you see now detach don&rsquo;t say that you have a heart like stone you know, you have no compassion for your fellow Man, I don&rsquo;t mean that, it&rsquo;s to understand that there are times you should do absolutely nothing or anything to help someone than to attempt to do something and not help them. This may appear to be very hard-hearted but this is a fundamental truth of yourself. Audience: Well I&rsquo;m lost now. Adano: Now in other words your child is behaving naughty, you have a choice of doing two things spanking the heck out of it, chewing it out with you with words, denying it it&rsquo;s supper, one of those choices, put them all in one category of punishment. Then there&rsquo;s a next choice, you ignore him, you go about your work and as if he never existed. Audience: That would hurt worse. 1:30 Adano: Isn&rsquo;t that the same thing would happen if a Guru suddenly came into the room looked at all of us inside there and turned and walked out. Instead of looking at each one says, &ldquo;Now you need 18 more Kriyas, you need so many more days in meditation, so many days in fasting, and so forth, you need extra counseling.&rdquo; What would hurt all of us more? This is what They&rsquo;re trying to bring about you see. Now you cannot say He&rsquo;s hard-hearted, He is awakening a force in us which we don&rsquo;t want awakened. Audience: When you say we don&rsquo;t are you thinking in terms of something that inwardly we feel we would rather not have awakened because we know the consequences are? Adano: Yes, it means a painful experience, something taken from the norm of your happy-go-lucky way of existence. In other words, as long as nobody don&rsquo;t aggravate you, you&rsquo;re happy, but it&rsquo;s been proven the Man who aggravates you to your best development is a Man who really loves you, then a Man who fawns you and tells you you&rsquo;re doing good, he&rsquo;s not really helping you nowhere, you are still paralyzed with his happy comments you see. Somebody who prove you and tell you, &ldquo;come on get off&rdquo; and call you all kind of names like in the army you&rsquo;ll see that happens. There was a boy you know one time they picked him up on the road they were driving, so he&rsquo;s talking to us he says, &ldquo;There are some fellas in the army I hate, I can kill them and others I just love them.&rdquo; So Sonny says to him, my friend&rsquo;s son, he says, &ldquo;What do you mean you hate the men?&rdquo; He said this one guy he&rsquo;s always picking on me, he&rsquo;s supposed to be my buddy but he&rsquo;s always picking me calling me all kinds of names and everything and all the rest I can get along but he&rsquo;s the only guy I can&rsquo;t get along.&rdquo; So sonny says to him he says, &ldquo;Look have you ever been in a close tight squeeze in military performance where you can count on the guy who was calling you all kind of names more than those that were calling you they&rsquo;re your best friend.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah I think you&rsquo;re right. You know that&rsquo;s one guy I trust my life with,&rdquo; and right there he realized something because he says, &ldquo;Well you see who really likes you.&rdquo; If you can have confidence in the man who picks upon you and have no confidence in those who will fondly you tell you a good guy, why? What makes you decide inside that you can put your life in this man&rsquo;s&hellip; you see what I mean? The man who really is loving you and not fondly is the Man who is showing you your weaknesses in a certain way to make you stronger and a Master is doing exactly that. There are times He will not do a single thing, He won&rsquo;t even say a word, He may just come in the room or comment your meditation and look at you and He goes out and some of us you know say, &ldquo;Gee whiz, I meditate.&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible / laughter). Adano: &hellip; but this is sometimes true you see. In this way of helping a person or a group is sometimes to let it ferment for a while, let that consciousness ferment for awhile before you actually do something. Now the Guru really does not do anything, if you really understand the Guru, the Guru is only a symbol of God in action all the time and God is always doing the real force but God has become you too but you are not recognizing it. So you&rsquo;re hanging on to the Guru as some latch you know, &ldquo;Here I go, at last I got my rabbit foot or my reins upon the horse, you can ride me into the gates of heaven,&rdquo; but you know that sometimes the horse stamp his feet and you go falling right over into the ditch and then you say &ldquo;How come Guru, you let this happen to me?&rdquo; Well here&rsquo;s an illustration, our friend here Pauline was visiting with some people in California and a young girl who came all the way from Germany to be a disciple. Now there&rsquo;s a beautiful young lady, here she comes to work in America, she&rsquo;s coming all the way from a foreign country in high hopes, goes to work in the restaurant of the organization and has a tragic accident knocking a knife right into her eyes. You can imagine the tragic emotional content with the mother and they&rsquo;re coming and they are only two survivors of a family what it is and here she is coming all the way high hopes that this is the place where you come to have spiritual life to have such an accident? Now that is like being thrown off the horse. Now but the horse sometimes, though it throws you off, may reach out and drag you out of the mire at the same time, now that&rsquo;s what the Guru is doing. The Guru speeded up her karma, she was supposed by natural law of karma to have that injury, she must have done some thing to have that injury. Now well how is the karma to be speeded up? How is it to be compensated and how is it to be clarified or cleared out of consciousness? So she had to go through the physical pain and then to know that it&rsquo;s been healed and it&rsquo;s all the same Master consciousness doing the same thing. Now this particular condition could have happened let&rsquo;s say in another 20 years from now, when its normal time was supposed to occur and she may not have to be in the ashram of the Master and she might have been a married woman with four or five kids and her husband might have passed on and she&rsquo;s the sole supporter of the family. Now at that time she could have been anywhere in her 40s, now the reactions are different. Here she&rsquo;s a young beautiful girl and it&rsquo;s happening this way. Now right away in the human mind she&rsquo;s scarred for life, she&rsquo;s damaged, her beauty and all, so she giving up her life to the organization. You can see the whole world reaction but then you have to see the underlying point what a Guru is doing but it&rsquo;s not what the Guru the Man is doing, it is what God is doing through these forces, He&rsquo;s making you conscious. So carrying the load of others is a very important thing because now how is the load carried in her case? The vibrations of those meditating in that ashram and the immense mutual love for each other going there, so that sometimes the love is not always pure you know, though we live in ashrams or around the feet of great Saints that doesn&rsquo;t say our love is so pure. It&rsquo;s full of cross currents, full of competitive reactions you know, who is more plucked out in petals in front of the Guru like a straight stalk? Who is more clear you know consciousness, all these things are flustering inside but there is a common bond, a love for the Guru consciousness, a common love that is there, that is carrying the load. Her feelings that she is in the presence of others of like consciousness, she&rsquo;s in the presence of others who have the same motivation to realize themselves no matter they have competitive attitudes, this is novel. If we don&rsquo;t have it then we don&rsquo;t need to live in an ashram. An ashram is a hospital for sick Souls that&rsquo;s all it is, so don&rsquo;t look at it as something high on a pedestal. It&rsquo;s a place where the Soul goes to be healed. It&rsquo;s also the place where you&rsquo;re sharing the burden and the burden is shared with you too, you&rsquo;re carrying somebody&rsquo;s load. If you remember one time I told you in the Indian Kivas where they hold their ceremonies of healing, they do not pray for themselves, they pray for everyone in the room. Now if each Man pray for the other Man in the room and let&rsquo;s say there are nine people in the room and you make the tenth person, how many times nine people are praying for you? Audience: I&rsquo;d like to ask you something about that. Does everybody, say for instance Myrtle, does everybody pray for Myrtle and then everybody prays for another person or do you just pray at random? Does everybody just pray at random for somebody? Adano: No, let&rsquo;s say, in the meeting it&rsquo;s like this, let&rsquo;s say&hellip; I&rsquo;ve attended them and this is how they do it&hellip; tonight is a Satsanga, it is a meeting in the Kiva. This meeting it&rsquo;ll start like this, &ldquo;Friends, brothers and sisters, this meeting is being given by the Bauris family. Now they have a problem or they have some condition that is involved, now let&rsquo;s say they have something they want solved in a meeting, it&rsquo;s a meeting for healing something. Now join me brothers and sisters with good thoughts that we solve these problems. Do not think of yourself.&rdquo; 1:40 Now they don&rsquo;t ask, they don&rsquo;t say nothing else past that point and all through night they may just sing and chant and then they&rsquo;re going to turn around to someone and say, &ldquo;Well brother you want to say some good word for the people?&rdquo; At one time they pointed to me and says, &ldquo;Well we have a brother here who is a spiritual brother and would you say a few words.&rdquo; So I prayed but I didn&rsquo;t pray as if, &ldquo;God help Mr. Bauris or God help Mrs. Bauris in their problem.&rdquo; I prayed that light will shine in the minds of all present that this problem that is there would be carried out. In other words it will be given a boost on its way out, out of consciousness, they are praying in their own language in a similar way. Now it comes to a certain point of the meeting a woman gets up and she&rsquo;s praying, she&rsquo;s asking for God in her consciousness for her sister Mrs. Bauris, they would call her sister Joan or sister Mary, whatever her name you know, or brother Schmidt, they call him by the first name, they&rsquo;re very formal people, and they&rsquo;re praying. They say, &ldquo;Well sister Myrtle is in great need of help, we don&rsquo;t know what to do but we are praying with good thoughts so hold with me and join with me in this moment, in this dark moment,&rdquo; and this is happening at night, see it happens at night that that they bring them out into light and this thing goes on like that, each one is saying something in that fashion and it&rsquo;s keeping your consciousness always on the problem. Not the problem itself, what is the problem, but the source of this condition. Now it comes just about dawn when that light hits the dawn&hellip; Audience: They do this all night? Adano: Yeah that dawn comes and the head man starts to pray now. His prayer is very simple, brief, specific, and it&rsquo;s right there the miracle happens. He prays this way, he says, &ldquo;God and all the great Holy Ones that hold the universe up and we are mere mortals, we are praying for our brother and our sister who has fallen from grace to have such a problem in their lives at this moment, but we only ask one thing, this morning now that they be relieved.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you Lord heal the person, you don&rsquo;t ask you want it tomorrow, you know. He says, &ldquo;This morning now I&rsquo;m asking for them to be relieved.&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t ask him to be cured, there is a big difference. He didn&rsquo;t tell him how to cure the person and when you use that word, &ldquo;this morning to be relieved&rdquo; and you look over that sick person, you should see the turning of their body and before you know it I&rsquo;ve seen people walk out. It&rsquo;s a simple metaphysics. Audience: Adano, this carries on all night for the benefit of one person or it turns around? Adano: No it&rsquo;s a benefit for all. The concept is basically this, problems live, germinate, multiply, in the darkness of your consciousness. Therefore it happens in the darkness of night that you&rsquo;re praying, it&rsquo;s a very simple psychology, very important too if you can let the mind work for you and at dawn in the light when Man feels he&rsquo;s healthy, isn&rsquo;t that what you do in the morning? You wake up, you feel refresh, relax, you want to vibrate yourself. So at dawn they make a very important issue of it to say, &ldquo;Now at this moment be relieved, be lifted out from this darkness, see the light.&rdquo; All your religious teachings are saying, &ldquo;May I carry myself into the light, may I go out from the darkness into the light, may I drop my burdens from the darkness and start to live a new life in light.&rdquo; These are all the same patterns you see, now they make a ceremony of this pattern system and at that moment when they make the final declaration, it is for everybody in the room, sort of a crystallizer thing. Now he&rsquo;s finished praying then, there&rsquo;s a second Man who&rsquo;s going to pray. Now he prays is different way, he&rsquo;s forgotten you. At the moment the head man prays at dawn concerning your problem, any person that prays&hellip; there only two others are free after. What they pray about has nothing to do with the problem and never again you were mentioned in their prayer or anyone being asked for healing is not mentioned, the prayer is entirely different. It&rsquo;s a prayer in which man and woman is recognizing an obligation to the universe, his love and his attitude towards the mineral kingdom, his love and his attitude to the vegetable kingdom, his love and the same attitude to the animal kingdom, and that same love and attitude should extend now to the human kingdom, and finally in each one&rsquo;s own makeup, this love and attitude should extend into the spiritual kingdom. Now they end their prayers out in that whole makeup and you don&rsquo;t hear them mention that brother Bauris or sister Bauris needs more help. If you don&rsquo;t get a certain relief by the time they&rsquo;ve asked the relief, you better put out another meeting tomorrow night. I have gone over to talk to these people and they are relieved, many of their problems they&rsquo;re relieved. Now and it&rsquo;s been carried out, that&rsquo;s what you say the karma has been carried out, the action. Don&rsquo;t think of karma as being something bad, the term doesn&rsquo;t imply bad nor good. Audience: Because it is the law of the action&hellip; Adano: &hellip; action of lifting the consciousness from one level of accepted patterns of thinking to another level of accepted patterns of thinking, whereby you are synchronized with life itself and this is the normal metaphysics of most of what we call so-called primitive people but it&rsquo;s a genuine metaphysics, it&rsquo;s a genuine religion. In fact this is the true Christianity. Audience: What is the name of that religion? Adano: Christianity. Audience: Just Christianity? Adano: Yeah what is Christianity? We use the word religion and we really don&rsquo;t know what we are saying until we investigate into it, then we will find that this word breaks up into three categories. One, it breaks up into churchianity or doctrines, certain prescribed creeds, do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of existence which eventually become legislation, politics. Then you go into another category of this word religion, it runs into organization and the kids call it the establishment. They&rsquo;re right because you can&rsquo;t fight the establishment, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s already pre-set for Man to exist in a certain organized form of existence, he&rsquo;s a cultural creature. Now when you look at the last aspect of religion and you see now an intelligent search into the reality of yourself. Now this is the last part no one wants to know about because this is the part that is ego shattering, to know that you are an organism that must work out certain modes of behavior and gesture in order to realize the trueness of your nature, this calls for work. Audience: And it isn&rsquo;t always pleasant. Adano: No it&rsquo;s not pleasant work and sometimes it&rsquo;s very very abrasive you know, it rubs too hard on the ego and sometimes it leaves little scars there you know but this is the third part of religion. Now it is this part that Man really should be interested in. It makes for the foundation for the other two parts, the other two parts have a legitimate reason to exist, that is the establishment, the organization, and the doctrines that lead to legislation and behavior in the moral society but they have no basis in a genuine way without the third part, the reality of Man himself what he is. Until you know what you are, these two have no value, they fluctuate and therefore we are hypocrites to ourselves, that&rsquo;s why if the kids say you&rsquo;re a hypocrite, he may call himself a hippie but it has no degradation or anything, it&rsquo;s a fact that one is seeing the falsity in certain things that he doesn&rsquo;t want to associate with. In other words we&rsquo;re trying to find a vantage point that corresponds to the laws of nature in order to live our lives and the third part is where we begin. Now the third part is pure science. When I use the word science don&rsquo;t think in terms of some test tube or some file of mathematical conditions, it&rsquo;s a science and at the same time it&rsquo;s an art. First it must correspond in action to all that the laws of creation are involved with, this is truth itself. 1:50 The scientist is aggravated when you talk to him about religion because he is caught up in the first two categories, the doctrinal part and the organizational part, but he would be willing to listen to the third part, the scientific nature of it, where it fits, because you will begin to see a relationship, you see the identical thing that he&rsquo;s searching for. Now it is this part that certain primitive tribes have learned to engrain in their consciousness unused, they have sifted out certain conditions that they&rsquo;ve observed over the years and applied them, this certain simple rules of the third part that they&rsquo;ve learned to use and they&rsquo;ve found it very very effective. Now the third part involves an attitude or a gesture which you call prayer, you see. Now I&rsquo;m not using the word in any degrading sense, I&rsquo;m trying to show you a point in which this one peculiar gesture or behavior remains in every so-called religious group. There is a tendency for Man to get into a mood or a gesture or an attitude of supplicating an unknown force to solve an immediate problem and by talking it out with this unknown force in his own little way, he&rsquo;s hoping that this unknown force is going to solve the problem, this is the mechanics is what is occurring in prayer. Now but this prayer mechanics it can be divided into three levels, it can be a rabbit foot level where you rub it like a rabbit foot and ask for something or a genie in a lamp, you know big boons, or it can be a facing up of yourself in relation to how you live your life. This condition brings release, this condition brings you to the source of what you&rsquo;re really searching for, it brings you that calmness, it brings you the inner peace that you&rsquo;re looking for, the inner joy, the inner wonderment of being alive, and at the same time it brings you the inner satisfaction that something is working through you and allowing you to experience those values that are not normally acceptable in the convention we live in. You see certain values that convention accept become very pat and don&rsquo;t&hellip; (inaudible) Now if you have this a certain opening up of consciousness you start to see the rate of values beyond that, for the first time you start and have an extension of awareness as to what a real value of a thing is. Audience: I was wondering what that extension&hellip; Gladys and I have been taking this course, this is a scientific approach to the same thing and when you say awareness I think this is what Mr. Silva is trying to tell us is going down into this realm of the inner consciousness really. This sudden awareness is a thing that will take you to that area that produces a result. It&rsquo;s only when you reach that that you&rsquo;ve got a result. Adano: All right if you backtrack a few you&rsquo;ll find that there are a few words you&rsquo;ve used that give you the clue to the manipulation of the thing. &ldquo;The going down,&rdquo; keep that statement in mind, &ldquo;the sudden,&rdquo; these two statements are the master keys of triggering consciousness all the time. Tonight was a certain unexpected and yet expected manifestation of my presence here right and the reaction what occurred, it broke all tension and allowed bliss to flow. If you can understand this peculiar mechanics, this is how consciousness really works, this is how super consciousness is possible for us. When the restrictions are pulled apart, it this is like (sucking sound), you&rsquo;re sucked in you see. It is a sudden pull out, it takes you unaware and because it takes you unaware there&rsquo;s a certain amount of fear in all of us, the fear of the unknown, what would happen, what to expect, it doesn&rsquo;t conform to the information written in a book. In other words life don&rsquo;t flow through a mother and her baby the way it is written in a doctor&rsquo;s manual. The child is being carried in through labor and into the operating table you know, it&rsquo;s the same thing, you can read of this thing in a manual but it doesn&rsquo;t function like that inside the person. You can read or hear of the awakening but the sudden shock of the awakening from one level of awareness to another level, it&rsquo;s something else, you&rsquo;re not ready, it&rsquo;ll pull the whole roof apart but if you can recognize that something is happening inside of you and if you don&rsquo;t fight it&hellip; you see this is where love and pain are two qualities or two conditions that come in to make this awareness of yourself sharper. Pain comes and you&rsquo;re forced to&hellip; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fight this pain and then I&rsquo;m gonna call on this God to help me and brother if He don&rsquo;t help me, I&rsquo;m going to curse the hell out of It.&rdquo; Then love comes along, &ldquo;what for,&rdquo; guilty complex, guilt complex,&rdquo; how can God not help you, He made you&rdquo; and you start talking all over to yourself in circles and before you know you&rsquo;re relaxing, you stop tensing up and then relaxing all of a sudden you get so goddamn tired you (snoring sound) fall asleep but when you open your eyes you feel refreshed. &ldquo;Thank God let&rsquo;s start all over again.&rdquo; These are various things that happen to have most of us at times, we go through a series of arguments for or against in pain and suffering, come out. Masters are only saying to us that we must learn the science of this consciousness or religion in order to manipulate it. Now when I use the word manipulate it, I don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re gonna use it to go around performing like a circus you know, this is not what it was intended for. Religion is intended primarily to reunite Soul with God, your consciousness with this inner consciousness, it&rsquo;s a reunification, it&rsquo;s a refamiliarizing yourself with something that you were once familiar with. In other words there was no time that you were never familiar with God and knew Its presence and every time you become re-exposed to It, It was also familiar to you, It&rsquo;s never new but the familiarity of It and the re-exposure to It is new because it&rsquo;s happening in a new body which you think is a new body for you. Audience: And your other consciousness of it is blanked out&hellip; Adano: Right and thank God for inventing forgetfulness. If you don&rsquo;t thank It for inventing that how would you get a beautiful experience of a new (inaudible). Audience: Isn&rsquo;t there enough that remains that when it does happen it sort of begins to bring back an awareness of it, increases the joy of the thing so that there&rsquo;s an instinctive want for more of it. Adano: Right this is true, this is happening to us, it&rsquo;s an amazing thing what happens to us when we realize it. Now the thing is that the Masters want us to explore our real nature, this is something that we don&rsquo;t seem to want, we&rsquo;d rather not explore our inner nature to know who we are in case we don&rsquo;t want to accept what we are. Now the second reason why we don&rsquo;t want to explore our inner nature is that we may not have any control because we are still limited creatures in a certain sense. Now another reason why we don&rsquo;t want to explore is that you don&rsquo;t know what to expect. Now your greatest enemy in this universe is not the devil, the greatest enemy in this world is being uninformed because once you&rsquo;re informed you have no fear no more. Audience: Well that&rsquo;s what they say, things that you know about you don&rsquo;t fear. Adano: So the devil, what is he? If you were informed on him, what fear have you got for him but you&rsquo;re uninformed with God, this is the peculiarity, just as much you&rsquo;re uninformed as to what this so-called devil is if it does exist you see. 2:00 Being uninformed is the real problem in the human consciousness all the time. Audience: And that isn&rsquo;t going to arise too much out of book learning and so much&hellip; Adano: It does not come from books, if it could come from books then you take all the libraries and sit down and read it. So the Sages then had to come up with a way to get back into Man and They tried prayer as a stepping stone, not that prayer was the ultimate process, it was a stepping stone. Then they found that that was not enough because sooner or later Man got so involved with it, he made long rotary prayers you know and even went to the extent he made sticks and all kind of banners to make his prayer mechanical, so he lost the concept, then they found that evolution of consciousness must come on. The next step went to analysis and reason, &ldquo;Why do I have to pray?&rdquo; In other words I&rsquo;m getting a little smarter now than my fellow Man, so that is the next level we start analyzing, analyzing, and we analyze and we analyze till reach a point that there is no more analysis because it seems like a dog chasing its tail with the analysis, we&rsquo;re never getting anywhere. Then comes along someone will who says we should try meditation. Now why we should try meditation, only because he seemed to solve some of the problems that most people have with the least amount of effort on his part. Now some people look at those individuals and says, &ldquo;Gee he&rsquo;s got the luck of the Irish or he&rsquo;s wearing some four leaf clover or something. He&rsquo;s always lucky, he&rsquo;s never in a scrape, back him up to the wall and he seems to get out.&rdquo; It is not that he has luck or anything, he has discovered by stop analyzing and slowly quieting his consciousness for a brief moment, he can think more objectively, he can think constructively for the first time, in other words he can channel his thoughts for the first time. Therefore he is seeking a medium, a measurement, to be one with truth for the first time. Now he starts to meditate and he discovers by that attitude certain things that have been there all the time from childhood up to that moment but you never realized they were there. One he discovers that he&rsquo;s calm, he&rsquo;s more collective. Two he discovered that there is a inner light that flows within his brain. Three he discovers there is music in the atmosphere that he normally doesn&rsquo;t recognize was there. Now four he discovers an extended awareness of things around him that he did not normally recognize were there. In other words he seemed to step into time a split second ahead of his fellow Man in awareness. This makes him conscious now that there must be something for meditation, then he&rsquo;s caught up in a &ldquo;is it good or bad?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is what I&rsquo;m doing evil or is it&hellip;?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s got that guilt complex coming right now. So he starts looking for friends to talk to but there aren&rsquo;t too many friends that he can tell this experience to because they themselves never had it. Now those that he would meet who would talk about it don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because they would think they&rsquo;re all nuts. So spiritual people have very few friends but religious people have lots of friends because they can take the Bible and dissect it from cover to cover and debate in rhetoric all over the whole thing and have friends but a spiritual person can&rsquo;t have because Kenny walked over and said last night when he sat down to meditate uh, &ldquo;Myrtle did you see the blue light, did you see the red light, did you see&hellip;?&rdquo; And you say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get any Sister June or Brother Smith, I didn&rsquo;t get any.&rdquo; Audience: Are you sure we shouldn&rsquo;t call him (inaudible). Adano: Right, you see? It&rsquo;s very hard to communicate something that&rsquo;s happening inside of you because it&rsquo;s too individualistic, too personal yet there is a common link. We must see if the common link exists for us and there is the common link, the common link is that every time you attempt to meditate you feel a sense of peace, joy, and a widening awareness of yourself. When I use the word &ldquo;a widening awareness of yourself,&rdquo; I am saying that there is a tremendous intensity vibrating out of your being to think, to understand, to feel and react, and that this is infinitely flowing stronger, pulsating more and more with greater momentum every second that you widen this awareness. This is a big difference because you&rsquo;re starting to see the infinite unlimited source of your consciousness, that is there all the time pulsating, then you can go in and merge with it. Now, so someone will say to you &ldquo;All right, meditation is good, could you illustrate it to us?&rdquo; Well to illustrate meditation to someone you&rsquo;re stuck. Audience: Yeah because this is something (inaudible). Adano: Right, but you&rsquo;ve got a way to give some external action and that is &ldquo;gesture.&rdquo; By gesture you can communicate your consciousness or the mood of your consciousness that you&rsquo;re in and it&rsquo;s through that we can have some common bond. Now those who have seen this gesture, the placing of two palms together, thumb, the four fingers together like that and place it right over the heart and slightly closing the eyes, what would that communicate to us in this room? Audience: That someone is praying. Adano: You give it a label, a simple mechanical action and I in my mind may call you all sorts of names, do you see? You don&rsquo;t really say that my gesture tells you what my consciousness all the time, so when you say somebody is sit down meditating, it doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s really meditating, this is what you got to realize. Audience: Somebody can come in like this and have evil in their heart. Adano: All right but we will do something else now. If we close our eyes for a brief moment but do not fall asleep because closing the eyes does have a tendency to make you sleepy or drowsy and you don&rsquo;t want to fall asleep, you want to be aware, that means you want to be awake but at the same time you want to experience this condition of having closed eyes and not falling asleep. Now to experience something in that gesture is an expansion of awareness, it&rsquo;s an expansion of something that you never experienced before, it&rsquo;s an experience that is new and is going to have certain rewards that is it&rsquo;s going to widen your understanding of yourself and the feeling reaction of yourself. Audience: Because of the fact that in this with the eyes closed there&rsquo;s nothing to distort or to disturb your thinking process and so it turns inward and you are aware of the inner goings on. Adano: Good. Now so we will try the same gesture now&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1965---volume-3-sat-guru">1965 - Volume 3 Sat Guru</h2>
<p>Adano65_Vol3_SatGuruQ1RRNW6 - Because how is God working in subtle ways? He is working as the vital life force, the vital awareness of human beings, for human beings. Therefore God is in Man already, but Man cannot recognize it, he can only feel it. He can&rsquo;t see it, but when he feels it, it is that condition of feeling that impinges on the consciousness for him to act. It makes him act in a more refined, a more sane, sanitary way and actually a non-destructive way. This is what really works with him. See now one of the strangest things about meditation is that once you break into this consciousness, you can go into it. It is in there alone that the whole library of the Universe and its laws of creation come out. When a man said that he found some new invention, he didn&rsquo;t find it by reading in a book you know, he pondered upon it and by pondering upon it the superconsciousness or the intuitive nature came down with the idea from that realm and then he saw that idea and then he tried to impress that idea in the geometrical or the mathematical form and from that mathematical form or blueprint he tries now in a simple way and sometimes in a complicated way to take fixed structural matter to put it together and each year he has got to keep making a new model of it, you see, but the idea is still there. It&rsquo;s just like the automobile, the original automobile in Henry Ford&rsquo;s brain is still there as he saw what it was, he saw the unique engine, then when he sought to put it down in the mathematical form then he started to take metal and mold it, he saw the inadequacy of the physical thing in relation to the perfect thing he is seeing there, so every year there&rsquo;s a constant refinement to get to the perfect thing, but it goes on you see. Meditation is to keep us always going to the perfection, it is to keep us to go in more and more, so there is no end, that&rsquo;s the beautiful part of it. Now, in meditation we are gonna run into a peculiar problem, there are certain things that occur that appear to duplicate at times this divine law and these are the functions of the mind too, it imitates at times. Now those who are acquainted with the youth movement of using acid or you call it the psychedelic experience, they do have a certain extension of awareness but that extension of awareness is not coming from the superconsciousness, it&rsquo;s coming strictly from the subconsciousness because the subconsciousness is a reservoir already of that superconsciousness, it&rsquo;s a mirror. So inside of it that subconsciousness has all these things stored up already as a replica of the superconsciousness, but it cannot add more to it unless the superconsciousness feeds it, you follow? So when the person takes acid or mescaline or any type of psychedelic agent, he only reassess the subconscious and its mechanics but he&rsquo;s not adding anything new but because he has never experienced this mechanics, this total condition from an objective state in a waking state, it is totally new to him and it will fit all that he knows about himself to a certain degree until there is a lack of inspiration coming in, there&rsquo;s a lack of inventiveness coming in, there&rsquo;s a lack of self-discovery coming in, &ldquo;where is the other part, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; then he started running dry then you need another booster and the more you take the booster what you&rsquo;re really doing, you&rsquo;re only mapping out your subconscious mind over and over, you&rsquo;re going over the same territory over and over. Now yet in a real genuine super conscious awakening, in that light one may see certain forms of different human beings in different ages and in different style costume. This is the first time they are experiencing different life forms of themselves, that Man has always been alive, that the Divine Life has no end, it only seeks to manifest in forms, human form, and in this awareness you can open your eyes and close it and it&rsquo;s still there. It goes in, sometimes you can see yourself as an Indian Chief, you see yourself as some rich potentiate sitting down in Saudi Arabia with a big harem, it all depends on what level of consciousness you go in. Talking about that I would like you to locate a National Geographical magazine October 1958, there&rsquo;s something in there I want you to see if you can locate a National Geographic Magazine 1958. But in our cells we see these different forms of our past lives, we can see the different forms of our past lives and the levels that we&rsquo;ve dropped and levels that we&rsquo;ve risen to, this occurs in there. Now a Master comes along and can do it for you too, it isn&rsquo;t that a Man does not get a Master to take him up there, as I say it&rsquo;s the greatest relationship to find a Master, but the Master is not going to do the work all the time for you, a Master is not going to coddle you, a Master is only going to act as an insurance policy against certain repercussions. In other words a Master&rsquo;s consciousness is total, like an insurance policy for a hundred thousand bucks and you&rsquo;re paying up this you know, the payments, so you start making your first down payment, you got a long way to pay up for a hundred thousand dollars. So you may kick the bucket and you haven&rsquo;t paid up your money or insurance and it&rsquo;s no good. Well the problem with insurance policy is that you don&rsquo;t collect your insurance when you die, you always got to leave this insurance for somebody else, whereas with a Master He&rsquo;s your insurance policy and He never kicks the bucket and leave you behind not to collect. When He kicks the bucket you&rsquo;re still collecting on the Master, you see, but the Master really doesn&rsquo;t kick the bucket in the sense we&rsquo;re talking about, His consciousness has taken yours into tow. In other words you have docked into His consciousness already, you&rsquo;re locked into His consciousness and no matter where you drift in yours, no matter what undertow you go in your attitude, in your behavior, in the emotional tones of your behavior, and your gestures with your fellow Man and yourself, you are still locked into His, He cannot let you go away, He pulls you in all the time. Now as one Master was saying, if you go into a foreign city you would avail yourself of the services of a tourist guide who is well acquainted with that city and take you around and show you the town, in super consciousness or cosmic consciousness would be the most practical thing to avail yourself of a Man who&rsquo;s been there all the time right? So that is one of the advantages of that type of spiritual insurance, this is an insurance policy that pays off, pays off in either level, either in a level you&rsquo;re in the body, or the level that you leave the body, it pays off with that association, you know who you&rsquo;re dealing with you see. 0:10 Now Saints are considered such an insurance policy, that&rsquo;s why certain religions may their devotees concentrate on a particular Saint&rsquo;s picture or Saint&rsquo;s body form to impregnate the consciousness, that they have something familiar to latch onto, to travel in consciousness, but we realize that Man is made of flesh and blood and there&rsquo;s a very little warmth and affinity with marble even when he pays a devotion to it but there&rsquo;s also respect for that marble form, yet when he sees a human form to which this particular quality is endowed in, he has an animosity, &ldquo;Can that be really true?&rdquo; Then start comparison, he starts comparing him with one who is in mable or one who is in a painting you know, he cannot see the relationship until he goes inside and find out now that this living one, this one in the physical form, can really work from inside for him then he turns the awareness to that particular Teacher or that particular Master but until that time he&rsquo;s gonna to do it. He&rsquo;s not going to able to look up to Him, a living Master, as a guide because he&rsquo;s too preconditioned by the marble form of one past Saint or a painting of a past Saint, you see. Now seeing a human form communicating that identical information and that identical experience and now encouraging him to make the journey in, this is something he can&rsquo;t accept right away because he&rsquo;s still thinking in terms of his human standards, how does Man maintain himself? What are these values and so forth? What are their you know emotions? These are things are gonna to come up. Now you can look at the statue of Saint joseph or Virgin Mary or Saint Thomas or Jesus and right away you you have the reverence only because their stature, their qualities, have already been established and is put down on paper to be recited like a sort of a rotation now you know and therefore the reference is there.Now to see a human form with these qualities that are being written about, living, it&rsquo;s hard to make the transfer because you cannot see qualities, you have to be constantly exposed day in and day out, you have to have inner relationships with that human form to see so many different experiences occur for you to realize that it&rsquo;s happening, this is a peculiar thing. Now some Masters you sit in their presence you see nothing, feel nothing, and they&rsquo;re doing a whole lot for you, like one reporter that went to see the Maharishi, that&rsquo;s the you know the Beatles Guru, the Guru of the Beatles, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He teaches the same thing, meditation, he told the reporter he said, &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sitting here all the time but I don&rsquo;t see anything, I haven&rsquo;t got anything out of you. All I&rsquo;ve seen is somebody come here and everyone is looking for some word, some magic formula to find peace. I haven&rsquo;t found anything.&rdquo; Audience: And this is a reporter&rsquo;s comment? Adano: And the Maharishi says, &ldquo;Well you may not have found what you were looking for but I sure gave it to you already.&rdquo; See? Now how does the reporter know what he was really looking for? When a Master tells him He already gave him what he was looking for and he can&rsquo;t recognize it. Audience: &ldquo;Before you asked I answered.&rdquo; Adano: Now this reporter certainly is going to go searching again all over till he finds some other individual and may make the same comment over and over and the remark to that comment may be the same thing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given it to you already.&rdquo; Not realizing what these men are saying until one day when he&rsquo;s so fed up, he eventually will latch on to someone or feel some affinity for someone and then realize that when he&rsquo;s getting it from this person, he&rsquo;s already done get it you know from all the rest of the same way but he couldn&rsquo;t recognize it. You see the Maharishi is saying meditation is simple, it&rsquo;s not a complex difficult thing, it is something that you take in strides like&hellip; Audience: Well it&rsquo;s complex from this standpoint, if you have never experienced it&rsquo;s still something that&rsquo;s unattainable and you don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re talking about. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced it you hardly know what the other fellow is talking about until you do experience it and then almost no words explain it it seems. Adano: Yes. Audience: It can sound&hellip; I know the first time I heard about meditation it was just so many words running through my mind and it bore no relation to anything that I could understand really and then after the first little teensy weensy bit of experience where you began to feel quiet and peaceful afterwards, when the first thing you know you do something that you&rsquo;re reminded that you&rsquo;ve done the wrong thing again and then you think &ldquo;well this was a thought that I had when I was quiet that time.&rdquo; Little things like this then you begin to realize that meditation is expanding this awareness within you almost without your knowing about it. Adano: Right. Audience: But it&rsquo;s a reality and then when he next listen to somebody talk, a few more of the words take root and grow and they mean something and after a while as you say you come to realization that it&rsquo;s all pretty simple process it seems like the hardest process is the undoing of the old concepts you had that it was complicated. Adano: Yes you see, put it this way, a good many of us in their own way have actually achieved the art of meditation, but can&rsquo;t recognize it. First let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re sitting down and you&rsquo;re just thinking, you&rsquo;ve been playing in the yard or running around then all of a sudden you&rsquo;re tired and you sit down and then you&rsquo;re looking on the trees and you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Well gotta go to school tomorrow, got my homework to do, gee whiz and they&rsquo;re going to the movies tonight,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re thinking but this is a physical restriction from age 0 to age 18 imposed upon us by society. So you&rsquo;re thinking and there are certain noises are going on and there are certain arguments and all, when you take off in your own little corner, sit down and you shut your eyes and you want to shut it out but then all of a sudden there&rsquo;s a peculiar feeling coming over. Well you feel cold or you feel warm and then you feel joy, you&rsquo;re stumbling right into meditation, you&rsquo;re being forced into the very source of yourself. Now because you can&rsquo;t recognize it, &ldquo;Get out of this room and start doing something. Come on prepare, wash the dishes, fiddle in the room. Did you clean up your room? Did you do your homework?&rdquo; Now let&rsquo;s put it in the adult scale, &ldquo;Got to get up to work tomorrow morning. Gee whiz the car ain&rsquo;t running, it&rsquo;s too cold outside. I should have fixed that washer,&rdquo; and all these things come piling in. Yet when a brief moment, a brief time you take to relax then again you seem to go back into it. Now someone comes along and tell you, &ldquo;Well you need to learn to meditate.&rdquo; This sounds like something weird, fantastic, all the time you were doing certain approaches or attempts to the thing already, having certain reactions to it, here&rsquo;s someone trying to put the thing&hellip; but if you recognize that you have been doing this thing and go back to it now with an understanding that nothing in the actual scheme of life is really going to alter, it is you who are making the changes within yourself to the scheme of life. Audience: This man that was talking to us the other night was telling us about that in trying to check whether some of their work was very fruit or how the work bore fruit he said, &ldquo;We examined success&hellip; (gap in tape) &hellip;this lower or inner levels of consciousness for his creative ideas you see and yet he didn&rsquo;t know this was what he was doing. I mean he didn&rsquo;t know it to the point where he could turn it on or off at will. 0:20 He always sort of, &ldquo;Well this always makes me feel good and I always have luck when I lean back, get my feet up on the table, and then kind of go off into a dream state,&rdquo; but he became successful nevertheless due to these periods. So I think it&rsquo;s the same thing with meditation, as you say some do it uh unconsciously and are getting results but don&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s what it is they&rsquo;re doing. Adano: Look, I made a mistake I should have said &ldquo;good many of us do it uninformed,&rdquo; not unconsciously there is no such thing as unconsciously, good many of us do it in an uninformed manner. Now the purpose of group gatherings or religious activity is to do it in an informed manner, not a formal way, to be informed on its mechanics and its purpose, its motivation and to take the utmost out of it because you have a choice. If you&rsquo;re uninformed eventually you&rsquo;re gonna find pain following it and you may find frustration following, if you are informed you are prepared to be immunized yourself against the frustration and the pain, you get a sort of spiritual immunity to it, you are prepared for its reactions, you know now that you are informed to what you&rsquo;re doing. You see this is what I&rsquo;m trying to bring out about meditation, by being informed in group meditation or individual meditation you are prepared for the various aspects as they occur and see now a Guru is with you and a Guru can be in another country at the same time. Now how are we going to tune in on the Guru? Audience: Well I&rsquo;m not convinced about the Guru having anything to do with me (inaudible). Audience: It maybe this this way, you learn to meditate the way you learn to bang around on the piano, but if you are in the presence and you know always when you&rsquo;re in the presence of someone who can really play it or can really do whatever it is including meditating. When you realize that you&rsquo;re in the presence of this teacher of meditation, whether you&rsquo;re here and he&rsquo;s 18,000 miles on the other side of the earth or whatever, when you hit the vibration point where you can become aware, &ldquo;when the student is ready, the Guru appears,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s no sense pushing it any further, there&rsquo;s no sense in saying that you might not learn a great deal from other people who are talking about the same thing. You may learn a great deal about how to listen to it. Now you&rsquo;ll learn good things and you&rsquo;ll learn bad things but when you come into the presence of that person who can really play it, then you will know and only then you will know that it&rsquo;s time for you to go and get lessons there and nowhere else and it may be that it won&rsquo;t be on this plane. Adano: Yes you see the thing, what you&rsquo;re saying is this, in meditation&hellip; let us bear in mind that we have to do the work ourselves. We have to be acquainted with the instrument we&rsquo;re working with and that&rsquo;s the human body, you can&rsquo;t trade it in and there is no u-turn on the road of life, it&rsquo;s a straight one way from birth to the next birth, whether you like it or not. Now there&rsquo;s no u-turn and it&rsquo;s a one-way run you know and you can&rsquo;t trade it in but someday we&rsquo;ll trade in a new heart for a new heart and we can change a leg into paddle you know, change your nose into a snorkel and have a parts bank you know, we know all these things will come along sometimes, but in the meantime the human body is marvelously built, don&rsquo;t want to change it, no matter how it looks. Now being acquainted with that is being informed as to what it is, being informed is allowing you to operate it. Now if you&rsquo;re not informed&hellip; Audience: Would you say allowing you to operate intelligently instead of&hellip; Adano: Yes all right, you want to operate this thing intelligently but you also don&rsquo;t want to make this operation a complicated, drawn out intellectual tussle with yourself because then it loses all proportions. Once you&rsquo;re informed that this mechanism functions a certain way by the scientists of the material world or by the spiritual scientist of the other world, once you&rsquo;ve got this information established there, then forget about the information, do the work. 0:25 Now to do the work is to take time out to practice, now regularity is important, now this one the hardest thing about meditation because regularity entails discipline, that&rsquo;s why the word is disciple, one who disciplines the five senses to the Divine Self or Guru-ship. God is the Guru all in a human body, the human body came along with full realization and meets another human being and introduces him to this divine principle and takes him through this process, but as long as you understand that information, we must now understand the information that is involving a personal action. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that one should not rely on the Guru or one should over rely on the Guru because these are faults in us, these are things we are going to do regardless of how we are trying to watch ourselves. We are going to be over relying on the Guru to do everything for us and in time is going to say well, &ldquo;Guru don&rsquo;t exist for me because He&rsquo;s not helping me,&rdquo; you see? &ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t solve my problem,&rdquo; in other words, I got $50 rent to pay and can&rsquo;t pay it, He&rsquo;s not solving my problem so Guru is to blame, it is just as to say God is to blame. We&rsquo;re trying to point out that in the approach to meditation the fundamental thing is that what this consciousness represents all the time to us, it represents to us all the time the Divine Creative Life. Once we keep this in mind we are never going to stray but if we have some other description of what this Divine Creative Life is going to be, we are bound to stray away into some fantasy but once we realize it&rsquo;s a Divine Creative Life and this Divine Creative Life has become us, then we will never suffer the fallacy of being separated from It, we will always maintain an affinity of oneness with It, we&rsquo;ll always know that the Divine God is always here, it&rsquo;s never somewhere else, it has become us. Now let me show you something, why It has become us and why this thing is so important to realize It as such. The scriptures state, &ldquo;God made Man in His own image and likeness, male and female created He them.&rdquo; Now if you read this from that vantage point you will think there was some little fellow way off with a fat tummy which is a symbol of prosperity, that&rsquo;s God got to be a prosperous individual, jovial and laughing and that&rsquo;s a sign of knowing what He&rsquo;s doing you know and He&rsquo;s going to create now, take a little bit of mud here a little bit of there, and you&rsquo;re going to make two individuals and push them out on their own. If you read the thing that way and try to understand that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;ll end up thinking of it all the time but if you try to understand the dimension in which it&rsquo;s involving you, then you will see something deeper. God made Man, that is to say this Creative Principle, this Creative Life Energy, slowed Itself down from a conscious flow to a crystallized object. You can&rsquo;t go any further than matter, you can only go back to pure consciousness, so how how thick is thick, you see what I mean? How solid is solid, you&rsquo;re solid already, you reached the state of solidity, you reached the state of fixation. In other words there is no hell, this is the hell, the final fixation of your&hellip; your freedom has been taken away and confined to dumb matter, you&rsquo;re confined to dumb flesh. In other words the thing has already stopped here, this is the final manifestation of the creation. Now it&rsquo;s all the levels preceding this is where where the realizations exist, the preceding qualities, is not where it stops, the preceding qualities. So the image is matter but that image is atomic, that means matter is an atomic principle. 0:30 Now energy is equal to the mass, this atomic mass, times the velocity of light squared. Now that Bible said at one time God made the light first and every Saint in the Bible said, &ldquo;No Man see God but saw the light.&rdquo; Now I&rsquo;m not talking of a little electrical light, the total cosmic light is light because all the atoms are composed out of it so we are seeing crystallized light, but we don&rsquo;t realize crystalized light until we try to manipulate it by our will. Now I can&rsquo;t move this crystallized light in the form of flesh unless I will to move it. If I wish my hand to come to the kneecap, I have to wish, that means I have to desire, there&rsquo;s a feeling to move it, there&rsquo;s a need, and if I move it I have to execute some form of energy. To execute some form of energy I have to breath, exhale or contract, and relax and in so doing I execute a law that is going on that I don&rsquo;t appreciate, but I take it for granted. I snap and kill a fly, I take that for granted you see, but look at what is happening to move it, what is involved in the thing. Good. Audience: A lot of principles are in action. Adano: Right, a lot of principles are in action and we don&rsquo;t realize these principles. Now this image is the universal image therefore we realize that this image has become us already by stopping at this particular level. Now where is the likeness of this image? The likeness of this image is the ability to move it, the ability to manipulate these laws or else we have no likeness in it. God, the Creative Intelligence, is manipulating all His laws and holding them in motion. Now, we say God is at rest but we must not confuse rest as meaning stop, we must realize that rest means total orbiting movement as a whole and as a total existing force, it&rsquo;s there at rest in its orbital movement already, it&rsquo;s not going to go out of its orbital movement unless they change their particular&hellip; You know, one out of a billion chances one object will go out of its orbit and come into another orbit, but they are all orbiting&hellip; Audience: To having had an idea, when that idea is pictured, your mind is at rest temporarily because the thing has been accomplished, it has accomplished its purposed and created a cake or a pie or a house or something like that and then the activity starts all over again with other ideas. Adano: Ok, let&rsquo;s look at it now. We know He has crystallized Himself as flesh, we know this because He has given us this capacity of self knowing. Now self knowing is one of the functions of self, but what part of this physical body is self? But this physical body knows, how it knows, why it knows, for what it knows for, He&rsquo;s stumped, this is the dilemma He&rsquo;s in. It knows though, so knowing doesn&rsquo;t belong to the body, so knowing is universally there as likeness, you see, it&rsquo;s a likeness unto us, we are likened to this principle that it knows. Now, it feels and reacts, what part of us can you say is doing it? There is none yet they all dovetail into this mechanism and this mechanism vibrates as a placid movement, it goes on all the time. Now, we then realize that there are only two aspects of this manifestation, a male / female aspect. Now, we also realize that we need help, we can&rsquo;t do it by ourselves. If we could do this thing by ourselves, everyone would be realized masters, they would not need in the first place any Master because, why we need help? God breathed into Man the Breath of Life and Man became a living Soul. Now He didn&rsquo;t say that Man became a living body, He didn&rsquo;t say Man became a living mind, He didn&rsquo;t say Man became a living spirit. It is specifically stated that man became a living Soul, not a dead one either and Breath of Life had to flow from some point, Breath of Life. Now what you feel when I go into that consciousness is the flow of life that is in all of us and you sense Soul, your own Soul you sense all the time, you sense your God-ness but you are unable to put a finger on it, it is very hard to pin it. You say &ldquo;well what part of it flows through this room, where?&rdquo; It is passing right through the wood, the stone, everything, it is passing into space all at the same time, that Soul consciousness is going on. Now, you are linked up into it, in other words every time you realize you are Soul that doesn&rsquo;t say you can remain totally realized there all the time in that consciousness, you drift back. You see you have a temporary realization you are Soul at times and until you become illumined that you are permanently Soul, then you remain a Soul, you see you know it for sure. Now, until that time it is temporary. There are times when you may go to sleep and have inner experiences and totally can&rsquo;t remember them when you wakeup, of the Soul&rsquo;s nature. Now even when you are asleep you cannot say &ldquo;Am I a man or am I a woman?&rdquo; You have no way to say it, there is no way you can pinpoint it. Yet you know that when you wake up and look at yourself this particular image, this particular form of the of the two types that this Creative Intelligence has slowed down to become, I am one of it. Now does that say that my type or my shape is restricted to eternity for this one? Is it possible then there is some way that I can have been the other shapes or many multiple interchangeable shapes, you see? Now realizing that meditation can bridge the gap, the Sages have come to us and that&rsquo;s where the need for the Guru. The Guru comes up to start us off, to bridge the gap, and that&rsquo;s why Jesus says, &ldquo;I have come that ye may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I have come that you may see God today.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have come that ye may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; God is life. Now who in the room can say he has more life abundantly? Is there anyone here&hellip; Audience: When you say life more abundantly&hellip; Adano: I don&rsquo;t mean material goods in the storehouse you know. Audience: I don&rsquo;t mean that, is this the consciousness of aliveness, the consciousness of alertness? Adano: Life more abundantly means that you are a citizen of two realms of existence, while being in this material realm confined to the physical form, you can vocate the form and go into that unlimited realm. &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing because I live and die daily in God,&rdquo; he was able to slip in and out of this mechanism. When I say slip in and slip out I mean his awareness opened up and allow him to see that another realm and traverse that other realm with a Master or a Great One and still come back into this realm and accept this realm. In other words you are familiar with the realms of existence, we came originally from a realm of pure consciousness which you may call me a ghost, in that realm I&rsquo;m a ghost I don&rsquo;t have a body, so brother ghost or sister ghost, we&rsquo;re all ghosts in that or we&rsquo;re all body-less entities you see. Now, yet memory is there, memory of the association with different body forms are there, you can&rsquo;t lose that. Now, so I shouldn&rsquo;t have no fear for a ghost because I am a ghost already and Thomas said, &ldquo;Am I seeing an apparition.&rdquo; &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not seeing an apparition, you&rsquo;re seeing a flesh and blood body. Come put your hand, feel these things.&rdquo; Yet this is a peculiar aspect of this flesh and blood body, to show you what is involved in Divinity, to show you what is involved in our evolution of life. We are not going back to ghostness because we came from the ghost world, we&rsquo;re going on to a higher level of body reality, that is a body that cannot decompose no more in nature. 0:40 It&rsquo;s a permanent manifestation of the law of life but this body exhibit of peculiarity, it casts no shadow therefore it permits light to reflect through it uninterrupted therefore it can be visible and yet invisible but that doesn&rsquo;t say it is empty space because if you take your hand and hit that body He is going to feel it, there is a body there now. For instance when Yukteswar came into the room to Yogananda after he passed through that phase, Yogananda took his physical arms, you know how big he was, and put it around that skinny Guru and apply a little pressure, you know he said, &ldquo;Come on son, you&rsquo;re squeezing too hard.&rdquo; You know he was feeling pain too you know so really it&rsquo;s there although that body can do many things, he was still&hellip; Audience: In a physical body. Adano: Right, now this is the thing that all the Masters are saying, we have to go to this form. We are walking from the lower level of God&rsquo;s image as matter through a higher level of God&rsquo;s image as light, to a permanent level of God&rsquo;s image as non-decaying matter. Now Star Trek, who has seen that TV show, is an illustration of what will happen mechanically in time that you can energize the body from here and change its rate of flow and put it in another position, this is what the Masters are doing all the time. The Masters of truth are Masters of manipulating the atomic law that constitute creation. Audience: (Inaudible) this business of making your body appear or disappear, going in and out, is fairly simple. It&rsquo;s a matter of changing molecular vibrations. Adano: Right. Now but meditation&hellip; all these laws seem so far-fetched and they seem so far out of our range at the present but it&rsquo;s not beyond the range of experience because those who had experiences along these lines will say you if you meditate you will go through it. It&rsquo;s a peculiar thing, you will experience these things through meditation. Audience: I&rsquo;d like to ask question, I&rsquo;ve always been confused to what extent is meeting a Guru or a Master or a teacher in the physical body necessary. Some some of the books I&rsquo;ve read indicate when the student is ready, the Master appears, others would indicate that you must meet a teacher in the physical body to help open these various centers. Is there any answer to that? Adano: Oh yes there&rsquo;s a very very very important answer to it, very important. You are familiar with this house right? You have an employee that works for you who have never been here before right? Were you just say to that employee, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the key to my house, go find me my notebook of last month&rsquo;s&hellip; I put it in one edition of the drawers,&rdquo; but you don&rsquo;t tell them what room you put it in and you don&rsquo;t tell them the color of the notebook but it&rsquo;s a notebook that&rsquo;s very important for her to make a sale, what is the confusion of that person when they come here? All right, now if you give them a written description of your house and that the same thing is written down, you didn&rsquo;t speak with them, you wrote the thing down and left it, is the confusion greater? Audience: They can&rsquo;t find it. Adano: Right now but if you as a human being specifically describe it to them, what would they do? Would they go specifically to one spot and pick it out? That&rsquo;s the need for a living Guru. He&rsquo;s specific as to where He is going because He&rsquo;s already there in that specific form but we don&rsquo;t appreciate Him because we don&rsquo;t see the the control of His existence in that form. We only appreciate the Guru when He leaves the physical frame. He does more for us when He leaves a physical frame but only to those who He has been associated with. For instance I&rsquo;ll show you. The employee has associated with you and she knows how you talk and what you do and you have to go away to Houston on business. The employee, knowing your habits, will begin to think how you would act under certain conditions and thereby follow your pattern of thinking to solve problems, see what I mean. Now, when the Guru leaves the physical frame, the student starts to think but the Guru hasn&rsquo;t gone away because the Guru would come in on another link, the Guru will come in on another level. In other words you can keep tabs on your employee by telephone now one of these are picture phones, you can keep tabs. So she&rsquo;s still seeing your face but it&rsquo;s still communication going on and if there&rsquo;s any problem you&rsquo;re still maintaining contact. It&rsquo;s the same thing is going to happen with the disciple that she doesn&rsquo;t have to see you physically but the mere voice and the mirror of that picture phone making contact with her or a TV thing doing it, she&rsquo;s going to make contact with you. So the Guru is still there you see but she knows you. Now let&rsquo;s say I dress up like you and I paint myself up and put on and I start talking to her. For a while she may think I am you but then she may trip me up with certain information that I may not know of you, you get it? See so the important thing is to find a living Guru to which you have met or associated and this is one way of going in. Now the Master came and He said there were five Masters of realization that were involved in Self-realization, He said Babaji, Jesus, Lahiri, Yukteshwar, and himself. It is very possible that we may never know what physical form Jesus really has, it&rsquo;s possible we may not know the physical form, Yukteswar has except those who have lived at a time with Him, it&rsquo;s very possible we may not know Yogananda&rsquo;s form except those who were with Him. We have photographs or Lahiri Mayasha&rsquo;s form, yet it is possible to know Babaji&rsquo;s form because He hasn&rsquo;t gone nowhere yet you see, even we are here, His form is possible and we have a picture of Him form in which we can relate to. Now when the disciple is initiated it is not if he&rsquo;s initiated by another disciple of a Master, it is not the disciple who really initiates you. If he was the person who&rsquo;s really initiating you then we can say we don&rsquo;t need no Master or we need a physical Master but who really initiates? Is it disciple who initiates, is it the Guru of human form that initiates or is it God the Divine Principle flowing through both the so-called Guru and the so-called disciple that does the initiation? Who does the initiation? Audience: The God Principle. Adano: The God Principle, until this linkage is realized we will still think of the form, we will still need the form, the form is a stepping stone to the formless. It is the formless that makes this Divine Life impersonal, it frees us from the limitations of it you see. Now moses had a simple illustration of it. &ldquo;What is your name God? Because here I&rsquo;m going to go down to these people and initiate them into the truth of You, Your existence, the reality of You but these people are accustomed to calling You by names so I got to give them some name.&rdquo; So hearing his own consciousness working inside he said, &ldquo;God what is your name?&rdquo; And the name that was more appropriate that could ever given back was, &ldquo;I AM that I AM.&rdquo; Now you go tell a group of people who be accustomed to calling their God Taurus or Jupiter or Jehovah that God&rsquo;s name now is I AM that I AM, what they gonna with you, they&rsquo;ll try and tar and feather you, you understand? Because he had reached beyond the point of worshiping the personal aspect of God and realizing God as a total self now, that God in the total self had to give him an impersonal answer, the I AM-ness of his own higher self was the truth. 0:50 Now, a layman caught in it cannot comprehend that, a layman who has been accustomed to looking up to some personal form needs a personal form. Another way, a lion needs a bigger lion to worship, a cow needs a bigger cow to worship, and a human being sure needs another human being to look up to until he can reach that understanding that none of these forms is the end or the limitation of the truth, it is a stepping stone to the truth. Now the Guru eventually doesn&rsquo;t imply that He&rsquo;s a Master all the time when you start to go into that inner realm, I&rsquo;m certain the Guru at one point beholds you as brother or an elder brother with the form and then the time comes when the Guru has no form and then you go running, &ldquo;Where are you Guru, you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo; And then all this but light and you find yourself lost in light and you realize, &ldquo;Jee whiz Guru was carrying me all this way by my nose till I was able to walk on my own.&rdquo; Then I realized, &ldquo;Guru is my elder brother when He was in the form but Guru is God now because I have realized the God-ness of Guru because the God-ness is me too.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s there we start to see the the common bond, we see the the even-ness of the thing. The Guru gives us strength, It gives us the fortitude by being in a human form only for that reason, that we don&rsquo;t assume that we know what this God principle is on its own. We need that physical form as a reminder&hellip; Audience: a kind of a focus of our safety. Adano: Right well let me show you another more deeper relationship in this Guru relationship. Guru is Soul, I said before God made Man and Man became a living Soul when God breathed breath of life into Man, Man became a living Soul, not a body, not a body. Remember you cannot look at the Guru as body now, remember this is the big fallacy of the thing, why a physical Guru or non-physical Guru. God breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul. Now as long as Man continues to believe he HAS a Soul, he will not realize God, he will always think God is something separate from him, he will always think God has made him, God is punishing him, God is rewarding him, and before you know he will kill his God and bury it too. You know &ldquo;God is dead,&rdquo; we might as well perform the ceremonial rights of it now or the funeral rights. So Man has reached a point where he is already saying that himself now because Man is living under the uninformed condition that he is Soul, he&rsquo;s not informed that he&rsquo;s Soul, he&rsquo;s living that he has a Soul you see. He&rsquo;s living under an impression that he has a Soul he doesn&rsquo;t think he is Soul. Now, yet God does not leave His creation, that is his own nature, to flounder because then it will fall apart. If you have an object and it starts to break away gradually and you don&rsquo;t take care of it, before you know disintegrate. Now if this is humanly true you mean to tell me Creative Intelligence that holds this universe is not going to do the same thing too? It has to find a way to maintain Its polarity, It has to find a way, It has to set up the laws to compensate Itself, It&rsquo;s already done this, we call it the redeeming principle but it&rsquo;s only a law of polarity bringing back itself, maintaining itself. That doesn&rsquo;t say to we don&rsquo;t need the Redeemer, we are looking at the term in a poetical statement but we must also look at the term and in a more objective Divine Law of truth. We need to be redeemed but don&rsquo;t look at it as something bad you know or something detrimental, we need to be pulled back, all right. So he knows that His creative power will diminish if it continues to live under the illusion or the impression that it has Soul because He endowed it already with the power to choose and to abuse that power of choice, so how is he going to prevent disintegration of His nature? By establishing the redeeming principle or the recompensation or the regenerating condition of His own nature, He has to establish that long before He started to create. Before you start to do something you&rsquo;re busy thinking, &ldquo;How long can I maintain this, how long can I keep it, how long can I look after it?&rdquo; So we say &ldquo;insecurity is the game we live by&rdquo; and God is insecure because He needs our love and this is true, this is the only thing He cannot get back from this dumb flesh. He made it marvelous, the birds chirp to indicate they love God, the trees sway and give fruit to say they love God, but Man will curse or a Man may swear and Man may eventually chant that he loves God too, he knows this problem. Now I&rsquo;m saying this that realizing this principle, God already as the Father cannot involve Himself in His creation no more, He&rsquo;s slow down into the creation so He has to generate another nature within this creation to maintain it, which is a recompensing nature, a redeeming nature. Out of that we got the second quality SUN but don&rsquo;t use it as s-o-n, you know. We always think &ldquo;because my offspring therefore he is the boss of the house now&rdquo; but you know we always think that way. It&rsquo;s like the Jewish Man says &ldquo;I got a son he became a Christian.&rdquo; The Rabbi says &ldquo;Yeah I got a son he became a Christian.&rdquo; They went to pray and the Jehovah says &ldquo;You two got problem? I got one, he&rsquo;s a Christian too.&rdquo; You see there&rsquo;s the problems we&rsquo;re having in our life. Now the redeeming principle of total creation manifests itself as a sun, that&rsquo;s a bright brilliant light, the light that shineth in Man, no Man comprehends, the darkness don&rsquo;t comprehend it, the light that shines within us. Now once a human form realizes this light and its true nature, the bondage is broken, the bonds are broken and Soul manifest and he realizes a heritage, that individual realizes a responsibility, not to himself, it&rsquo;s a responsibility to the manifested creation that is existing around him, that&rsquo;s the response. In other words it&rsquo;s not that we are not our brother&rsquo;s keeper, we are our brother&rsquo;s keeper, that&rsquo;s the whole problem but uh no one wants to accept the implications of being a brother&rsquo;s keeper, too much responsibility and only a Master can assume this responsibility because He has come home to the Soul nature, He is Soul now, He is free. He is suffering, He is speaking all our ideas and inspirations through us already. Audience: Well He has also reached from from the mortal to the immortal. Adano: Right this is established in His nature. In other words He has reached the two qualifications of God that has manifested in matter. The one manifestation of atomic mass or atomic control and the other manifestation the total likeness that is not impeded, there is no limitation now, these two things fluctuate in Him or flow in Him. Now He is Soul, He knows this beyond all doubt because He sees it all the time, it&rsquo;s not something that comes to Him for a brief moment, it&rsquo;s not something that comes to Him in lapse of dreams, it&rsquo;s something that He&rsquo;s totally aware of all the time, He is Soul. Then he sees the responsibility, then He realizes why Jesus said &ldquo;Father forgive them for they know not what they do.&rdquo; Now if we knew that we were Soul, what forgiveness have we got coming to us? We got any forgiveness coming to us if we knew we were Soul and made a mistake? All right but since you don&rsquo;t know, a Master has to forgive you, a more evolved individual has to forgive you for all you do to Him. Now if you are Soul in the first place when you recognize you&rsquo;re Soul, it&rsquo;ll be highly impractical, impossible nearby, for you to go contrary to the laws of creation you see. 1:00 Therefore there will be no need for forgiveness, for forgiveness does not exist in the Soul in the true sense of the word, you get it? Because what is there to forgive because you are Soul, you cannot do wrong, you are total righteousness, you are total truth, there is nothing wrong in Soul, Soul has nothing to forgive. Audience: Soul is God. Adano: Right but Man living under the illusion that he has this Soul, needs inspiration, he needs a reminder, that&rsquo;s why a Guru comes. A Guru comes as a reminder and it&rsquo;s a relationship between him, the Guru lifts him out of the one level to make him conscious that he is Soul. Now, but the Guru must come in a human form, He cannot come in no other form. Audience: I agree. Adano: What other form&hellip; if a Guru came from the astral realm like a TV picture out of the atmosphere and crystallize Himself in the room and spoke and you not knowing who He is, you&rsquo;re gonna do one of two things, either you gonna fall down and faint, or you gonna take off, you see? Well I&rsquo;m certain He would never stay in that room. Audience: You know the funny thing to me (inaudible). Adano: He&rsquo;s not going to stay in that room, you would faint or take off. Now if you are familiar, this person is familiar to you and He manifests to you, then there is an association that&rsquo;s been there, you see? Now Gurus don&rsquo;t act that way because it would be detrimental to this psychic nature. Now what Gurus do they take the human form to bring about the evolution of the human behavior, removing the wrong information that this mechanism has Soul to make it aware that it IS Soul, that is their obligation. They see this responsibility to Their fellow Man, They are Their brother&rsquo;s keeper. Why are They Their brother&rsquo;s keeper? Because Their brother, that&rsquo;s me, lives under the illusion I have a Soul, therefore I need that Guru. Until He plucks me out from this illusion that I am Soul, I got to be plucked out from the fact that I don&rsquo;t have a Soul but I AM Soul. Now to take illustration, a lioness one day was running you know, she was pregnant and she was chasing some goats and in the heat of the chase she fell down and died but at the same time gave birth to baby lion. The goats and the sheep all came around and the mother sheep, it&rsquo;s only natural for them all to gravitate, it&rsquo;s a human maternal feeling. They gathered in the orphan lion into their fold and he grew up with them eating grass and crying like a sheep, bah, bah, and ate grass and grew to a full grown lion not knowing the difference. One day a lion came down from the hill and saw the sheep all grazing there and he let out a big huge roar, telling the world that he is lion and all the sheep are familiar with that roar from past lives or genetic action, took off for the hills and the little big lion that lived among them, the sheep lion as he think he is, took off with them too. So the lion who looked in the crowd couldn&rsquo;t figure out why another lion like himself is running from him, so he gave chase not on the sheep, he gave chase to the lion and he chased the lion until he caught up with the lion and the lion almost gave out with fright and he caught him and he held his head and he dragged him to the river and he said, &ldquo;Hey you, look at yourself in the water and see what you are. You&rsquo;re not sheep, you&rsquo;re a lion,&rdquo; but he would have almost died from the exhaustion and the tussling and pulling him there that he was ready to die, he&rsquo;s already given up. So from a sheer last look he took a deep breath and he says, &ldquo;Well now roar like a lion, I say you roar like a lion&rdquo; and he started to give chase to the sheep. That&rsquo;s the same thing with Man and Soul, that&rsquo;s the same thing with Guru / disciple relationship. The Guru shakes us up, He grabs us by the neck, takes us through the various levels of existence to see reality as it is, to see God in us. We need the physical Guru and we need contact with the Gurus in the various levels. Now for instance Guru can come to you in a form of a written book and they are associated by the initiations. Now in this highest school of awareness He may not necessarily be the Guru for you to take you on to the various levels of inner consciousness, there may be another Guru whose responsibility is supposed to take you another step, it&rsquo;s like a school, let&rsquo;s put it this way, it&rsquo;s like a school. Up to a certain level you have one teacher or one Guru action, up to another level you have another Guru action and on another level there is no Guru but God and you. Now this is happening to us but we don&rsquo;t see it yet so we take on a physical Guru and through life and death He takes us up all the way up to the highest consciousness and He takes us to that level where you see yourself as a Son of God, a radiant light of God. Now He has already established His Son-ship, He&rsquo;s already established His Soul nature then at that moment He&rsquo;s your brother but you do not lose the respect because you have already discovered that He is you, that you and I are both lions now, we don&rsquo;t lose the respect you understand, you still respect the source of climb but you see you have now not the personal association, it&rsquo;s the impersonal association because the whole thing becomes impersonal. In fact as you look around every face in this room you see your Guru and everyone who has got a Guru will see it. If you have a Guru and you look around everyone here&rsquo;s face is your Guru, his Guru he will see and everyone in this room will see Guru in all our faces and at the same time they will see the Gurus and Gurus of all. So what are we seeing? We are only seeing God manifesting His infinite wonder of keeping us entertained. So we don&rsquo;t place a limit on God, you see the thing is this, the human Guru is important and having Him in a living form and is important, but coming through any contact with a disciple and the Guru&hellip; the important thing is this, each one of us has a Guru, we may not recognize Him right away but He will come and reveal Himself to us. Now remember one time I said to you if you were dealing with the Shell station to service your car and you had a Shell service card and you&rsquo;re out on the freeway somewhere and your car broke down and nearby that freeway where the car broke down there are five different service stations but no Shell and you&rsquo;re approximately 50 to 60 miles away, ask yourself the honest truth, would you get on the phone and call your Shell man to bring a tow car to take it in and fix your car? Why you wouldn&rsquo;t do it? Audience: Well I think I would get by with one of the other ones. Adano: Now this is true, each man&rsquo;s Guru is there but the Guru doesn&rsquo;t always impose His life upon you, not every time you sit down and meditate the Guru is gonna come there all the time. The Guru comes at the Divine Will and in the time you need it and He exposes you to many other things of other individuals to force certain information to help you along the path, to reinforce your confidence in the Guru. In other words those other gas stations will reinforce your confidence in your Shell station man, it reinforces it you see. 1:10 Now having a physical Guru is like as I said the only true relationship that can exist because your parents cannot assume the full responsibility of working out your Soul nature, it&rsquo;s not possible, they are not evolved, they are not enlightened to do it. Now here is an illustration, the Man who wrote the Bhagavad-Gita Vyasamuni had his son, his name was Sakuntala and before he was born right in the mother&rsquo;s womb he was taught the entire Bhagavad-Gita by his Father through sleep therapy, sleep learning. You know this is nothing new because it&rsquo;s the same old principle you just make machines to do it today easier like we make our machines for our prayer. He spoke to the mother with his consciousness and taught the child, the child was born he was able to parrot out the whole Bhagavad-Gita. The child realizing his Father to be a highly evolved Man, the child asked his Father to grant him initiation, the light, show him the light inside, let him take that inner&hellip; and the Father says &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not your Guru.&rdquo; Now this Man had many disciples of his own apart from his son being born and fully evolved to a certain extent. He sends him to another Man, a king, in some remote area and told him that is your Guru. He arrives at the court and what do he see? A king with a big harem enjoying himself, drinking, dancing, smoking and this is supposed to be the Guru. Now what a false concept or what a true concept is the Guru? Is the Guru a Man who drinks or is Guru is a Man who kneels down and pray? Answer the question now. The Father, a fully evolved man, does not assume the responsibility to be the Guru of his own child, sends them to someone who he knows from a higher nature is the Guru and when the boy arrives he sees a Man surrounded with beautiful women, he&rsquo;s drinking and smoking and dancing. Now if the the boy according to what he&rsquo;s been trained of a Guru or taught of a Guru, now the question is is a Guru a Man who drinks, smokes, or is he a Man that prays. Now if you&rsquo;re the son of this great sage what would be your decision: to choose the Guru or accept the Guru or whether the Guru says I&rsquo;m your Guru. Don&rsquo;t you see what a condition you want to put yourself through now? Because you cannot recognize the Guru right away no matter if you think you have found the Guru if you do not know, you have to have the inner experiences that will come after to tell you, not the outward experience is going to tell you that it&rsquo;s the Guru, that relationship is there. Now the boy automatically refused to accept such a Man as a Guru because he knows the Guru is a holy Man. This is the fallacy of this Soul or who believes that he has a Soul, see that&rsquo;s the big fallacy, by believing you have a Soul you automatically assume the Guru is a holy Man but if you are Soul the mere gazing upon that Man would tell you that Man is Guru or not Guru, you see? The light would be there, it would be shining in that man&rsquo;s forehead, you would see the light, &ldquo;let your light so shine before Men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven,&rdquo; though you may be a drunkard. Not necessarily who sits in the cell praying and rolling his beads, the light is shining through him, the light may be in him maybe all darkness, you see what I mean, light has to really emanate out of that being. Now the Guru is coming to the boy and now he tells the boy&hellip; the boy doesn&rsquo;t accept him first you see, and he goes away, he goes back to his Father and tells his Father, he actually rebukes his Father. Here&rsquo;s one time where the junior now is assaulting the adult, which is happening today&hellip; (gap in tape) &hellip; Sakuntala is looking at the fire and it&rsquo;s approaching these holy books that he&rsquo;s cherished, that his Father left him, and all these things, he&rsquo;s got a little bundle so he took off one of the wraps from his neck and he started hitting the fire, just not to come close to his books and the king looked at him and burst out laughing, &ldquo;look who is a materialist, look who calls himself a God Man, you&rsquo;re more materialistic than me. You criticized me for being materialistic, well looks who&rsquo;s materialistic!&rdquo; &ldquo;Here you are with a bundle of a few old books and you&rsquo;re busy trying to save it from burning and I am not even worried about the whole castle and you criticize me in your mind&rsquo;s eye, I&rsquo;m a Man of women, I drink and smoke and other things.&rdquo; He looked around and he clapped his hands and he stopped the fire. He looked around and he clapped his hand and everything went back in its original place. The disciple looked up and he realized, &ldquo;Well this is no ordinary individual no more.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t doing this merely to impress the boy you understand, he wasn&rsquo;t doing that merely to impress the boy that he was a Guru, because the Guru has life and death at His control because He&rsquo;s a Master, He&rsquo;s realized, He&rsquo;s God in human form working, Soul in human form working. It is because he wanted that boy to rid his consciousness of the fact that he has a Soul. Now after the boy realized what was going on, he didn&rsquo;t perform no more miracles for that boy, you know what he made that boy do? He made that boy walk all through that castle from bow to stern carrying two bowls of oil with fire burning as a test of his concentration &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t drop a single drop and burn my carpet up&rdquo; and that boy really walks and he says, &ldquo;I want you to go into my entire castle, examine every piece of furniture and everything and come back and tell me what you see.&rdquo; Well in 10 hours the boy came back and the king said to him, &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Your majesty I was too busy, too cautious, trying not to drop a single bit of oil and burn your beautiful building down, I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to look.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Well you failed the test, go back to your parents.&rdquo; Well this is the biggest disgrace a person can have to know when he goes to his parents and says, &ldquo;My Guru don&rsquo;t accept me for initiation, I&rsquo;m unworthy,&rdquo; and this is the height of you know losing face in the spiritual realm, but he says, &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;ll give you another chance only because of your father&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; So we see certain things come in to play in consciousness, so he gave him another chance but this time he never came back, he had to go looking for the boy, and he found the boy in the garden and you know he found him with the two bowls of the oil and he was like this, burning right down like a lamp you know like that and he said to him, &ldquo;Have you seen the interior of my castle and all its beauty,&rdquo; and the boy said to him, &ldquo;The eye that pierced the light and behold the jewel thereby knows how life exists. Thou alone O Guru is life.&rdquo; The man touched him he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in Cosmic Consciousness, enjoy it.&rdquo; He found the castle, the real castle that was his whole body, he found everything, he found the jewels there-in, the seven centers, and he saw the levels in which he had to go and this was what he was working for and he realized it was the inner light that this teacher was trying to point out. Now the human person is important. Now we&rsquo;ve all been initiated to a certain extent but that doesn&rsquo;t say if a great Master was to walk in and there are many living today, if one was to come in the room and was giving initiation, is there anyone in here would refuse to take it? Audience: (Laughting) If we find ourselves getting a chance at it. Adano: If in the present you&rsquo;re still&hellip; this doesn&rsquo;t detract from the SRF disciples or the SRF Masters or any other Masters that exist, any Master that comes must realize who is sending the Masters in the first place, you think they come of their own will? They didn&rsquo;t desire to come, they discovered they were Soul and they discovered the responsibility that goes with being a Soul, Soul realized individual, they realize that they are shepherds gathering stray sheep for the owner of the the ranch, they are working for the owner. 1:20 In other words Soul realizes that the uninformed being cannot remain in that uninformed state because it will lead to disintegration of the universal principles you see and therefore they yoke themselves to this law, that&rsquo;s the word where the yoga comes in. They put themselves in yoke to drag this responsibility, to assume this particular condition to pull up their fellow Man. Audience: And bring the regenerative factors. Adano: Yeah. Now even Master would say, He calls Himself the eternal boatman, He uses this as a simile, &ldquo;I would ply my boat across the Stygian Sea of life a million times a million times to bring one erring brother back to the Soul light, in other words you can imagine this consciousness is always going to reach out. Now every Master that is everyone who has realized that he is Soul realizes the universal responsibility. Now in the story of Cain and Abel when Cain killed Abel and he was called to account for it he said, &ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; But you see Cain does not know, in other words ego doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s Soul, it&rsquo;s only the Soul knows its Soul and the ego destroys any attempt that the Soul&hellip; Audience: Or was blinded to it at the time. Adano: Right, see Cain was blinded by his own ego, now the same thing is that a Man doesn&rsquo;t want to accept he is Soul because he realizes it&rsquo;s too big a job, it&rsquo;s a big job this is not an easy thing, you can realize. This is not an easy thing to say to someone, &ldquo;I accept you Guru, I place my full life, I surrender and take the responsibility of Your discipline.&rdquo; And now the Guru can be have an iron fisted type of discipline or He can have a loving discipline or any type of discipline but it&rsquo;s very hard because what the Guru puts upon us can wreck many of us but it doesn&rsquo;t kill us. Audience: Well look&hellip; Adano: It&rsquo;s like in Marley&rsquo;s case you see, in Marley&rsquo;s case the knife flipped out of the garbage disposal and went right into her eye. Now what can be more damaging to lose one sight? Now it could have killed her but it didn&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;ll give you an illustration in my own life, slipped off 30 feet from the building, hit the ground, it was up to me to die or live. So Master didn&rsquo;t give me all&hellip; I prayed for my karma yes but here it is. I am in the ground and I have 54 compound fractures and still He did not cut the life stream and say, &ldquo;Okay go on,&rdquo; because in the consciousness I was ready to accept death because I fell down, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t get up in my own case and I would say well gee whiz, I&rsquo;m seeing life all going on I says, &ldquo;boy this really is, what can be more beautiful than this whole great creation? What do they need this body for? Let me just live in this realm forever.&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t. Point is this, you have to come back now, in other words the time ain&rsquo;t come, you got to live in this, learn more lessons of this human form, learn lessons that are important to this human form, the only way you&rsquo;re going to learn it is by passing through these tests, so I had to go through pain and suffering and almost death too. Well the heart stopped twice on the operating table, so even that the Guru never stopped His love. Audience: I was just wondering (inaudible). Adano: Yeah that made be crazy for sure, it sure will be crazy. Well now you see when I meditate if I build up the image of Master&rsquo;s form I&rsquo;m holding back the Master too because I am relying on that form to bring home communication to my being. I realize I have to break that too and one night I&rsquo;m meditating and I saw the form and then the form disappeared, there was no form, just light light light, peace peace. So I realized now the formless God is the reality of myself, I have to learn to accept to live with this thing, with true love for the first time. Now this is quite a pain, it&rsquo;s a painful thing to all of a sudden lose an association with a form you know of someone that you&rsquo;re familiar with and then to slowly dissolve into light&hellip; Audience: Isn&rsquo;t it a sort of a dependence that you had to lose on this other? Adano: In a sense you can call it that but really no it&rsquo;s not a dependence on the form that you really lose, it&rsquo;s a re-evaluation of what the form is doing in that dimension of existence for you. You have to evaluate yourself and look at it and says, &ldquo;Really without this form, God could never communicate to my form.&rdquo; Without having used form as a medium of communication, it would never be possible for me to accept the reality of myself, it would never be possible to accept inner light, it would never be possible to want to grow in light. It&rsquo;s because He has used form and because we have been constantly reminded of form, that&rsquo;s why we bring him back, what Paul is saying, &ldquo;We need a living Guru or a friend here.&rdquo; It is because this is the way of righteousness, that&rsquo;s why&hellip; you see Jesus when He was baptized or initiated by John his Guru, as I said one time He came to this Jordan river and He saw this Guru standing there and He said to him, &ldquo;You baptize me.&rdquo; That means you initiate me, you open this inner light and John says, &ldquo;No you do it because you&rsquo;re more evolved now.&rdquo; But He says &ldquo;No you do it because this is the way of righteousness.&rdquo; Now picture for one moment two grown adults debating at a critical moment of water there, who to bathe who, you can see it doesn&rsquo;t really mean that, it goes into a depth. It takes the student to recognize that Master and He recognized that this was His Master, He recognized it, it had to come from an inner awareness. Now we may meet various teachers who will initiate us but then one teacher will come along and automatically you gaze upon him you&rsquo;ve known you&rsquo;ve had an association from way back in time and you&rsquo;ll link up but it&rsquo;s there but these are all different associations with the Guru, the Guru is always there. Now the Masters say you have one Guru for life, well that one Guru for life is God working through various human forms to bring you back to Him. Now at one incarnation you might have been sitting down at the feet of Arjuna who was a fully illumined prince after he was illuminated by Krishna and listening to a discourse and in another incarnation you might be sitting down at the feet of William the Conqueror listening to a discourse or another incarnation you might be sitting down at the feet of Saint Francis and listening to a discourse and another incarnation you might be sitting down at the feet of Yogananda listening to a discourse but is it Yogananda, is it Saint Francis, is it William the Conqueror, is it Arjuna who is the Guru? Are these not the forms, the suit that the Guru wears, that God wears all the time to bring the Soul back? God is the Eternal Life using many suits, many incidences, many roles of life to bring back what? Not to bring back Adano&rsquo;s physical body, because what is Adano&rsquo;s physical body? This is tissue, it&rsquo;s a classification, it&rsquo;s a name given to a form, well what is talking? It&rsquo;s life talking, life is communicating, life. Now it&rsquo;s very hard to say is life male or female? We can only see when it breaks up in the cells and it starts to appear off but actually the life in the male cell or the life in the female cell, is it not life? They&rsquo;re all life, it&rsquo;s all God flowing back. So this is what is happening the Guru is making us or God is making us conscious that we are Soul in the form of the Guru, all the time, that we are Soul. He wants us to realize this all the time, He wants us because He made us in that image, He made us in that likeness that capacity, and He endowed us with this principle of life to know that we are Soul, there&rsquo;s no other way else we can go to it. So Jesus says, &ldquo;This is the way of righteousness,&rdquo; this is the way you got to go back, you have to return via the form principle, via the Guru principle. 1:30 Now many of us can go about shouting we don&rsquo;t have need of a Guru in order to discover God but you know many Masters says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be in the presence of a Man who found God without a Guru because he&rsquo;s a highly inflated egotist.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;If he had found God without a Guru, certainly God would not have had need of Masters.&rdquo; See we need Masters. Audience: Well my only problem is that I need one and don&rsquo;t find it so I guess I&rsquo;m just not ready. Adano: No, wait a minute, the Masters are coming through all the time, they will come through, the Masters are coming through, I don&rsquo;t say a Master. The Masters are the various Sons of Light, God Light, are coming through in human form in full awareness and enlightenment because right in this human form and on this continent there are many Souls waiting for the illumination of themselves. You will be exposed to the Divine Truth handed down more and more, you&rsquo;ll be ground into it gradually until you are fully filled to the point that when the physical illumined being walked through the room and initiate you, you may accept the initiation and not know Him to be your Master, you may accept the initiation and know Him to be your Master, but only when you have the inner experiences, when He takes you across the threshold of light inside of yourself do you know that this particular one is the Guru for that particular period of that consciousness going back. Now you may recognize, put it this way, Master once said this, no one would come to Him who was not a disciple of Him in a past life, but would not recognize it. Now let&rsquo;s say had I sat down on the feet of Saint Francis in a past life but cannot recognize it in Yogananda, I haven&rsquo;t recognized Saint Francis, yet Yogananda can reveal Saint Francis through His mechanism to me if He wanted and I look at Yogananda and I wouldn&rsquo;t see Yogananda, I would have seen Saint Francis. Audience: Oh really? Adano: Right. Only because I might have had the association with Saint Francis from a past life. Now a Guru will sit down in this room and if you have an association with a great Saint in a past life and you don&rsquo;t want to accept His present form as the Guru, He will work the consciousness that you will see through His body who that Guru was in a past life where you did sit at the feet and took lessons but then you will wake up to the reality, &ldquo;hey buddy,&rdquo; for a moment what happened He only incarnated now in this new body form to teach me the same thing I fouled up with in the past one. If I goofed as a catholic monk in some past incarnation at some other monks feet because I didn&rsquo;t grasp the inner truth and seeing it now presented now in yoga form and don&rsquo;t grasp it yet, I&rsquo;m still gonna need another human form, somebody to grasp it as uh calculus and integral uh mechanical movements so eventually I&rsquo;ve got to grasp it, you understand it? So the point is this, whenever you grasp the truth it&rsquo;ll come into you, the Guru does that. Audience: The only thing I would say is I think I&rsquo;m certainly aware all Gurus are manifestations of the same Light, but I think that in any given period of time. Adano: Yes that is true, you see the Sat Guru in a given period is to reinforce this portion of creation, dumb flesh, that cannot avoid craving an association. I once said before early in the evening, a lion would love to have a larger lion as his God, you can&rsquo;t see Man as God, you only want to eat him or obey him, but if he saw a bigger lion than himself he sure would bow down and worship him. Now a Man would not bow down to a lion but he would bow down to a superman which you call a God Man, you see what I mean? So we need the affinity to worship, that&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;This is the way of righteousness.&rdquo; This is a principle, we want something that we have to reach up to in our form, our makeup. Audience: It sort of seems silly when I acknowledge to myself once in a while that I want something I can reach up to, but that&rsquo;s exactly what it is. Adano: Yeah. Now there are those who have already passed through that road who come in as Rishis, well even when you come in as a Rishi like take the Maharishi of Arunachala. Here He was an illumined Soul from a past life, now at the age of 13 He read a few scriptures and all of a sudden He decided to make the acid test if He&rsquo;s Soul or He has a Soul. So He pretended to die and He tried to simulate the effects of death. So he got in a cave and He tried suspended animation or trans as you want to call it or cataleptic condition and He tried and He tried and at the end of the third day He was called Rishi. He woke up with the awareness that He was always known this before. So the question comes up now where did this Man get His&hellip; where is His Guru, where is the Maharishi Guru, you see? Where is the Guru for this man but He had a Guru. If the individual who didn&rsquo;t write that information down and leave it for Him to go and read it and if He didn&rsquo;t had some affinity to the author and try to experiment, how would He gonna practice this thing? Alright, He read that this Man, this particular Saint, wrote this thing down in this book, so let&rsquo;s say this Saint&rsquo;s name is Ram Singh, so He went in the room and He started, &ldquo;Oh Ram Singh I&rsquo;m going to try to die,&rdquo; but He still had to call in that particular author, He&rsquo;s going to duplicate the other&rsquo;s instructions and when He did accomplish the feat, He saw the Guru standing there with Himself but also that author was just a fulfillment of the same thing too because then He realized. It&rsquo;s like in the case of uh Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna did something for everybody which we fail to realize, Ramakrishna studied every religion and attained illumination in all of them. He studied Christianity and attained illumination in it, He studied Buddhism and attained illumination, He studied the Koran and attained illumination, He studied Hinduism and attained the illumination, He studied the Sufis and attained illumination, and He ended up saying, &ldquo;The way to God is the Guru.&rdquo; That all His disciples, His most advanced disciple Vivikananda said to me, &ldquo;You are my God, you are the Guru.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t see nothing else, He saw God and all of these things, in all the scriptures He saw the same, He saw the Gurus in all of them, He saw Guru in all of them, He didn&rsquo;t see one was more important than the other. If you can find illumination in reading one scripture and see the same common bond in all these scriptures, you have found Guru. God is the Guru but there&rsquo;s always going to be some human contact that brings you to the path, this is what you want. Audience: You still need a Sat Guru I think to take you from where you are when you realize there&rsquo;s a Guru. Adano: I did not say you don&rsquo;t need&hellip; You see you&rsquo;re confusing something with an issue of a Sat Guru, the word Sat means existence already, the eternal existing consciousness, the only thing that exists in this universe is not Man, the thing that exists in this universal is Conscious Life which we know as God, we know as God, which we realize has become us in the form of Man and which we need in the form of Man to re-establish our identity with it, could you follow me that clearly? Do you see the process that is involved in a thing like that? Now a Sat Guru is only a specific statement of such a realignment that because we are not equipped in our limited thinking of not having a Soul, we need this physical illustration. If we never had physical illustrations of what Soul qualities are, we cannot follow it, if by merely reading alone of Soul qualities you&rsquo;re not going to practice it, but because there are instances in life when Soul qualities are demonstrated by matter to illustrate to matter its true nature, we follow a living Guru because here is an example. &ldquo;Lives of great men all remind us we should make our lives sublime, they&rsquo;re going ahead of us leaving footprints on the sands of time&rdquo; but without an example, a Guru is an example of Soul in motion. 1:40 Now if you were born in 1863 and Kirpal Singh is born in this period where where would the two meet? If you died before you came into this body, you follow me, or Charan Singh is born in this particular period and you were born way back in seventeen something, where would the two meet? Audience: If there&rsquo;s always a manifestation of the Guru and a line of succession then you have no problem. Adano: The Gurus will always tell you, you have a way to go back to God and a line of succession is a simple statement, we must not confuse this statement of line of succession with a personality. The link between one Master to another is the one principle of truth that is being transferred on. I cannot come and tell you if I am a teacher of the Baptist&rsquo;s faith to follow Catholicism when all my teachers behind me were teaching me the Baptist faith. Now I am a missionary for the Baptist faith, if I&rsquo;m a missionary for the Catholic faith I&rsquo;ll teach you Catholicism, if I&rsquo;m a missionary for the Sufi faith I&rsquo;ll teach you Sufism, if I&rsquo;m a teacher of any faith that&rsquo;s the faith I&rsquo;m teaching. Now what these Masters are not teaching no faith of no particular group, they are teaching us the reality of ourselves because they have experienced the reality of themselves, you see this is a vast difference, they are not teaching us doctrines. So a Man who wants to know the truth about himself must seek out men who have the knowledge concerning the self and that link back with men who have achieved this realization. Certainly I wouldn&rsquo;t go to a Baptist minister to find out how this mechanism work, that doesn&rsquo;t say he may not be acquainted with in his writings, but if he is unaware of how it functions within himself, you mean I&rsquo;m going to trust my automobile with a refrigerator mechanic? You follow what I mean? You&rsquo;re not going to do anything like that, so to say to someone he needs a Sat Guru and a line of Sat Gurus you&rsquo;re not really communicating what is necessary for the person to equip himself for. What the person has to equip himself for is to realize that Masters of life principles teach only that, how to realize yourself, They don&rsquo;t teach anything else, therefore there is no conflict in none of the Masters of life though They be the very sparks or the very cause of which all religions seem to spring from and maintain itself. These great Masters seem to be the fountainhead for it but They when They get together what do They talk about, They talk of light, They talk of sun, They talk of Divine Consciousness and peace. Now there are certain levels which our five senses and our memory patterns and certain desire patterns have caused certain restrictions on this Life Principle, It has placed certain restrictions to prevent us from recognizing we are Soul, therefore we are hung up, we are stuck with these peculiar patterns, we can&rsquo;t seem to get out of it and by not being informed how to get out of it and having no one to turn to to get out of it, books are not enough. A mere getting together in a group is not enough, you need some human form to consult with, you need somebody in a physical way to tell you how to get out of it. So I&rsquo;m not saying that the Sat Guru in any period of time or in any human body form is unimportant, I&rsquo;m saying the time comes that you will lock on to One in any time, in any time sequence when you have those problems to solve, you see. Audience: Well I perfectly agree with you. All I&rsquo;m saying at the same time though is that all Vina players will agree the beauty of the Vina, but there is very likely in a given time a Vina player and that&rsquo;s important. That&rsquo;s part of the search too, certainly you want to search&hellip; Adano: I agree with what you&rsquo;re saying, I agree with what you&rsquo;re saying, part of the search is to find a Guru, is it part of the search to latch on as a leach to the Guru? Then what is the real search? Audience: The search is to understand oneself. Adano: Then if the real search is to understand oneself, then the Guru is an example of what oneself is supposed to aspire to. That&rsquo;s why I say the only relationship that does exist is a Guru/Disciple relationship but this is an impersonal statement, it&rsquo;s not placed upon a personal basis that I must have this physical personal person sitting down here to talk to me all the time, I accept the physical form as a measurement through which I can reach my inner self but I must also see it as an example through which I can measure. In other words if I have a reference, if I have a diagram, I can build this kit, I can build this object. Now the characteristics of a Guru is not to demonstrate miracles, if that was so I don&rsquo;t need a Guru at no time, what I need from the Guru primarily is how to behave in a world comprising human beings and verbal communication where a word from one person with a wrong tone of voice can hurt you for years, the same word with a certain tone of voice can make your best friend for years. I want to know how to survive and live in this universe where this is happening that love permeates the communication, where human association is communicating, because this leads me to freedom, it leads me to an understanding of self. Now this would be exactly what the Beatitudes entail, they entail attitudes of behavior. Now Jesus said, &ldquo;None come unto the Father but by Me&rdquo; but He&rsquo;s not implying that you imprison yourself to His physical form, He&rsquo;s implying that you get to the depth of the thing, to get to the inner meaning of the thing, the inner workings of the thing. Now we do meet a living Guru and a living Guru gives us Diksha or initiation and He gives us Darshan what is called a booster charge, why? Because we are not Souls yet, we haven&rsquo;t realized that condition, we are still laboring with the fact that we have a Soul. Now unless we see the human form at some time, we will not be able to eradicate from our consciousness that we HAVE a Soul, you see? Even though you listen to me tonight and here, you cannot walk out of this room honestly and say to yourself&hellip; Audience: I am Soul. Adano: I am Soul. Can you honestly eradicate and walk out and feel this fully but if you see a living Master sitting in the room emanating this inner awareness to you and you can lock on to it and you can walk in that realm with Him and I don&rsquo;t mean walk from here to the bathroom or out in the yard, I mean really walk in consciousness with Him, then you know Soul, you see, and that is only the reason why the Guru is there, He is there to make you conscious. Now as long as this is necessary by the Creative Intelligence, this is a necessary thing, it&rsquo;s established that Man must have a contact, he cannot go out of this physical frame without having one physical contact with a human being that is in that particular level of consciousness, this is what I admit is necessary. Now that doesn&rsquo;t say I must go looking for the Man, if God is working through us He is bringing that Man into your life. Audience: People here you can give names books of Teachers but if the Teacher wants them the book will turn up in the back seat of the car. Adano: Alright the point is this&hellip; Audience: The Teacher will suddenly walk through the room. Adano: Right, the thing is the Teacher walks in the room, here&rsquo;s an illustration, an illustration of a consciousness, let&rsquo;s see your reaction. (Adano gives a very short meditation). 1:50 Many things have happened, let&rsquo;s see what is your reaction and see if you can point out what you have recognized, what have you felt. You see truth is demonstrable, it&rsquo;s not something you just merely talk, it&rsquo;s until you have to live. What can you recognize in that gesture? Audience: What I said, you and say Mrs Manchester or anyone here, Mrs Hardaway, Baurise&rsquo;s, Lucille are all people who are aspiring and have arrived at an understanding but the important thing I still have to go back to is that I know that from all the lessons I can learn here and from what I have still to accomplish, there still has to be this inner journey and this still has to be&hellip; Adano: The inner journey, you see the thing is what you&rsquo;re not recognizing&hellip; Audience: Inside the outside (inaudible). Adano: When we step out, apart from the pull of this mechanism and feel the free flow of consciousness, you&rsquo;re always in the presence of Guru. Now your Guru is always in a state of illumination, if you have never met Him, He&rsquo;s still standing next to you because you don&rsquo;t make an attempt to step out of the pull of your body or the demands of your body, He&rsquo;ll wait till the time come when He&rsquo;ll have to break you from that confinement and then you can walk out of being in it. Now this is the carrier who we&rsquo;re trying to point out. Now some people this has happened to already, a long time, it has happened to many people on that particular condition and when they&rsquo;ve walked out, they have seen various Masters waiting to greet them. Yet when a physical Master does walk through the physical plane, they will go with respect to that person and get His physical contact for one good reason. The one good reason is this is flesh and it ain&rsquo;t going to accept beyond all reasonable doubt that everything that is happening on the inner plane is real no matter how fantastic or how miraculous it will perform for it, it still wants to know he&rsquo;s meeting a human being. That&rsquo;s the peculiarity, this flesh is afraid, it&rsquo;s afraid and God made it in such a peculiar way to want to accept human beings to what we call huddling together like monkeys. Audience: I&rsquo;m so glad you said that. Adano: We see meeting a living Master is one who&rsquo;s enlightened already, He&rsquo;s gone the whole gamut, He&rsquo;s already pure consciousness, He&rsquo;s in God realization, He can come to you in many levels. He can come to you while He&rsquo;s in his physical body living way off in India and make you conscious that He is the Guru and He may never come to you after that in the physical body. He may come to you while living in India in a physical body, come to you in the inner plane, make you conscious of His existence. He&rsquo;s in the human body, He&rsquo;s not dead yet, He&rsquo;s in the human body and yet may never come to you in the physical body and you ask yourself, &ldquo;why is that&rdquo; and He may not come to you that way, He may come to you in a travel through the physical body and wait for you to slowly recognize Him and work through and keep fondling you on till you break that association, that when He is away now from you in vision or physical sight, you have to learn to rely to see him inside. Now what is that Guru really doing? Don&rsquo;t you see He&rsquo;s performing something for a reason, He&rsquo;s freeing you from certain conditions that you&rsquo;ve long mastered or certain conditions you need to master about yourself. Yogananda, I did not go up to see his physical body, I never wanted to see the Master&rsquo;s physical body in this incarnation, in other words I had a deep set conscious feeling way back in consciousness or time that the human body I&rsquo;ve seen enough Masters in the human body, I sat at Their feet a long time, I wanted to travel in the consciousness inside myself, so when I came across the first experience from Him was in the inner plane and from that day on I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming to see you in California&rdquo; and I never went and one of His disciples, this was funny, they did not know, his name is Kriyananda, on three occasions he made an issue of this thing, he said to the Master, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we bring Mr. Ley here and let him stay here and be a minister and be trained in the ashrams&rdquo; and the first time he asked the Master you know the Master said to him? He told me himself from his own mouth and other people told me about it, he said Yogananda replied and says, &ldquo;What is he going to do here, look at the palm trees? He&rsquo;s doing the work he&rsquo;s supposed to do where he is.&rdquo; In other words I was solving the problems that the Guru/Disciple relationship involved, I was solving the necessary disciplines where I was, in other words I&rsquo;ve already accepted the Guru is God, I&rsquo;ve accepted this whole universe as a school and I accepted the fact that in this life form Yogananda&rsquo;s body as it was God the new teacher form. What do I have to see Him in this form? Can a teacher not teach by public address system without the students seeing him and still get the same information and knowing he is still is existing in the top floor? It&rsquo;s a matter of how you set up your consciousness that the Guru can work for you, you follow what I&rsquo;m saying? Audience: I think you still might go to the physical form of the Master for the Darshan. Adano: Alright, let me show you something else. You talk about the physical form for the Darshan, I meditated where I was, the first time Kriyananda asked this Master that. The second time he asked Him the same question, He was giving a Kriya initiation to many of my friends that I have sent to SRF and He was performing this Kriya initiation that year in California which was the largest performed that year and normally a person don&rsquo;t get the initiation until two years of lessons, I had only started this course a matter of six months. I did not want to see His physical body because I knew right away if a Guru&hellip; you don&rsquo;t have to go pestering a human body, why are you going to pester it because you&rsquo;re only going to see consciousness, you&rsquo;re going to see the illumination there, it is up to you now to make the effort to get in that consciousness. I decided to stay home and I was living in Canada at the time and meditate, this was my duty. My duty to my God was to sit down and meditate and this is what I had to do, I had to do it, nobody&rsquo;s going to do it for you. I got a letter, this initiation was going on on a Saturday, I got a letter from California on the Friday and in the letter was a set of lessons on the Kriya initiation and the letter stating, &ldquo;Prepare yourself to be initiated tomorrow at seven o&rsquo;clock your time.&rdquo; Now every one of my friends have paid hundreds of dollars to go to California just to see the Master to be initiated in the physical form, as long as He was in there, they were going to get initiated in the physical form and here I am instrumental in helping them to all go there and I am not going, you know what I&rsquo;m saying. So I should be the one who should be very happy after having these experiences of wanting to go see the Man in the human body right? More so than trying to make people want to go there. I sat in my house and I sat down to meditate and just about seven o&rsquo;clock like some great force had drawn all the air out of the room, there&rsquo;s not a single noise, and my I can hear like if we&rsquo;re hearing all the atoms in nature just vibrating and I felt a thumb and I say He had a big hand, He really has a big hand because that thumb was big, knocked my forehead right here for about two seconds and I tell you I was gone totally. 2:00 I didn&rsquo;t go nowhere out of my body but my consciousness was all in space back and forth just flying back again. I knew peace peace peace peace peace peace there was nothing but peace and levels of peace and levels of peace just kept going on and I realized that I didn&rsquo;t have to go looking for the physical Guru, I&rsquo;d long be freed from that imprisonment of physical form, that the Guru now was the eternal life and I heard deep down in my consciousness this consciousness (inaudible) vibrating, &ldquo;It is done&rdquo; but I never saw the Master. I meditated for years after that, I never saw Him in any other astral form, He never came to me in an astral form, He only came once, the day He died or He left the body. I was going home, I arrived there was a telegram and I opened the telegram and I read He just passed away. Well there I&rsquo;m going to show you human recriminations, I started to swear and I kick up the floor, I says, &ldquo;What a damn fool I was, I should have gone there to see the Man while He was in the human body.&rdquo; You need to see the Sat Guru in the human body, you must have human contact and here I&rsquo;m going through exactly the rigamarole talk of the same thing, &ldquo;I should have gone, I lost&hellip; what have I gained? I&rsquo;ve only got a few uh inner experiences and building my consciousness.&rdquo; Here the thing that was more important now is to see that human body, see how human form wants human form? A lion needs a bigger lion to look up to, &ldquo;I need to go and see,&rdquo; deep down there was something missing &ldquo;I should have gone and see.&rdquo; No sooner I had said that, I felt my eyes closed down and I heard like a huge voice said, &ldquo;Who is dead? I&rsquo;m alive, you know it all,&rdquo; like that I knew He was lifting off karma from my mechanism like mad and I can see all these things moving (inaudible). From that day on I knew the whole course of the SRF without even looking at it and didn&rsquo;t even read the balance. The thing had worked, what I wanted most to know about, I wanted His blessings from that realm without having to go and say, &ldquo;I was touching human form and satisfying human form.&rdquo; I wanted to know that really Divinity was working from any level, from any time and space, could reach out to Man and touch him. In other words I was trying to really appreciate His existence in California which I call the podium of the church and Canada where I was living, pew 93 at the back of the church, and all the masses were up standing taller above me and I&rsquo;m sitting back here trying to peek through the crowd to see where the Guru is, but at last I can feel what that Light was coming down was enough for me because this was how I was I had already accepted the Guru consciousness. I was no longer looking for physical form no more. Audience: You see that would be one thing that you needed to have you see. The same thing as there was an initiation in Dallas last spring and I was out at White Rock lake at the same time. I know what you&rsquo;re talking about the form is doing what it is doing, be somewhere else and still feel it. I mean just the same as you can know your Master here but the Master might be in India. Adano: But that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve, you&rsquo;re trying to achieve Soul awareness, you&rsquo;re not trying to achieve body awareness, if you want to achieve body awareness&hellip; Audience: But what I&rsquo;m saying, some people go to see the body presence and then they never achieve the Soul presence, certainly you want to achieve the Soul presence, but having achieved the Soul presence and the Soul awareness that over the space you might still, for the sake of your body and for the sake of your Darshan, go and see the Master. Adano: Yes I&rsquo;m not saying&hellip; no I&rsquo;m not saying&hellip; no I don&rsquo;t say that that&rsquo;s what&hellip; the human form wants that, I&rsquo;ll tell you why it needs it. There&rsquo;s a very good reason for needing it, we are nurtured out from the principle of sensation of touch because this whole human body is touch, this whole human body is touch, and it&rsquo;s the only true sensation that you&rsquo;ve got left apart from sight and hearing and tasting and smelling because you touch the universe with your eyes. When I look at you I touch you through my eyes in some form because I can reach out and touch it, I can touch you through my hearing, I can touch you through my nose, but they are imperfect in the actual touch when I can reach out and say, &ldquo;Good evening, how are you?&rdquo; There is a transfer so because of that there is a tremendous cellular need for sensation and touch and love can only be transferred in a profound way between two beings except by touch and the profoundness of a Master&rsquo;s love for His disciple is most enjoyable when you go out and get a physical touch from Him, there is no greater physical association after that because this is something you have lived through in a biological way with Him. Now that sensation, that electrical charge that is transferred and it&rsquo;s tingling through your body, this if it remains years after He gone on to other forms of existence and you can reach out and feel it, this is what will keep your faith growing and what will keep the devotion going, but if you&rsquo;ve never felt&hellip; As I said I felt this huge big thumb and it didn&rsquo;t matter if I went to Los Angeles and He put that big thumb, what would I feel more than that one that He&rsquo;s really putting there in time and space? In other words He was reaching out through time and space in that dimension of consciousness and touching me there. All the letters said, &ldquo;Prepare yourself for the initiation&rdquo; and I sat down in front of the table, that little altar I had, and I just waited and it was just like a human hand, and there were times when I myself and Sonny would be meditating and I could feel that big hand, He puts it around your neck, you know you can feel it when a Master puts that hand and you feel that that power is there. Now you know you don&rsquo;t have to want to see the (inaudible), once you know it&rsquo;s a reassuring effect that He can reach out, this consciousness can reach out through time and space, through dense matter, and affect you, this is what you&rsquo;re trying. This is a greater realization you&rsquo;re going for because then you&rsquo;re not walking with the fact that uh you&rsquo;re hanging on to Guru&rsquo;s shirt tails you see. Now the Masters have always said there are two ways to live with the Guru, you see there are two ways to live with the Guru relationship, one is like a cat and a kitten, the other is like a monkey and its baby. Now a cat and a kitten, the cat picks the kitten by the neck and drags it and put it in one place and leave it and comes back and moves it from one place to the other, that is what you call the total surrender to the Divine Will of the Guru, never questioning Him for no moment&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="1965---volume-6-divinity">1965 - Volume 6 Divinity</h2>
<p>Adano65_Vol6_DivinityQ1RRNW6 - &hellip; didn&rsquo;t magnetize them to us. Now if you magnetize everything to yourself, you&rsquo;re greedy, you&rsquo;re only going to get those things you need and abundantly. You don&rsquo;t want what you don&rsquo;t need right? You can&rsquo;t use it so the idea is that in consciousness there is an inexhaustible source of supply as well as an inexhaustible source of fulfillment in relation to the eternal life of the self. This eternal principle is what makes for Divinity. Now we realize a Guru / disciple relationship is a drama, it&rsquo;s an exemplary approach whereby we work in this process and eventually to be free from the form of Guru knowing that God is the true Guru, the I AM-self is the real Guru, making us lord of ourselves, a truth that frees us all and likeness to the condition, a light enlightening us to the point where we know we are lord of self. Lord of self that is capable of the responsibility to think, apply this thinking, apply this knowing of this thinking, and reacting and feeling proportionately to this thinking and feeling. This is lord of self because lord of self don&rsquo;t mean I take advantage of you or I satisfy myself before you or whatever means I step out apart from my fellow Man, lord of self is the truth through which my self is composed of, it&rsquo;s the reality of my of my mechanism and to that I&rsquo;m aware of and I can direct that. In other words there is no sense of inadequacy in self, it is always inexhaustible and in its own inimitable way of timing it will always fulfill. All the great Masters have said, those who&rsquo;ve all realized it, that there is no thought that can go unfulfilled, no matter how many life forms are necessary for it. So if eternal life and the principle of self is a law unto itself, then it is not impossible for a human being not to experience the manifestation of thought in action, it is always possible for a human form to see the manifestation of thought in action and talk is thinking, thought are things, prayer is only a method of evaluating or trying to trigger the thinking process into an action and it is the desire pattern plus the motivation and the knowledge of the feeling/reacting principle that allows us to see this God Himself, otherwise we don&rsquo;t see anything, we have nothing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come that ye may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; Abundantly is the fulfillment of this principle, you see how it works? (gap in tape). Actually I&rsquo;m just what you call a clean up man of the Saints. Every Saint is like a Master physician you know, they perform on the operation on the patient by giving him the initiation or the lesson or knowledge and then they go on their way, but a patient needs someone to comfort him, rub his nose, stuck in the sheet, and coax him along to recuperate. So that&rsquo;s where I come in, I am emphasize the daily practice of meditation. Tonight I want to show, through the daily practice of meditation, the four steps to Divinity. First step, the art of conscious sleep. The second step, the art of consciousness death. The third step, the art of conscious projection or resurrection and fourth, the art of conscious ascension. Each one of these steps find its bedrock in meditation. Now meditation is a word that has haunted many people for centuries, you&rsquo;ll find it in every type of book, lots of things have been written about it, but the European Sages were very wise, they would never just leave a wisdom so vast, so complex, yet so simple in one word, they knew the art of word puzzles you see and they knew how to camouflage and hide the science from the uninitiate and they usually would keep people away from the actual science of meditation because they could not use people who did not suffer enough and have enough conscious control of the mechanism to work this particular science. Now one of the ladies here have mentioned, &ldquo;Why do women go more often to these studies than men?&rdquo; A woman suffers more than a man, first she has to bear children, she knows the different aches and pains during the monthly periods. It is during these aches and pains that keep her ever conscious of her mechanism and the Sages knew this was true but a man was conscious more of his senses, not of the aches and pains, but the drives through the senses. Therefore they would emphasize that the man abstain in order to curb the senses and in the woman they would emphasize devotion to lift her above her senses. You see they understood the mechanics properly but they would never divulge it unless one got deep into them and most Saints or Sages had three types of students, one they call the outer ring, one they call the second ring, and the last they call the inner ring. There is a reason for that? The outer ring came and was looking at the Saint as a sort of a cafeteria, every Saint he met he pick a little and he went his way so the Saint never bothered. The second ring, (inaudible) decide that he wants to eat steak or chips or whatever it is, he picked to stay with one movement for a while till he got frustrated and the last ring was the one that volunteered, no matter what the Saint did to him, he volunteered and the Saint knew He had good material to work with you see. Now you find that most Saints drew to Them more women than men, They had to, so all throughout lives the women were the central core. Yet the speakers of these Saints were men because they came from the second ring, you understand, and therefore they were not touching the Guru or the Saint as much as the women but because the Saint&rsquo;s work must survive, these speakers or men, which you find more in the second ring, they took upon it by initiative and tried to propagate the teachings. That&rsquo;s why you find today, you&rsquo;ll all find more women seeking it because of the devotion versus the initial drive to teach. I said before meditation is the bedrock but most of us hear this word and it&rsquo;s like something nebulous in the sky, it really doesn&rsquo;t mean something tangible, something workable, something applicable. First you will hear it means to commune with God, the Saint says &ldquo;yes it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; He wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s wrong and then you&rsquo;ll hear He says it&rsquo;s taking something and analyzing it, picking it apart and trying to find its geography of it, its structure, it&rsquo;s components, yes that&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s not wrong, that&rsquo;s meditation. So one is searching, &ldquo;what is the Saint trying to say? 0:10 Then he says, &ldquo;Well show us how to meditate Master.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right here (Adano gives short meditation), are you satisfied My children?&rdquo; So right away the outer ring, the second ring, will start writing, &ldquo;this is meditation.&rdquo; Then everything that He keep telling them, that&rsquo;s meditation, the Saint is looking, He knows He&rsquo;s coaxing them to another degree. We find out after a while that the word is an anagram, if we understand what an anagram is today, we will understand what we&rsquo;re talking about. An anagram is a word puzzle made up of many words&rsquo; initial letter, you put it together and you make a word. For centuries the word meditation has been stuck with us, they were smart, you know they say chinese crossword puzzles or Indian crossword puzzles, they&rsquo;re pretty smart, putting this thing and hiding it, because the inner sanctum, those who had the power to work with it knew what they were doing and they were bound by certain oaths not to reveal them, but they kept the other outer two rings in the dark temporarily knowing that time, the evolution of Man, eventually will bring him there for the true meaning of meditation. Orientals never wrote this way you see, they wrote this way, top to bottom and most writings you&rsquo;ll see are written this way and sometimes you see it written this way, but you don&rsquo;t understand why they converge in some of the scrolls, one going this way, and one going this way and when you look at it this way it says &ldquo;meditation.&rdquo; So to translate that word going this way into English you don&rsquo;t read this way in English so normally the translator will put it this way and read this way. &ldquo;M&rdquo; reading this way now in its true context, has to stand only for Mental, it doesn&rsquo;t stand for anything else because it&rsquo;s a mental sign and it&rsquo;s mind process. &ldquo;E&rdquo; stands only for energy. Now scientists in this modern world have validated that only two things actually exist, the Sages knew that a long time, consciousness or mind energy or force, so he said &ldquo;intelligent power,&rdquo; some people will call it God. What they knew it was mental energy, &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;E&rdquo; but what would mental energy do? So we find we are living in a seven dimensional universe and it has to have a direction so &ldquo;D&rdquo; stands for direction. (Someone enters the room.) You got a seat there? Audience: I have a seat now. Adano: They knew that the &ldquo;M&rdquo; was mental and &ldquo;E&rdquo; was energy but this mental energy had to move in some direction and they also knew that we live in a seven dimensional universe but there are more than seven dimensions, in fact there are 72 dimensions. We can&rsquo;t use them, it&rsquo;s a funny phenomena, we can only recognize seven, we can only use seven and it&rsquo;s a sub dimension but let&rsquo;s say we know that it&rsquo;s mental energy directing, directing where and to where? It has to go &ldquo;from&rdquo; &ldquo;to&rdquo; or &ldquo;to&rdquo; or &ldquo;from&rdquo; it can&rsquo;t move in any direction. So the &ldquo;I&rdquo; had to be individual, see &ldquo;M-E-D-I&rdquo; so it was moving from individually each one of us. Individual what? &ldquo;T&rdquo; stands for thought, the idea pattern, it had to move from the individual idea pattern which was thought and &ldquo;A&rdquo; which is the next letter &ldquo;M-E-D-I-T-A&rdquo; Actions see? The individual idea, activities, or actions this energy was moving from, but we say &ldquo;from&rdquo; &ldquo;to.&rdquo; Right? It can&rsquo;t just go like that &ldquo;from&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t go in any direction, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;from&rdquo; &ldquo;to&rdquo; it&rsquo;s always there in a 360 degree movement all the time. The &ldquo;T&rdquo; stands for Towards, towards what? It don&rsquo;t mean any sense as far as the Sages are concerned, as far as you would concern it would not have any value. &ldquo;I&rdquo; again stands for Intuitive. Now why intuitive not intelligent or not discrimination not the body, see as most Men would want to impress you? It&rsquo;s the intuitive, that means to the independence of the senses. You see this mental energy was moving from your individual thought activities to the intuitive, that is independent of the senses, why? The &ldquo;O&rdquo; represented Observation first. Remember we said meditation they tell you to analyze something and in some books they say there&rsquo;s meditation with seed or without seed, you&rsquo;ve read that term, or with an object or without an object, the &ldquo;O&rdquo; was Observation and Oneness. Now the scientist does not become one, he&rsquo;s always in the process of observing via the senses, the Mystic or the Saint is observing independent of the senses but He has an advantage over the scientists, He has the ability now to become one with, a state of oneness, with it. Some people call that Samadhi or &ldquo;at one with&rdquo; a state of oneness with, with what? So the obvious conclusion, we go to God but what is God, see? And all the writings say He is spirit and my Guru asked his Guru and his Guru asked my Guru, that&rsquo;s Sri Yuktsewar, &ldquo;What is God.&rdquo; So He said God is spirit then he says &ldquo;now what is spirit&rdquo; He says &ldquo;spirit is intelligence&rdquo; he says &ldquo;what is intelligence&rdquo; and we kept going around in circles. So we&rsquo;ll find out that the &ldquo;N&rdquo; at the last letter in meditation was nature Noumena and not Phenomena. So if we re-summarize what meditation is and as I said the four steps of divinity lie in the bedrock of meditation, we see the possible chances now to apply to ourselves. It&rsquo;s Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities because each one of us have to do this, we are all responsible now, no one is getting something for nothing, it&rsquo;s always something for something. Individual Thought Activities Towards Intuitive. that is independent of the senses, Observation and Oneness of Noumena, the full reality. Now in the bedrock of the four steps to divinity this science stands unchallenged because you couldn&rsquo;t challenge it, from every angle it&rsquo;s a science, from every angle it&rsquo;s philosophy, from every angle it&rsquo;s religion. You see it stands on challenge, it has the unity underlying it all. Now all religions find themselves standing in it, that is the ancient art of conscious sleep, the ancient art of conscious death, the ancient art of conscious resurrection, and the ancient art of conscious ascension all find itself anchored in meditation. For the first time now we can apply tangible methods to our daily lives, not in the monastery, right here and now in this room, right here in your own home, driving the car, eating your meals, and in fact I practiced mine in the bathroom sometime, practice where most people would think that God could not be. So there is no such thing as a space and time where this Divine Conscious Awareness does not exist, it is all now, see? 0:20 Now once we understand what meditation represents, we will see now how the first step to divinity is possible. I said before meditation is Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities Towards Intuitive, or independent of the senses, Observation and Oneness of nature Noumena not phenomena. We must realize the big difference between the noumena and phenomenon, we live in phenomena you know but that doesn&rsquo;t say it is so and we have no understanding so most of us take the least line of resistance. For centuries men took the least line of resistance in the search for noumena but the Sage was&hellip; the middle point of the three circles which I mentioned before, the outer circle represent the cafeteria type of student who was busy picking here and there from group, teacher, and so forth, the second ring represented those who will stick with one concept or one avenue, and the final inner ring were those who knew what it all meant and they began to work with it and I said before why women are drawn more to the process because of this tremendous suffering in their mechanism that put them there. So you&rsquo;ll find this is going to be all throughout the ages the body is so constructed, now the question is this someone, asked the Master says, &ldquo;Well Master then which is the ideal body to work in?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well the ideal body would be a male body,&rdquo; but a female body is stronger than a male body according to what I&rsquo;ve described, He says, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but He says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a hindrance in deep meditations because you don&rsquo;t want to get fouled up in the constant hygienics of cleaning the body and then you know that you have to stay away from people in the periods,&rdquo; the female body, &ldquo;so it interferes&rdquo; He said &ldquo;but in the early stages of your growth those pains and aches are essential strengths.&rdquo; So as Master experiments and evolves in many body forms to gain the momentum, finally choosing what is called a bisexual body having both forces united in Him, His body is polarized now, it has both a feminine quality of compassion and a masculine quality of justice and will. Audience: But this wasn&rsquo;t this the thing we exemplifier so beautifully in Jesus.&rdquo; Adano: Yes and the funny part of it you can tell by different limbs, different tonal skin tone, and texture and so forth, these are all the qualities blended. In the male He has the tremendous drive of will, tremendous broad shoulders, and you know big gut, and firm yet the female has the softness and the tenderness and the femininity of the fingers and the ears and eyes. So when these things are polarized in the Man, He&rsquo;s got both you see, so He&rsquo;s able to emanate devotion which is the love principle or the female principle out, He&rsquo;s able to emanate courage or this male principle when it&rsquo;s necessary for that particular student. A student may walk in the room and don&rsquo;t have courage and this may be a man or a woman and He has to emanate the male principle for that person and one will walk in and may need encouragement to devotion, may not be highly intellectual, yet the heart is yearning for awareness, so He has to emanate the female, so He has these two poles working all the time. Yes? Audience: I think you told me that when a child cries for gold did you give them that you give them an autumn leaf, this was uh Shinzoki, you know the man and many of these people that are looking for superiority of the male over female or the female over male are perhaps missing the point. Adano: I didn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re doing that, I said these things are polarized, there was no male over female here indicated in the discussion, it was a polarization that was emphasized. We are here to polarize ourselves, we&rsquo;re not here to say the male is over the female or the female is over the males, we are able to polarize. Each one of us is here to polarize the mechanism (inaudible). So this is what we are here to realize and it stems from understanding meditation, you see, if you understand meditation it will correct these conditions. The first step I mentioned was conscious sleep, the art of conscious sleep, this is one of the first steps in Divinity and what is Divinity, remember these are words we&rsquo;ve had, handed to us by many teachers but it never really worked because it always leaves us either in a state of abstinence, in a state of fear, in a state of mental shock, state of uh reticence, there is no awakening of an active life, a life of dominant work, creativity. Now there are two types, the type that retreat deep into themselves and the type that is stable. Now the Masters are emphasizing the polarization, not the over active type or the over reticence type, they&rsquo;re emphasizing the polarization of these two types you see. Now we are all on one side of the scale we have to find where we are you see, that&rsquo;s what we have to find, we have to find if we are over on one side and polarize ourselves. Now meditation helps us to bring about this polarization and the first attempt is conscious sleep, why conscious sleep? When you&rsquo;re asleep, deeply asleep, do anyone know who they really are? You&rsquo;re sound deep asleep, do you know if you&rsquo;re a man or a woman? You don&rsquo;t, so if you&rsquo;re not deeply asleep you have some indication of some-thing and that is a mental impression coming in through that mind frequency, so then you say you are dreaming. That doesn&rsquo;t say who you or doesn&rsquo;t say what you are, it doesn&rsquo;t say why you are if you dream, this is a playback of consciousness. We&rsquo;re trying to establish do you know who you are when you are sound asleep, so then you have no relationship, you have no conscious reaction. If you&rsquo;re unconscious then, this is not an ideal state to grow, to grow where, in Divinity. Now I said we must know what the word Divinity means before we can say we are growing in it. The whole of this cosmic experience, the totality of it is in a state of motion, spinning. It&rsquo;s not in a state&hellip; it&rsquo;s not stopped, it&rsquo;s spinning all the time, it&rsquo;s in movement. There is not one thing in this universe that can say it&rsquo;s stopped, it&rsquo;s in motion all the time. Right in this&hellip; between these two hands, there is millions and millions of things are in motion and this room you are bombarded by radio waves, electrical waves, television waves, thought waves, and everything, it is all here, there&rsquo;s no such thing as empty space, never was, never will be because it&rsquo;s conscious energy, but we don&rsquo;t know what this conscious energy represents to us and lack of the knowledge of it&rsquo;s reaction on us, we try to placate, or would you say, seek the next best solution out of weakness in consciousness. The next best solution would be &ldquo;God&rdquo; and we throw the burden on that name, you see? We don&rsquo;t relate this thing to ourselves that this name we call God in reality has become us, you see? But we are not God, this divinizing force, this spinning force has become us at certain rates or vibration, certain speeds. Now the speed of this flower is different than speed of this vase, the speed of this match is different than the speed of your body, my body, her body, chair, and everything, they&rsquo;re different speeds, speeds of what? Because if you take this body and you take the substance out of it which you call life, the vital power, it will decay and go back into where it came from, the original atomic structure, that is because a speed has been shuttered out of it a certain impulse has been broken. Now if you realize this is happening all around you then you see Divinity has really become us at a particular frequency for each one of us, so each one of us has a particular sound frequency. 0:30 Now it can be heard also it&rsquo;s ultrasonic, it can be heard, you see, and it&rsquo;s there. Now if something is wrong with you there&rsquo;s no sense&hellip; there are doctors who will try to heal you a certain way, we can look at you with the inner eye and see it, but no real Master would touch anything. In fact He will find the sound frequency and just correct it because He knows that the sound frequency is the whole thing. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt with Man.&rdquo; The Word was God, the Cosmic Principle or the Cosmic Divine Power is right here existing as us, It became us by different speeds. Now we don&rsquo;t know what we are when we&rsquo;re asleep and we&rsquo;re not conscious of it, so the Sages say this is not a wholesome state to demonize oneself or to live in, we must learn now something far more superior than that because what would sleep in an unconscious way give us? It only gives us within eight hours a sense of rebuilding the tissues, a sense of relaxation, peace, and uh you start all over next day with the same problems. So you go last night, tonight when you leave you&rsquo;re going to sleep out the problems and whatever crazy Adano says to you, that&rsquo;s as far as the brain will carry and forget it all because when you sleep you sleep it out, he&rsquo;s not in there, you wake up tomorrow and you start all over again, you see and this is a rat race going on all the time, we&rsquo;re not free, so we&rsquo;re stuck with the thing. This is unwholesome and this is degenerative but it doesn&rsquo;t say that you degenerate by a man drinking rum or something, fall on the ground he&rsquo;s degenerate, this is a degenerating process, it is tearing down the mechanism leading it to early decay, leading it to early frustrations, early breaking up of the inner mechanisms, because if this is atomic energy it should last and last, but it doesn&rsquo;t because we have degenerated so badly, not by bad foods alone you know or their thoughts, thinking degenerate the mechanism. Now we must realize that since sleep regenerates us a little, this is not so ideal, so the Sages say we must learn conscious sleep and conscious sleep a few minutes of it or an hour of it revitalize the equivalent of eight hours, it gives the body exactly what eight hours would do. Modern scientists have come along and says, &ldquo;Yes this is a fact, we now can take a machine, direct certain electrical waves, reveal the pituitary gland, and give you the equivalent of eight hours in a matter of one hour, electrical feedback&rdquo; knowing that this is an impulse already and knowing that you&rsquo;re an electrical impulse traveling at 186,000 miles per second square times 300 million so imagine how fast we are moving in this mechanism. It&rsquo;s fantastic that we don&rsquo;t realize its divinity, you see all these things add up eventually as we become aware of our environment. Now this is still God but He&rsquo;s not a person sitting on a throne because God is the Divine Simplicity and the Divine Law, out of that valid knowledge we get devotion, out of that devotion we get faith, so to believe&hellip; the Sages said to believe in something and not know what you&rsquo;re believing in would lead to superstition, to believe in non-violence knowledge or Avidya which is ignorance, the ignoring of law or principle, would lead to superstition, to believe in law or principle or truth would lead to devotion, would lead to faith, which is freedom. Now &ldquo;faith in Me like a grain of mustard seed, you say unto the mountain move&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t that a tremendous freedom, imagine moving a whole mountain when everybody has to take dynamite or other things to move it, you see, but we don&rsquo;t have to go and demonstrate that to ourselves, these are terms relating on facts concerning ourselves, conscious sleep then is an important step and is the first step. Now we need a technique, you just can&rsquo;t have a principle without a technique to apply it, this would be highly impractical even in this day and age where we are living we need techniques to do things, so nothing is wrong in technique, just as prayer is a technique, it&rsquo;s a technique of thought transmission to activate the cosmos to bring about and manifest in your life what you need. So I just as well say I am sending out thought waves to someone who has a particular thing that I need and soon they will pick up that message and they&rsquo;ll bring it and it&rsquo;s an answer to my prayer. I say God did it, yes God did it but God is the totality of the frequencies, the power, the magnification, but person-to-person brain communication was prayer you see but prayer as we see it now has dimension, it has value now, it becomes something of reverence, something of quality, it&rsquo;s not just, &ldquo;Our Father help me&rdquo; and so forth you know, it is the fact that you know now that you emit powerful charges of forces from your mechanism that you are composed of, traveling at the speed of light, and the earth is only five to seven thousand miles wide you know, so imagine the speed of light is traveling 186,000 miles a second so it doesn&rsquo;t take that long for a thought wave to get across the the width of the planet and back, you see how your thought waves are? Now this is only one speed of light, thought waves are moving faster than that, faster than the speed of light. Now the light coming from the sun takes four and a half minutes to hit the earth so that planet has moved from its position four and a half minutes and the light is traveling four and a half minutes behind it, by the time it hits you, you are seeing light so if this measurement seems to be out of the normal range of the five senses, it&rsquo;s possible now to recognize that within the human being the high potentialities if this consciousness was accelerated, He would be partaking so that&rsquo;s why He says, &ldquo;I have made Man in My own image&rdquo; that is atomic principles, Man is a living atomic principle, he&rsquo;s a living miniature universe. Now his aim is cosmic consciousness but that&rsquo;s the just the beginning of his existence, we are moving towards cosmic consciousness not as the end, as the completion of our evolution, but not the completion of our existence. Theoretically we evolve up to cosmic consciousness, which is our Divinity of ourselves, from there on we must move on to cosmic existence with our neighbors in the cosmos. See, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house there are many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you, if it were not I&rsquo;d tell you&rdquo; so He was speaking already of cosmic existence in relation to cosmic evolution. Conscious sleep is the first step to revitalize this body consciously and recognize that you have access to this force passing through you, it enters the body via the medulla oblongata and the moment we take electrical charges and hook it in, we activate it and we have the same identical thing happening in the body, we can verify it for ourselves now, we don&rsquo;t have to assume it is there, it is there now. Now the next thing is if you can regenerate your body in one eighth of the time or a fourth of the time, it gives you more impetus and at the same time it shows there are more potentials possible from within the mechanism that has not been tapped and if we can tap the other potentials then we can use this consciousness now for the first time in its natural state, not in some fairy land, here in this mechanistic world. We can bring our conscious attitude into focus, we can now have an attitude that is entirely different, that is not degenerating the mechanism, but is constantly regenerating the mechanism and keeping it at a high level which you call spiritual height, projecting it out consciously. 0:40 Now to practice conscious sleep normally you lie in the back but you would have a tendency to go back into the subconscious state and we don&rsquo;t want to accomplish that, we want to maintain conscious control that&rsquo;s why an astronaut is trained in the processes of all these things, he&rsquo;s learning consciously. In fact more is going on in an astronaut&rsquo;s training than any monk in any monastery has had, in fact they&rsquo;re catching up with the monk and soon they may leave the monk with his old antiquated approach to conscious application of these forces and we will soon see an underlying unity. The terminologies we will use will have a more cosmic expression and value, you see? Now to sit straight with the spine straight and close the eyes&hellip; now normally when you sleep you close your eyes and if you&rsquo;re going to accomplish the relaxation that you want in sleep, you don&rsquo;t tell yourself I want to go to sleep and be strong and healthy, you don&rsquo;t even tell your mind anything, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to go to sleep&rdquo; you see and you do that and forget about it. In this conscious process the least resistance you offer the better but it&rsquo;s under the control of your will as an individual. For the first time you&rsquo;re experiencing something on your own not so somebody tells you that it&rsquo;s so, you can experience it on your own and you have done this many times on your own, &ldquo;I will get up at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning&rdquo; and you set the alarm clock and two minutes or three minutes before you&rsquo;re always up before the clock goes off, so if the brain reacts like that, you see that this triggering agent is in us already. Now positive prayer, positive thinking, positive attitude all have their origin in the basic truth if we can go back to it and use it, see? So if you keep the spine straight and you gaze at the point between the eyebrows, just for a few minutes (Meditation). Now slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move and observe the same peace and the same drowsy effect you would normally observe if you&rsquo;re waking up out of unconscious sleep. Now you notice the body seems to have shut down, seems to get a little heavy, numb, and relaxed, and yet you feel pepped up in consciousness because your consciousness seems to widen out. For the first time it has expanded beyond the range of the body, it&rsquo;s no longer identified with the body. This is what occurs after eight hours sleep in the mechanism, you go through eight hours of sleep and the body will toss hundreds of times in the bed, un-knowing to you and it will in any event have this soothing, rebuilding effect in the mechanism. Now to use this, where would they use such a knowledge? We&rsquo;re evolving you know, we&rsquo;re not going to stand still and walk around like with long coats and long beards you know, we&rsquo;re here to live and we&rsquo;re here to advance in evolution because we have our destiny to complete. In our waking state in which we live and perform our duties we need methods to constantly revitalize us, independent of drugs or food, see one can use a drug and have a tranquilizing effect or one can accept some food and have the same effect, but you can&rsquo;t be eating all the time and you can&rsquo;t be taking tranquilizing drugs all the time, so you need now definite methods that the mechanism has locked up in it via the principle of self-acceleration. You see you&rsquo;ve self-accelerated this condition out from the mechanism, this particular feeling of new strength, new vitality, but where is that strength actually existing, in the atmosphere all around you via the breath, via the pressures, and via the sense awareness. So we say &ldquo;I went to bed and slept very soundly and God was watching over me,&rdquo; yes God was watching over you because you have no fear when you lie in the bed, nobody&rsquo;s gonna break in the house. So you were sleeping in God, in the totality of life, in an unconscious way, now in a conscious way you are directly linking up with Him or linking up with the Force via self-effort, see? Now self-effort leads to self-improvement, self-improvement is naturally raising you to a higher level to function as a being in this cosmos. Yet in as much as you recognize these simple principles and their ramifications, from within us we trigger off different emotional tones, different emotional moods or gestures triggered off by conditions around us that agitate us. So we have to block it in order to get along with with conditions, in order to maintain an even keel. 0:50 Now the boss may come in and dissatisfy with the work you did, you have a chance to be one of two things, the temperature either rise or lowers itself, so if it rise you become a hot head and you act back, if the temperature lows itself you keep cool and as they say &ldquo;cool as a cucumber&rdquo; you let him talk out his wind, sooner or later you realize what is happening. Now the Sages show right in the mechanism we don&rsquo;t alter the environment, we alter ourselves by the temperature ratios within ourselves we now correct all the magnetic repulsion and attractions upon us. Now if conscious sleep that we just did does a certain portion of this self-correcting already, then consciously we can call it up in an automatic way by thinking of it and the mechanism would feel the same way as light, cool down, relaxed, just as if you had sat down and did 10 or 15 minutes of it, it becomes automatic after because you have worked your way in to the source of the current and you have exerted the will upon that current, that current knowledge becomes psychosomatic construction, not psychosomatic destruction or breakdown. See and it starts to vibrate through the cells, vibrating through the cells, the cells perk up and you say, &ldquo;Gee whiz that person never get tired, never get angry, is there any way we can really dig at him and work at him?&rdquo; The other person would get angry because they are trying to break at the mechanism that is learned to adjust to every condition and this is what we do you see. The Sages point this out as the most practical road to Divinity, the first step being conscious sleep. Now the next step is called conscious death, now this word death is going to scare many of us because most of us are in a sense afraid of the word let alone the fact that it indicates termination of a mechanism and indicate a loss of identity, the word death these are the connotations that it drums up in the consciousness. When it&rsquo;s pointed out that there is no such thing then we can now self-accelerate ourselves consciously faster, you see? Now one of the testimonies of conscious death and its result is a non-decaying body, now this is a phenomenon brought on strictly by the volition upon the life stream via the mechanism to perform certain work. Now in the world of men who ignore the law of truth such an individual will be revered as a Saint, a Holy Man, we must accept that for that level of development but we must see this is a cosmic heritage, a cosmic goal, locked up in the mechanism that all men are heir too, this is a part of their evolution. Now in time we will alter these functions and extend the life principle of conscious life and conscious death via temperature controls. Now how we do this? One simple technique of getting close to what is called conscious death, that is having in sleep you don&rsquo;t breathe, but you breathe right? I saw your face, I want to see your reaction, we breathe when we sleep but very slow, our heartbeat was very slow, but our five senses don&rsquo;t function in an unconscious way, the muscular functions are pretty rigid, you can lift them up and drop them. Now in hypnosis we see the similar relationship but hypnosis is not what we&rsquo;re intending to do, we&rsquo;re just trying to point out the underlying principles that connect themselves and see now where this thing is leading us, what it&rsquo;s all intended for, these are only steps, they are not the goal so we must realize what we&rsquo;re doing. Now we will notice in sleep we don&rsquo;t move around the mechanism too much, although we toss in the bed, but we are not conscious of that, the five senses don&rsquo;t work, so we have unconscious sensory motor relaxation in sleep, you&rsquo;re unconscious, your sensory functions are shut down or relaxed, and the motor functions are relaxed. In conscious sleep what we just did, we did the same thing, you were conscious of what you were doing, the sensory motor functions were shut down, and the body was relaxed, the end result being the same, revitalization. Now in death without any control by a bullet or hitting your head on something or dying in any form, we have what is called unconscious, the person doesn&rsquo;t know, sensory motor the five senses motor function, organic that means lungs and heart have shut down, but we say that this is not the end, because the life is not in the heart, the heart is only a pump which we have degenerated, not regenerated, we have degenerated, so it gives up, the life is always dormant in the medulla via the spinal canal. Now in ancient Sages would call, it was called kundalini and they say it was like a snake, the Sages would laugh but They would not interfere because Man has to unwind and find the truth. There is no kundalini, there is no snake in the spine, it is simply individualized life current stored up there in a residual way and precipitated, awaiting to be released out of there by the slow process of decomposition, now we see we have transmuting, the cells are changing from one to another in the process of change. Conscious death would be the ability then to shut down the five senses, slowly eliminate the respiratory function, not by forcing it, by a natural shutdown, and at the same time lungs and heart would shut down and the life current would slip now via the medulla and step out. For the first time you will feel like you&rsquo;re two individuals, there&rsquo;s a lighter you transparent and I a heavier you sitting and reclining, now this is possible. Now it is also based on the very fundamental technique of meditation, the mental energy being directed independent of the senses, you see it&rsquo;s always independent and stepping out. For the first time you step out and you get what is called a split in two parts, you see one part is pure light and you feel it, and the other part is here with you. Now there is a linkage, just like McDivitt stepped out of the satellite and was hooked in by an umbilical cord to feed him from the satellite, when we step out in a conscious way, not unconsciously, we have the same connection. Now this is not a permanent way, now Saint Paul says in his period, during his time, &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing because I live and die daily in the Lord&rdquo; and the Lord being the Cosmic Principle, &ldquo;I know the art of conscious shutting down the mechanism and stepping out, verifying myself that I am Cosmic Light, I am the Cosmic Life, and I&rsquo;m not the body&rdquo; the body is like a suit. Now we need to verify this because of the tremendous fears that follow us in death. Now the fears that follow us in death is that we&rsquo;re worried about going to a hell or heaven you know, some dungeon and the Bardos of the Tibetan books will tell you some Guru will be there to show you through these hells that you&rsquo;ve created, no one has created it, these are actually ideas patterns of your own thinking waiting for you to see yourself. Now Omar Khayyam would say, &ldquo;I sent my Soul out into the invisible,&rdquo; this is the invisible right? &ldquo;I sent my Soul out into the invisible, a letter&rdquo; or an information &ldquo;of the afterlife&rdquo; that is what goes on here in the invisible &ldquo;to spell, by and by my Soul&rdquo; this life principle &ldquo;came back and said, &lsquo;I myself I&rsquo;m heaven and hell.&rsquo;&rdquo; Now you see it is not possible to take Omar Khayyam&rsquo;s concept and fit them in, you see that conscious death then is a natural approach or second step in our Divinity, we&rsquo;re getting in our second step or second phase. 1:00 Now to do that we still need to meditate, we have to fit the meditation, now Jesus said to Jairus&rsquo;s daughter when He walked in the room, &ldquo;She is not dead, she&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo; He used sleep and didn&rsquo;t say death you see and Jairus says, &ldquo;My daughter is dead,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;no she&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo; Now you mean to tell me this Man would actually make such a statement unless He knew the principles, what was involved in the Divinity. He had to know the differences that what we will call death and what is called sleep, real death we don&rsquo;t see because we don&rsquo;t know what it is yet, we&rsquo;re going to see phases of sleep and different degrees. So they call it the great sleep and poets love to embellish natural laws and lead us in us out of our reverie, it is good, don&rsquo;t get me wrong I&rsquo;m not knocking the poet, it is good when you have valid knowledge behind to back up, it will cultivate devotion and love for such a principle, but until you have the valid knowledge, then the reverie can lead to superstition. All right if we know that we can consciously step out, we will feel a separation and this conscious separation that goes on must be cultivated, it&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, just as McDivitt was not afraid to step out of the satellite and in fact he didn&rsquo;t want to come back in and those who have the experience of stepping out of this body form, like taking off this jacket and pulling it off, don&rsquo;t want to go back into it, but that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re here for, to run away from the body, it&rsquo;s just like trying to run away to the monastery to live and not facing the problems or the opportunities to fail and succeed in life. If you run from something, sooner or later it will find you in another angle because your mechanism attracts or repel. So we&rsquo;re not here to run away, this mechanism has what is called a time clock measurement when it will automatically sever itself, like a pregnant mother knows it takes nine months for a baby to give birth and the pregnant period is over they sever it. We have a period, time clock periods, locked up in this mechanism for this Soul principle to grow, that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t exhibit cosmic consciousness if the thing is not complete. When it&rsquo;s complete and you have the experience then you have the choice of going out, time clock the physicians on the other side will cut the umbilical cord, leave you on the other plane, or you come back in and you have some work to do to lift up your fellow Man with their problems, then this is again a spiritual volunteering. There is no spiritual drafting, you know they say we have the draft card, but there is a draft principle too, but we don&rsquo;t go into that, tonight we are going to show why the volunteering of one&rsquo;s life in the function of truth is more important. Now let us close our eyes for a moment and slowly feel yourself separating, all right, and this is done consciously, you don&rsquo;t have somebody knock you on the head to make you experience, you have to cultivate this principle. Now you&rsquo;ll notice you&rsquo;ll breathe very slowly and you&rsquo;ll notice there comes a time when you notice that you&rsquo;re not breathing (gap in tape) &hellip;of the heaviness of the body and notice the distinct difference between your consciousness and the body. You&rsquo;ll notice it feels like prickly or it feels pretty numb or like electrical frequency and you&rsquo;ll notice it has like a goose pimple sensation, sometimes hot and cold in the spine. Also you&rsquo;ll notice that for a brief moment your breath stopped and you jerked to bring the breath back because the frequency is not cut, this is one of the phenomenas you encounter as you cultivate the attitude of stepping out and why some of us could not step out completely, it&rsquo;s not because of fear, it&rsquo;s because of shame. Now we want to say &ldquo;why shame?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not going to shock you but it&rsquo;s the truth, the more you cover the body with garments, the more attached you are to garments. Now if anyone was to walk in the room and you were taking a shower and you came out of the bath, the first thing you would grab a towel to wrap yourself, not because you&rsquo;re afraid, you feel that you&rsquo;re exposed and nude so you do this gesture by the mere mechanical movement indicates an idea impression, an idea attachment to hide oneself which we say is the fall of Man, he felt a sense of shame that&rsquo;s why he hid himself from his Creative Consciousness, he didn&rsquo;t want to step out. Now the more you lose this sense of shame you will see that the body is also a suit over the life principle, God, and you will step out and see light and you&rsquo;ll always feel light and you&rsquo;ll feel a distinct separateness, it pulsates all the time, you want to get this principle to go in you. Some people think you&rsquo;re gonna see three, four different forms running somewhere around in the universe, we&rsquo;re talking something more exact in pulsation, this force steps out, you carry your consciousness with it, you carry the vital impressions, and you see it there and you work from it. Now we have a link just like the satellite had a link to that astronaut that stepped out, he is able to work now on that satellite, he&rsquo;s able to work in this dimension. Now we&rsquo;re not trying to say that you&rsquo;re going to go away into some astral realm (inaudible), the Master is not trying to do that, the first place there&rsquo;s one girl, she came there and she said, &ldquo;Master I go on astral realms,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Stop it, you would be like drowning in the middle of the ocean and have nothing to guide you. Come back and learn this mechanism, come back and learn the truth about what we&rsquo;re talking about. Start meditating, start vibrating, start cultivating the energies to vibrate out and feel this distinct separateness, feel this freedom that separates us, and that we don&rsquo;t fear and we don&rsquo;t have these reactions in the cells when we&rsquo;re stepping out, pains and aches, we&rsquo;re going out in a natural way.&rdquo; So He emphasized the need of the meditation to awaken this consciousness to it. Now the third step leads to conscious resurrection, what are you resurrecting? This body, also some have had their body burnt up and cremated and they resurrect and have been seen and a resurrected body is flesh and blood, it&rsquo;s not an apparition, it is knowledge of the same atomic law here by acceleration now and by consciousness. Now the Masters say death is unnatural to the body, it&rsquo;s a disease, it is not a natural function to the body, but because we haven&rsquo;t learned enough about it we have to go through it and we&rsquo;ll vacate it via that method and sometimes They leave a body specifically just to show it can&rsquo;t rot. Now if it can&rsquo;t rot then it automatically tells you can resurrect it, so They use various examples to indicate to us of its tremendous potential. To resurrect it They make us conscious that each cell is a living universe, a living world in itself, and we have billions of them, and it&rsquo;s impregnated with vital power and this vital power is the universal Christ Consciousness or Kutastha Chaitanya. 1:10 Now we say the Christ in Man &ldquo;If I be lifted up, all men are lifted up also.&rdquo; Now we have to resurrect this principle, we have to lift this consciousness via this mechanism all the time knowing that this body is not degenerating, it&rsquo;s regenerating. By keeping conscious of the fact it regenerates, it&rsquo;s lifting itself, it&rsquo;s drawing from the forces around and revitalizing itself from the forces around, being coaxed by the conscious mind, being coaxed by the attitude of love and reverence for all life now, this is resurrected or revitalized, it&rsquo;s lifted up and it&rsquo;s pulled up and it starts to vibrate and pulsate. Now the strange phenomenon of it is this, there comes a time when one will notice, occasionally he stand in front of a mirror, he doesn&rsquo;t have a shadow and he wants to know what happened to him, that&rsquo;s occasionally, it has happened within his mechanism but not all the time, he has to still go through a certain phenomena or condition to vacate the frame in death to make the final transition of this principle. It&rsquo;s strange yet they say death is a hindrance (inaudible) yet only by mastering death, this principle seems to round out itself, you understand, and it&rsquo;s the same person who sat here with flesh and blood (inaudible) by constantly resurrecting this principle consciously, meditating and pulling these energies, vitalizing the spine, occasionally have this experience that you see one day he doesn&rsquo;t have an image on the screen. You know what you do, you say you&rsquo;re a vampire, you&rsquo;ll call yourself a vampire, the undead, that&rsquo;s the name they gave to people who would not stay dead for centuries but that&rsquo;s a name only, actually these things are all part of cosmic law, we must not get carried away with the word vampire either, I&rsquo;m just showing you one of the strange functions of nature within the mechanism that we come to that inner consciously while in the body. Some Saints have had this experience in Themselves. Now the mechanism is revved up and vitalized and it has this sensation of performing and strange phenomena too occasionally, and I said occasionally, it would not leave a footprint, that same solid body would not leave a footprint. Now Lahiri Mahasaya demonstrated this all the time because every time they photographed Him there was no registration on the camera, so if you can&rsquo;t photograph Him and He&rsquo;s a living Man eating food, his wife is cooking for him, he has two healthy sons, I that is quite a feat. So then He tells you that the technique is to revitalize the energy and constantly feel it and He gives a technique which is called Kriya, now when you get the Kriya technique it revitalizes the spine and pull these forces in. Now those who have read the Autobiography and those who know anything concerning life will realize that if you photograph this person at a certain frequency there wouldn&rsquo;t be no shadow, so there is no impression because there&rsquo;s a clear channel of light passing through His mechanism yet He looks like you and He eats and everything and it&rsquo;s strange phenomena you can&rsquo;t understand are you living in the presence of a living Man or is it a conditioned body brought on by the consciousness to stay there and to function, you see the tremendous problem you have? You don&rsquo;t know if He&rsquo;s there or He&rsquo;s not there, yet He is there He&rsquo;s eating and this is one of the phenomena. Now it&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, it&rsquo;s something we have to realize is our nature, He is only an example, these examples are like beacons on an ocean of consciousness so we don&rsquo;t run into the rocks of indifference with our boat which is our body, we have to realize that they are examples and They have a way to arrive at that, He gave a definite technique and within a given time you can have this particular experience. Now He knows that once you had the experience then all the fears of death is gone long time, all the after states become the living existence, for the first time these states are there. Now He&rsquo;s not trying to tell you to run away from yourself, He&rsquo;s trying to build this all the time, right here, temple of the Living God, &ldquo;Here work this, build this, don&rsquo;t go away from it, build this, reconstruct it, emanate it, let it vibrate&rdquo; because it will lead to ascension and ascension means deathlessness. Now we have a Guru, two of them, one demonstrated ascension while on the Earth and that&rsquo;s the Master Jesus and the other one demonstrated by the same principle without dying, He&rsquo;s keeping the body for another thousand years as a testimony of the principle and that&rsquo;s the Mahavatar Babaji, the final technique is ascension. Now we ascend within ourselves very slowly, unknowing to ourselves the energy rises, by the law of gravity it goes down and rises up, goes down rises up, goes down rises up, but it&rsquo;s rising so slow by this principle of natural evolution that it will take you a million years to have glimpses of what ascension can be in the mechanism. Now we don&rsquo;t have a million years, we don&rsquo;t know of anybody living a million years, so it means that this Man if He says He will live for another thousand years and He says He&rsquo;s over several thousand years old already, so we got another phenomena, a problem here of confronting us with the truth. It is here, it&rsquo;s not imagination, it&rsquo;s in the realm of atomic principles because all the atomic principles are here, God didn&rsquo;t make anything new, they&rsquo;re all here, nothing new under the sun, it&rsquo;s right here, but we don&rsquo;t know how to accelerate it. Now the Guru has pointed out how this acceleration is possible and He points it out in simple ways, He&rsquo;s not trying to make you run away in some caves to practice it, He&rsquo;s pointing it out as simple things because God is simple, that is the Truth is simple if you can stick it out and apply it. Now in the spine we have this energy that rises but it rises very slow, now when your consciousness is anchored in with it, when your consciousness is anchored or united with it, with this energy, then it will rise, not before then it can&rsquo;t rise. You can have many other mystical experiences and have nothing to do with ascension, this consciousness has to link itself with the energy and rise. Now we get glimpses of it in ourselves occasionally, of it making a movement in the spine, you ever walk in the room and you feel out of place and you feel your whole body vibrate and it goes so fast and come down back, it travels so fast that your mind cannot keep up with it, the energy is moving even faster than your mind staying, the two can&rsquo;t seem to go together, one seems to outrun the other, that is the life principle seems to out run the mind principle and they never seem to stay together. If they stay together, you will surprise yourself because there are many things that will occur in the two staying together but we don&rsquo;t stay together so we do have glimpses of it and that we realized it is something that has to be cultivated. Now when the individual goes through this principle of raising it or ascending in the spinal column and correcting this mechanism now, the first manifestation is extension of life in the body, you begin to extend the life principle in your body, the decay principle is arrested you see. Now Kriya as a science by its very initial start, starts to prevent or lessen the decay of the tissues by added oxygen taken into the mechanism and the atoms of those oxygen are transmitted into pure energy, the pure energy now revitalize the mechanism and causes it to ascend and so we say the extension of the life principle is carried on now. Doctors not too long ago before I left California were experimenting on the principle and we were the working observation, they came up with the fact that if they alter the temperature of a certain object or plant or animal or creature within a given span, they can extend the life principle and slow down the breakdown rate, the temperature, and if they alter the food intake, they can also alter that condition now. 1:20 So they&rsquo;re showing that it makes no difference what you eat or what you think, certain conditions can be altered to bring about a change, but they&rsquo;re not trying to say that you should not follow a specified regime to eat because then it is also an impractical attitude too. They must be balanced and everything in this universe is balanced and we live in the mechanism and many of us don&rsquo;t pass that condition but this is not for somebody who&rsquo;s gone past any conditions, it&rsquo;s for something who is here to work on his mechanism. Now the question is this, if we regulate our food intake, we give the the mechanism a little more rest, it doesn&rsquo;t work as heavy or as hard, and if we regulate the temperatures we allow the body to vibrate, but the Sages say that is using your will, that is not going according to cosmic will, they don&rsquo;t want you to do it that way, they want you to work according to cosmic will, they want you to alter your mechanism to the environment at all times. In other words if this room is hot and you walk in and everybody&rsquo;s irritable, you should automatically adjust and you can be cool when everybody&rsquo;s hot. Audience: Can you do that by will? Adano: Right, you want it from within yourself, you don&rsquo;t want to change that hot room by putting in a refrigerator, you don&rsquo;t want to change the cool room by putting in fire, you want to change this mechanism by consciousness now from within yourself, see? You want to make this change any time, any place, and work because what is the purpose? The principles are not to flaunt around like play things, they are for a purpose to work for what? The next individual who is ill with his problems, his immediate needs and sufferings, you being in a better control of your own mechanism now can help him overcome his problems, this is what we call the selfless service. Now there&rsquo;s a reason for that, a very valid reason for the selfless service, if you constantly heal one or the two or three of the individuals sooner or later you get involved in personalities, but when you have adjusted this mechanism, the only healing that is real or valid or the only prayer that is real and valid is the emanating of life via your mechanism to all levels of existence, that is for the elemental kingdom, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, the human kingdom, and the spiritual kingdom, and within yourself. Yes? Audience: Are you familiar with the Zen stories that are quite pertinent to this. I mean I&rsquo;m only trying to validate what you said that the Zen Master was approached by His student, &ldquo;this weather&rsquo;s terrible what are we going to do about it&rdquo; and the Zen Master said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the land where there is neither hot nor cold&rdquo; and the student said &ldquo;where is that?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;in the winter shiver, in the summer sweat.&rdquo; Is this pertinent to what you&rsquo;re saying? Adano: No, you see that is not pertinent to what I&rsquo;m saying because in the winter shiver, you didn&rsquo;t actually adjust, because I can shiver but this is not adjustment because shivering is not an actual function of my mechanism, it is a function brought on because a lack of knowledge of the mechanism, you see? A lack of the knowledge of the mechanism would make you shiver when the temperature drops, well what you&rsquo;re trying to do is not&hellip; if cold is the result of an electrical field and hot is a result of an electrical field and they&rsquo;re all electrons and your body is an electronic field, we have polarities, ice will float on water, you&rsquo;re making an adjustment, you&rsquo;re making &ldquo;this room is cold,&rdquo; you have to function, if you&rsquo;re going to shiver you&rsquo;re not functioning, you can come in the room, adjust the mechanism and work while the man is shivering and thinking he&rsquo;s doing the right thing to be in the environment. So I am part of the environment what is that serving me? The Master says that is not serving any purpose, the real purpose is to work you understand? The real purpose is to get in there and work. Now if a man is dying there and I&rsquo;m shivering like hell, how can I work on that man if I&rsquo;m a doctor? How can I dig this guy out from the ground if the the building is caving in, I have to work. So if I have to work that means if I have to do my immediate karmic condition or principle, I must have the mechanism that adjusts at all times to permit me to work, you see. If it&rsquo;s hot I&rsquo;m sweating, all right I&rsquo;m sweating, but that doesn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re not part of the environment, doesn&rsquo;t say your body is not in the same heat wave frequency, well are you working? Are you functioning objectively? There&rsquo;s a big difference in fitting into the environment just to be the environment than to fit into an environment and function objectively because we&rsquo;re not here for that, we&rsquo;re here to function. See this is where all the Masters have pointed out that we must function, we must render service, you see? The mere fact that you breathe is service already. Now we don&rsquo;t realize why we have this limitation, now I&rsquo;m not trying to say that if you go in a room you&rsquo;re not going to perspire if the room is hot, but is that a practical state? It is the state in which the room requires you to be, but it doesn&rsquo;t say it is practical for you to function as a human being because you are still the highest form which the Life Principle works through and that highest form is to correct things, not to dominate them, to correct them in relation to your consciousness. So a man is sick and that&rsquo;s where you use the principles, a sick man is here and the room is cold, we know if you don&rsquo;t control him first, he will die, Now we have a choice, we can heal the man immediately by the cosmic principle or obey the natural law and work by adjusting our mechanism and working with the man, take him out and go through the normal, natural routine of healing him by the natural way. Now we&rsquo;re not supposed to go and impress the individual that we are acquainted with these higher principles by touching him on the head and healing him, we have that right but when we usurp that right we also incur the karma and remember Jesus or any great Master would not do these things unless there was a karmic link with that person in a past life or some formation with it, He had to be linked to that person to do these things. He doesn&rsquo;t just go around like mass production and do these things, there are reasons. I&rsquo;m trying to point out the Gurus are saying if you lift this energy in, in your mechanism daily, sooner or later you begin to adjust and you have the mechanism to work. If you don&rsquo;t have a mechanism to work, then all right &ldquo;the trees are falling, let us all lie down,&rdquo; sooner or later it&rsquo;s a jungle. &ldquo;The water is overrunning the dam, let us all swim along with the water,&rdquo; sooner or later you break up everything. Man is a functioning mechanism yet Man has a right to raise his mechanism, he has a right to be a Saint just as much as he has a right to be a progressive evolving mechanism, you see? Now the Sages are saying there&rsquo;s an underlying unity, in your spiritual life you must have these forces working inside of you, in your material life you must have it taking care to give you the balance because we are imbalanced. In the West we have too much material abundance but lack of inner control, in the East we have too much inner control but lack of material control. So this is an imbalance, this is upside down evolution. Now if this is an upside down evolution, now what are we here for? You don&rsquo;t need me and I wouldn&rsquo;t need you, we don&rsquo;t need&hellip; actually what do you need to listen to me, you go out and you make more money every day you work in this environment you make more money to pay for your needs, but is that functioning? And all right you sit in a monastery and you have all the inner powers in you, when you can&rsquo;t fit in the outside world, is that functioning. So you see we realize Cosmic Consciousness has more to offer and Cosmic Existence has more to offer. Now if the Sages remained, and I said if the Sages remained, stagnant then the whole of humanity would be stagnant, They are not remaining stagnant, They are constantly vibrating, They are constantly vibrating to less evolved people because They see that all is part of life, They see that you have an invention to manifest and They know it. 1:30 It&rsquo;s not Their job to manifest it but they see you need the necessary encouragement to pursue on the path, just that other man has a right to do certain things, each one has got something to do to make up the whole. The Saint is in one point vibrating, He&rsquo;s vibrating so as much as you receive He&rsquo;s vibrating to you, He&rsquo;s not interfering, He knows His mechanism but He knows by a certain karmic link He has to help certain people past a given point in the Divinity. Their fear of their death, the certain fears of after death, and so forth and sickness, He has to ease those conditions so that that person can function, you see? Now we realize that if we don&rsquo;t function this way, we bring chaos into our lives and this is the thing that is happening to us, we are bringing the chaos by malfunctioning in the mechanism, we are bringing chaos by not establishing our right to truth. Now Jesus would say, &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly,&rdquo; that means in all phases of existence, it&rsquo;s not just the wishing washing or crawling over each other, this is a function that is projected upon you. Now if you don&rsquo;t take on your responsibility in this function, then you have automatically gone through what is called a denial process, life is renouncing you, you are not renouncing life, whenever you don&rsquo;t seem to function in this world correctly, it&rsquo;s not you who are renouncing by running from it, life itself is renouncing you because she would not, Mother Nature would not, vibrate to you if you don&rsquo;t fit the process. So we know why the Master Jesus and all these Masters point out that life must function abundantly in all phases, it must. Now your attitude via these phases is an abundant principle too, your attitude all the time, now the attitude is the winding up process, it&rsquo;s the cornerstone of the growth, it&rsquo;s the final fruit of the growth. You start out with an attitude of meditation which is conscious sleep, you graduate to conscious death, you graduate to the next conscious resurrecting, and you graduate to the conscious ascending. Now this is where the mechanism is supposed to arrive before it can work, that doesn&rsquo;t say this is the end of our evolution, this is just where we have to come to work now, we are servitors in what? Cosmic Existence. Now if Man is just reaching out for the first time on planet Earth to space colonization, space location, this process is an indication of his destiny already. Now cosmic men knew this, they can go any place anytime back and forth, but they knew that it would be in balance if you only went via one method and didn&rsquo;t go by the other method because the laws of life don&rsquo;t leave imbalances. Man must have his development evenly balanced out, so while he is evolving physically, he has to evolve mentally, and he has to evolve spiritually, but it&rsquo;s easier to evolve spiritually than it is to evolve materially or in the physical plane because it&rsquo;s easy to withdraw from the responsibilities of the world, hide in a cave, look at yourself and say &ldquo;well the world has treated me in a rough way, I don&rsquo;t need the world, I can sit down and be, and I sit down and be.&rdquo; Yes it&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s good, you come home to yourself, but you&rsquo;ll never find none of the Masters staying there because They get up and go out, every one of these men after they came back to their inner self, got up and worked. So we say, &ldquo;Greater than the man of action, greater than the man of devotion, great than the man of meditation or wisdom, is the man of conscious activity, the Realized man. He is consciously active all the time, He&rsquo;s not running, He&rsquo;s here, He&rsquo;s working, He sees and anticipates in consciousness, He is living, He&rsquo;s not afraid you see, He knows where He&rsquo;s going. Now He infuses you with strength all the time and the first thing in any evolution or freedom in this evolution is courage and strength, if you don&rsquo;t got it, you ain&rsquo;t got it, and then you&rsquo;re suffering with the weaknesses. If you&rsquo;ve got the weaknesses and you don&rsquo;t have the courage to face up now where you are and work, you can&rsquo;t go to the next freedom. Now the next freedom is freedom from hate, which is love, cosmic love, everything has to be cosmic love. Now after you graduate from that next freedom, you go into what is called enlightenment, freedom from the ignorance, the ignoring of the laws of life. You begin now to function with the laws of life and as you free yourself from that ignorance, then comes on your illumination, your cosmic nature concerning Man on this planet. Now the first experience in your cosmic nature would be social cosmic consciousness via tourism, your interest in Man as a whole, not just you yourself, most of us run away and hide in a cave looking for our own cosmic consciousness for ourselves, this is also self-interest, this is also ego, it&rsquo;s not cosmic realization. You see the Masters are pointing out we don&rsquo;t want the cosmic consciousness for the world, we want it for ourselves, we want to know we have something in ourselves that is unique, it&rsquo;s not true. This is a natural law that will come regardless of ourselves when we are ready for it too, that is by the grace of God it descends in us, this is a principle that the Christian Saints have transcended, They have willingly allowed the grace of God to pour down you see? They did not go out to look for the thing for themselves personally, They wanted the thing to come down from on high. Now the second phase of this cosmic consciousness will be when you sit down in your home wherever you are and step out and recognize the duality, recognize the twofold part of your bein, when you do that, sooner or later you are able to have this whole awareness and see it. Now having it isn&rsquo;t having it for all mankind because if you know that &ldquo;thou shalt have none other Gods but Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; then you see that your own self is locked up in the other individual and it&rsquo;s struggling in a body form. Though you know that you&rsquo;re everything, that doesn&rsquo;t say that form in which you are temporarily imprisoned by the thought block is functioning correctly, you see? Now you have to look for that and realize &ldquo;There but for the love of God go I but what am I doing? Am I just sitting back? I know that person will work out his karma, good, but am I giving the necessary vibrations that would ease the tensions in his unfoldment?&rdquo; So when we say we&rsquo;re healing now, I&rsquo;m not healing one individual no more, I&rsquo;m healing the entire creation back, that each one unfold out because I&rsquo;m healing myself &ldquo;physician heal yourself,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re healing back yourself from your higher self, you&rsquo;re healing this force. So you have to vibrate now and think of the elemental kingdom, seeing them in a state of light and peace, you have to see the entire mineral kingdom which we took all our substances from and vibrate it back, we have to send the same thing to the vegetable kingdom, we have to send the same thing to the animal kingdom, the human kingdom, and we have to send it to the spiritual kingdom, and the cosmic principle in ourselves. Now we realize that we are moving to a certain destiny, don&rsquo;t tell me that 20 years or 100 years ago if someone was sitting down in this room and we were all praying, we would still have candles here, and the year 1965 if we kept on 100 years praying, we&rsquo;ll still have the candles here, you see? That doesn&rsquo;t say you haven&rsquo;t evolved spiritually by your prayers, you haven&rsquo;t evolved with attitude, but you haven&rsquo;t evolved materially because you are one-sided. Now none of these Masters will admit that is a valid truth, a truth is we are threefold in nature like a three-legged stool, no leg is more important than the other, each is equally important at the same moment in time, your physical environment, your physical well-being, your mental environment, your mental well-being, your spiritual environment and spiritual well-being, but they don&rsquo;t work independently, they must work collectively, so we say it&rsquo;s a three-fold development. 1:40 Now only by techniques do one see the connecting link and can apply it and this is actually pointing up the four steps to Divinity, conscious sleep, conscious death, conscious resurrection, and conscious ascension, and every religion of any value has these principles established in it in different words but the actual result as a principle in nature, you begin to see for the first time scientifically. The scientist is no far off from the mystic, they are crossing each other depending on swinging. The scientist is coming by the senses via to the invisible realm, the mystic is coming from the independence of the senses back to the physical realm, they want to cross, they have to cross each other. Now when they cross each other, they recognize that this is exactly what&rsquo;s happening, so we have what is called a new rebirth, a rebith of world consciousness. Thank you. Any questions? I know there&rsquo;s going to be lots of questions back. (Gap in tape.) Audience: &hellip; you mentioned freedom from hate and freedom from ignorance but if you mention (inaudible)&hellip; Adano: Freedom from fear gives you courage, now freedom from hate gives you love, freedom from ignorance gives you enlightenment, and freedom from self-interest gives you cosmic nature or cosmic consciousness. Audience: What do you mean by self-interest? Adano: Any action that you center around your own immediate needs to the exclusion of others is self-interest. You see, the moment you include others, you have begun to exert your cosmic nature&hellip; Audience: &hellip; and you&rsquo;re no longer unique. Adano: Right, it is a form of selfishness you see, but remember&hellip; Audience: I think you&rsquo;re still unique, you&rsquo;re not unique if you&rsquo;re not selfish? Adano: Yes you&rsquo;re unique this way, capital SELF but not little &ldquo;self&rdquo; &hellip; Audience: You&rsquo;re unique in that God has a purpose for you. Adano: Right, the cosmic self is unique you see, but we&rsquo;ll find this written selfish or big &ldquo;S.&rdquo; We must remember that normally we trigger off self-interest for our immediate self but it&rsquo;s not for the highest self&hellip; Audience: Self preservation&hellip; Adano: Right, the higher self is interested in the whole. Audience: You mentioned it as your fourth phase self-actualization or actualization? Adano: No, ascension. Audience: I interpreted this as being an actualization. Adano: No, no, no, actualization you are identified with the thing actually and therefore possess the ability to materialize your thoughts at will or bring your thoughts into manifestation at will, that is a self-actualization function, but this has not to do with ascension. The ascension is that these forces ascend within you by your consciousness to adjust to any condition you find yourself in, this is what we&rsquo;re trying to establish. Audience: Well many people in a group like this are actually displaced Christians or rebels or something like that, they&rsquo;re looking for something else and perhaps they found it, this is all very well, but how about somewhere along this process, many of us who have been rebels against everything, discipline, self-discipline, externally impose discipline, and so forth, finally come to the realization that the only way to be free is to go along with what is required of us. Adano: Well then you then you are defeating your spiritual nature, you are defeating your spiritual nature. Audience: By doing what is required, we are defeating our spiritual nature? Adano: Yes. Audience: I&rsquo;d like you going into that a little bit. Adano: You see there&rsquo;s an old saying, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t beat them, join them,&rdquo; but this is not true in as far as the Masters are concerned, this will be true because it&rsquo;s the next stop gap in evolution for that individual or as a group, to do that. Just like the word use, abuse, abstinence, self-control&hellip; Audience: ethics and morality. Adano: Right, so the first thing you use a thing and then you abuse the thing and because you abuse it and you&rsquo;re hurt, then you don&rsquo;t try to control, you learn to abstain, there&rsquo;s where the Masters say &ldquo;nature has forsaken you,&rdquo; just like you say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t beat them, I&rsquo;ll join them.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not true, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; if you are in any sense a realized individual you see that this is only a stop gap for a lack of spiritual adventure-ness or spiritual investigation. Audience: Do you include in that category ethics and morality as merely a stock gap? Adano: It is a stop gap, don&rsquo;t quote me as a stop gap as sometime invalid to living, it is necessary for living until we understand the cosmic principle, then we will see there is a valid ethic and there is a valid moral, but there are valid ones and there are many invalid ones that we impose upon ourselves. Audience: I don&rsquo;t disagree with you, I just want to know. Adano: You see there is a valid truth, we must realize there is valid truth, and there is invalid truth that passes for truth. Now we must able to separate the invalid truth from the real truth. Audience: What&rsquo;s your formula for doing that? This is an important problem in everyday living, how do you go about doing that, separating the valid from the invalid when it comes to ethics and morals? What&rsquo;s expected of us and what we expect of ourselves, sometimes is true and sometimes is not, but how do we know which one to follow? Adano: That is where meditation comes in. Audience: Oh I know that and you know it too but how do you put it to the group? Adano: The group as I said, if they understand what meditation represented, they would apply it now. For the first time in their lives they would mentally direct the energy from their individual id action to an intuitive perception as where they should be and what they should be doing, so this would free them from the frustration in that. Audience: It doesn&rsquo;t resolve itself into a matter of compassion? Does it hurt other people or does it benefit them? Adano: Well let me put it this way, if I pick up on you all the time to correct you, would you say I hate you? Audience: No, you might be trying to help me. Adano: All right, so greater love is the man who spanked you the most and that&rsquo;s why the Guru, the day He stopped picking up on me, that&rsquo;s the day I will cry. I laugh every time He picks upon me or give me a test in some way, you see. If there&rsquo;s no one to pick upon me in some form, I&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;ve reached the end of my development and this will swell my head, I don&rsquo;t want that to happen. Audience: Or you are so worthless, He&rsquo;s not going to try anymore. Audience: That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m picking on you. Adano: Good. Audience: I think that there&rsquo;s actually no simple formula whereby you may know right from wrong in every situation or the right door to open and the right one to close in every moment of the day except through meditation. Adano: Right, meditation gives you the unerring choice and remember this, what some people consider a mistake, I have found in the mystic life was a success for me at that particular instant. They said it was a mistake, it turned around I showed them it was selfish for them also. Most mistakes turn out, why? Because in the mystic life timing is the essence of success. Audience: Will you tell me how (inaudible) you were you talking about sleep, when you have a great deal on your mind, how would you correct that to be able to turn in off. I&rsquo;ll go to sleep and wake up all of a sudden, I have this and this to do in my mind, how would you do that? Adano: Well I&rsquo;ll show you. This is the brain, this is the base, it&rsquo;s the storage tank you know, you put the gas inside like a tank (inaudible). Now what do you do to your car when you want to start it, you switch it right? And you shift the gears and you drive out. In this mechanism we have energy that&rsquo;s doing the same thing, but we have natural principles to shift. You have an impending pressure and as I say I have found the bathroom or the washroom is an ideal refresher course room, you take 10 minutes to go in there, if you have to avoid the group, &ldquo;gentlemen excuse me,&rdquo; just to go in there and you put your hand. 1:50 This is a star, five-pointed star, here is ether, this is fire, this is air, this is water, this is earth, you&rsquo;re hooked into magic (mage-ic?), the mother force, just like a plug you see, a socket, and you concentrate feeling a golden blue white light surrounding the entire body, until you start to feel it coming in, &ldquo;and as many as receive to them gave ye the power to become Sons of God,&rdquo; as many individuals who are conscious of the vital energies passing through the mechanism, that is receiving, &ldquo;to them&rdquo; or to that individual suspension is possible now, you have a self-healing principle going on with you, begin to feel it. Now you feel like the head here is suspended, now it will feel like a tranquilizer, you will walk with this suspension and your mind would function sharply and come back again, and the strangest thing, you would regroup your forces and you would start to play it by ear, every little indication would lead you to the thing you want to decide on. So sometimes I&rsquo;ve noticed even with disciples that I&rsquo;ve met who live all the time with the Master, He decided to do something and it was not until a year after did he complete do it, He kept postponing it, they kept going after him to do the thing and they said, &ldquo;Master this is on our mind.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Alight, patience, patience.&rdquo; He was also allowing time in the process and don&rsquo;t you see in your courts or any problems today you&rsquo;re always asking for more time to regroup your forces. That time principle is vital to correcting, that time principle suspends, He said &ldquo;time is the healer&rdquo; but it suspends, but when you feel this consciousness and light coming in, it acts like a band, you can feel like somebody put an invisible cap on your head and it suspends for a time and you vibrate from there. Now the more cautious and I say that is watching your words with the problem whoever you&rsquo;re involved with, you vibrate and you wait for the clues from them to act upon it, and this is what you call conscious meditation, conscious vibration, you are working. Audience: Yeah I know but I have done that and I go sound asleep for about 15 minutes I&rsquo;m wide awake again. Adano: No you see if you practice, that&rsquo;s where meditation comes in, now I&rsquo;ll show you something, what is vitally important to help it, sound waves are vitally important. By playing music it starts to correct but don&rsquo;t listen to the sound waves, see you don&rsquo;t want to listen to the sound waves, you don&rsquo;t want to hear the music, you want to feel it, why? The sound waves bouncing on the mechanism as you try to feel these frequencies for the first time and it taxes you to feel because you&rsquo;ll see how weak your feeling really is, how weak your sensitivity really is, to feel an electrical frequency bouncing across your body and that thing is traveling at the speed of light and it&rsquo;s bouncing against you and if you can feel it, it feels like a hot cold sensation just passing and it will correct certain pressures in there and allow you to relax. Now also if you find that you&rsquo;re too overtense in that state, lie flat on the ground and feel the energy coming in from the feet right up the hip and this is orienting the whole mechanism back because you start to sort of lubricate. You see there may be certain pressures that the bed spring or the mattress is interfering with allowing you to relax. Now if you sleep flat on the floor for the first time it&rsquo;s going to be a torture if you&rsquo;ve never slept on the floor. Audience: In fact your back is far better off if you sleep on something hard. Adano: All right good. Now if you&rsquo;ve ever experienced it you&rsquo;ll find then because of the tremendous evenness of the floor, sooner or later your body works out the tension. Remember to rid yourself of tension, you got to be more tense, that&rsquo;s a simple law, I&rsquo;ll show. You here&rsquo;s my hand and I&rsquo;m tense, I want to get rid of the tension, now tension is a constriction. Audience: Well doesn&rsquo;t that come from the mind? Adano: Everything comes from the mind but it&rsquo;s interlinked so if you say everything is only mind it&rsquo;s not right. We must realize there are two things that actually exist, energy, which looks at matter and mind which is the field in which energy existed. Now the two are triggered off by volition, which is the craving to modify and the craving to stabilize and to do that you have to exert a craving with a certain pressure, so if you are tense and you feel your head is tense, to relax that tension is to tense further by a natural principle it flips back. Now sometimes my head is tense from working and so what do I do? So the mere principle of reflex action or Pavlov&rsquo;s law of reflex action which he called his law which is nature&rsquo;s law, the further you go out, the harder you come back the opposite direction. The whole body relaxes, you feel the whole energy shift away and the head is&hellip; Now there&rsquo;s another way, if it&rsquo;s very tense and you can&rsquo;t shut down, then since the energy is vibrating at the back of the neck and since you know where the energy is entering here, you shift it now by concentration again this way, it pulls it out. Audience: You mentioned the word volition and quite frequently people that have these problems have them because they say, &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; chronic defeatism and doing anything is better than doing nothing isn&rsquo;t it? Adano: Yes, you must do something that is true, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m giving you a tangible thing to do. Why you realize I said that you must do something tangible to connect, see if you don&rsquo;t do something tangible to connect then depending strictly on concentration is not moving it. See mind alone is not enough, this principle is mind and energy, so when the two are working together you have a result. Audience: By mind and energy that is what you mean by volition, a combination of mind and energy? Adano: Right. Audience: I&rsquo;ll agree with you on that. Adano: You must exert. Now I&rsquo;ll show you an illustration of mine. I want, I want, a lesson from the mind, I crave to bend this finger, I crave or desire to bend the finger, I&rsquo;m craving it, and therefore it&rsquo;s in my mind, I crave it bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend bend. It&rsquo;s not going to go until I exert the energy. Now if you are sensitive you will feel what? The connection, now the greater the desire, the greater the energy, now see how this thing is? There&rsquo;s a certain amount of energy required just the finger, there&rsquo;ll be a certain amount of energy, yet the desire is hooked together, they&rsquo;re united. The greater the desire, the greater the energy but we take these things for granted because I lift the chair up you, you don&rsquo;t know how much energy, how much desire you release, I lift this up, you don&rsquo;t know how much energy, I lift this up, we don&rsquo;t know how much energy but once you begin to realize that these are principles all the time, here you find out what is called the efficiency of motion. Audience: Yeah I&rsquo;ve experienced that, last time I had a broken wrist and you tried it that you you want to have the efficiency of motion and yet you can&rsquo;t have it. Adano: Right because you don&rsquo;t know how to conserve. Audience: It hurts too much! Adano: All right but if it hurts, you seek to conserve when it hurts, but by gradually lifting. Adano: I guess but you can&rsquo;t do it overnight. Adano: When you say overnight that is partially true but not completely true. If you know how to trigger energy from the medulla to the arm, you can do it, if you don&rsquo;t know it will take longer. 2:00 Now it makes no difference if it takes longer or shorter, let us take what is considered a norm. If the norm for this arm to return back to normal is 21 days without exerting any effort for it to return to the norm versus a little self-effort or volition to return to the norm in 14 days, isn&rsquo;t there seven days saving. Audience: Yes I understand what you mean but when you have a broken bone, no matter how hard I tried I still couldn&rsquo;t do it. Audience: Well maybe you didn&rsquo;t have enough volition and push. Audience: It has to heal, how can I heal it overnight? Adano: The arm is broken but you don&rsquo;t heal it overnight, wait a minute, you want to say Adano maybe talking through his hat, he may not have the experience but I&rsquo;m talking from 54 compound fractures based upon applied principles of consciousness on bone and muscle, I&rsquo;m talking to you from that experience. All right, the norm from my studies in anatomy and physiology tells me these things correct themselves in a given time, I have two choices, that is I have a choice of coaxing it along or I have the choice to generate enough willpower to instantaneously knit the bones together. Now he tells me if you do that, right away you become a freak in this society and you&rsquo;re gonna live with the ramifications of being such a freak, what do you prefer to do? I says, &ldquo;well I&rsquo;ll go according a little coaxing it.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you something, I broke the body and I had a vision on the fourth day you see, I came out of shock, the accident occurred on Wednesday night, I came out of the shock Saturday afternoon, the Sunday the doctor told me coming out of this condition will create pain and for a whole week because the bones are all broken, these 54 are cut and broken apart, and that we&rsquo;d have to give you hypodermic around the clock every hour to keep you in this state till the thing works itself out. You know what I said to the doctor, from my studies of metaphysics I said &ldquo;doctor I don&rsquo;t want no drugs in my body.&rdquo; So he look at me and says, &ldquo;you Orientals are all alike, you think you know more than us.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not it doctor, I just don&rsquo;t want drugs in the body.&rdquo; Alright, not that I didn&rsquo;t want drugs if there was gangrine or something, the fact that it was for pain, the lessening of pain, I didn&rsquo;t want it to sedate the pain that I lived with it to work out. So I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight the pain.&rdquo; Now normally we all think we have tremendous metaphysical powers awakened in us because we seem to have read a great deal, but what we read and what we develop is two different things, and whatever contact we have with some other higher being, that&rsquo;s a different thing altogether, until we know where we are, we can do these things, we got to realize we&rsquo;re in different levels. At my level where I was at the time, I was trying to fight with what I knew from the body principle backed up with my concentration. Okay what happened? I realized that the body started to ache so I said I&rsquo;ll fight it, well I bit off more than I chew eventually because I realize that, so I try to fight the pain and like the old cowboys used to do, put something in your mouth and then they&rsquo;ll dig a bullet out of your leg. So I bit on the pillow and I&rsquo;m fighting the pain and it&rsquo;s aching and I&rsquo;m perspiring&hellip; (Gap in tape.) Audience: Adano Ley is with the Self Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles and he goes around the country speaking and helping everybody. He spends part of the time in Houston I believe, that&rsquo;s where we find him most of the time but we&rsquo;re never sure where he is, he comes to see us every now and then. I&rsquo;m very glad to have you all here. Adano: Thank you Paul, good evening everyone. I guess you&rsquo;ll see so many photographs and some you may be acquainted with, some you&rsquo;re not acquainted with, I&rsquo;ll just clarify who they are and what they represent. This is the Param Guru Paramahansa Yogananda and we all know this, He&rsquo;s been with us for over 1900 years, His name is Jesus. This is the teacher of my own Guru Sri Yukteswar and this is Lahiri Mahasaya, the disciple of the Mahavatar Babaji. Those who are acquainted with occult knowledge or metaphysical studies know what Avatar is, but when we use the word Mahavatar, we&rsquo;re talking of the Lord of the Planet. Jesus is not the Lord of the Planet, He came to this planet, lived on it, demonstrated the science of Kriya Yoga and ascended out of the planet, that&rsquo;s why he had to pass through what is called death in the western term, in the East it is called Mahasamadhi and from that you go to Resurrection and from Resurrection you go through the great initiation of Ascension. Now every 40 days after Easter you have a day they call Ascension in Christian rituals, but not knowing what it represents we cannot practice these sciences, but these are the five Masters of Self-Realization. Now Self-Realization is not an organization, it so happened the name was chosen for the West by these Masters. Babaji initiated His disciple of the 19th century Lahiri to give the world the Kriya science once again that was lost after the death of Timothy. See Timothy, a disciple of Jesus, the science was no longer practiced because it became organized religion throughout the centuries in Christianity, but in the West that is what has happened. In the East a few dedicated Kriya students or disciples or initiates have maintained that link with these Masters in the monasteries. Babaji initiated Him and just called the cosmic science Kriya for short, Kriya means scientific union, you&rsquo;ll find the word Kriya in many other branches of Yoga meaning a cleansing technique, has nothing to do with the cosmic science of the Master Babaji because kriya science is the Book of Revelation in your Christian bible. Now this is a disciple Sri Yukteswar of this Master Lahiri and one day He felt great love for Western people and He attended what is called a religious fair, you know you go to a fair, a trade fair, well a Kumbla Mela is a religious fair or today we have what is called a Parliament of Religions, groupings of people that gather to give out their concepts on the religious views of life. While attending one of these fairs He noticed someone tapping Him on the shoulder telling Him a Master wants to speak to Him. So He went to see the Master and He saw this young boy, He looks like a man of 21 to 23 years of age, that is the agelessness of the body. Now He did not know the full age of the Master but nevertheless the Master called Him Swami. Now a Swami is a very revered title when placed upon a person because it entails not only renunciation, which most people take the title for, but it entails knowledge of the swah, that is self. When He called Him Swami He said, &ldquo;I am not, I&rsquo;m just an ordinary householder.&rdquo; So the Master said, &ldquo;who I give this title, do not normally shirk it.&rdquo; So He accepted the title and He made a remark that people in the West would profit more from the gathering of these Masters than the people that were sitting there doing nothing. So the great Master said to him, &ldquo;I see you have love or compassion for your fellow man, someday in the future I will send you a disciple that you will train for the West in order to spread the cosmic science Kriya.&rdquo; Now that disciple happened to be this person, Yogananda. He met His Guru and He lived with his Guru for approximately 10 to 11 years, within that time obtaining the Cosmic Consciousness and one day had a vision of coming to the West. 2:10 Well He was trained all through His life for western dissemination of the science. When He was ready to leave the Mahavatar manifested Himself into His room and told them, &ldquo;You are the one I have chosen to disseminate the cosmic science in the West.&rdquo; Well He was so pleased to know that and many things transmit between a Master and a disciple that cannot be told except by telepathy and initiation. So He came to America in 1920 just at the period when most people in the West were in conflict with all the new thoughts, the new metaphysical schools that are popping up, the different interpretations of the Bible, the different psychological versions that exist, only to do one thing and that is to establish long-lost science of Kriya which we know is in the Book of Revelations in the english Bible. Now the same science of Kriya the Sikh religion follow, the same science the Muslims follow, it&rsquo;s named in a different name, it&rsquo;s practiced with a different terminology but it&rsquo;s the same one basic science. English or the westerner practice it but does not even know it, he reads about it and he says it&rsquo;s a book called Revelation and very few people understand the Book of Revelation, yet the cosmic Master Jesus demonstrated Kriya while alive all the time. Tonight we will show the underlying unity in this cosmic science being manifested from East to West and now made possible for the householder today in all nations that he can practice the cosmic science. One of the first statements that the Master Jesus made in the Science of Kirya, He said, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single&rdquo; and the word left out was visioned or focused, &ldquo;the body is full of light.&rdquo; Now this has had many psychological interpretations, many philosophical interpretations, but as far as Jesus was concerned as far as these Masters were concerned, had nothing to do with the cosmic science, it&rsquo;s totally unrelated to it. They knew what They were talking about, we don&rsquo;t know, they were talking of the cosmic light, we call that God, responsible for all of us here. For lack of a better name we use God you see but light, without it everyone in here will be the same nationality or color and as far as sex is concerned you would not even know your neighbor if the room is black. So this is one little illustration of what the light is, but They are talking of atomic light, which is cosmic energy. When the two optical nerves of the eyes are focused like lenses of a camera through the aid of light, the photosynthesis and the negative function of the eye act as a plate, photograph the light, and leave what is called an optical image relationship in the brain thus making you conscious of your fellow man around you as what he is, then you see the ancient people say or these scientists say, you live in Maya, you live in an optical illusion world. He been born among the Hebrew people could not use the word Maya because it would not mean anything to Hebrew people, therefore used what was most common in Hebrew word sat-an, the natural adversary of nature, the polarity. Greeks for love of personality took the word and made it into an individual, Satan, some individual with a pitchfork, long tail, sitting on a bag of fire or something trying to stoke the fires of hell with human souls you see, that is the concept that has ended up in mythology. The cosmic science is coming out of it gradually, Eastern people have used the word Maya but today Maya, sat-an, only mean one thing as far as objective consciousness is concerned or cosmic consciousness is concerned, it means relativity, the polarities of light in which we live, without it nothing is here. We could not comprehend it in the past 2000 years because of our physical evolution, today with the advent of atomic discovery and the release of its forces, we can now comprehend what these cosmic scientists were talking about. Now They were revered, They had to be revered, and will be revered because reverence is a function that goes on in us to understand what they represent, They wanted Man to realize himself and not be a victim of the senses. Now if a person would focus the eyes, the point between the eyebrows, and if he would apply a little pressure on the eyeball so the balls don&rsquo;t move, he would see light and the different refractions of light breaking up in colors, try it. (Short meditation). Okay, are you convinced? Audience: No I don&rsquo;t see anything else. Adano: You couldn&rsquo;t see black, you saw color and what is color? A breaking up of the white light and the pineal gland, the pituitary gland, is composed of crystals that act as refractors of light, we have it in the outside world, you have it in the same here. We are 16 basic chemical elements plus a few trace elements plus an entire electrical anatomy plus an ideational anatomy. Audience: What are the glands you are talking about? You said the glands. Adano: The pituitary and the pineal, these glands contain certain crystals in them and by the concentrated pressure or stresses we caused this light to come out. Now in your Eastern knowledge this has been known to be Star of the East because this is East in Man and this is West in Man, and this is North, and this is South because Man is a miniature macrocosm. The ancient Sages knew that this was a self-contained universe all in itself. Now in the West they say the light that you just squeezed, &ldquo;the light shines in the darkness and darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a statement which means the same thing, it&rsquo;s in here by the way of pressure you see the light, but there&rsquo;s nothing there to be afraid of, in fact the more you are involved with the light, the more you discover your true nature and this light, if we understand that the light from the sun travels 186,000 miles a second, imagine how fast you who are composite of this light, you cannot relate this speed to yourself, what is happening inside of you. Occasionally you get a blow on the head and you see stars or you see some flash of light and that is a normal terminology or the idiom we use, &ldquo;I saw light,&rdquo; light what? Light to who and light to where, light to when, light to how. 2:20 Don&rsquo;t mean anything as far as a realized person is concerned but seeing light and knowing that He is light in the form&hellip; Yes? Audience: You said in the West and the light is light (inaudible). Adano: I said in the West they use the term, &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness and darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; when they use that term. In the East, we use the same thing &ldquo;light of the East,&rdquo; &ldquo;light of Asia,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re saying the same thing, so understand what we&rsquo;re inferring then we know what we&rsquo;re doing with this force. Kriya is only a term applied to this science, it&rsquo;s not really the name of it because for lack of a better word the Master Avatar just named the whole science Kriya which means scientific union with the light. That means you have to apply some scientific process to unite yourself with the light but until you understand this mechanism and how it functions, you cannot apply a scientific method, it would be a hit and miss, it would be out of control, and it would be a guesswork, but these Masters have spent entire life patterns to emphasize this science and put it down. We&rsquo;re showing the underlying unity between the East and the West being the same science and two distinct words they&rsquo;ll be using meaning the same thing when you start to understand what you&rsquo;re doing. In Jesus He&rsquo;s telling you a simple technique in a simple statement, a simple and profound fact, that you are a manifestation of light. Now no one here who knows any science cannot say he&rsquo;s not a manifestation of atomic energy and when we&rsquo;re using a word only in relation, we can say you&rsquo;re spirit. All right it&rsquo;s a good Greek word, it comes from the Greek language spiros, to spin, but what spins? Force, life force, pran, this is in a state of motion all the time, it&rsquo;s never going to stop, so these are terms, these are the semantics they&rsquo;ve been using for centuries to illustrate to ourselves what we are. We&rsquo;re trying to establish how it is possible that these men awaken this force in themselves and how this force makes certain alterations in the mechanism and what this force offers in this mechanism. One of the first experiences in this whole principle of looking in the light, you begin to hear sound also. Now this sound is the actual motion created by the very atomic structure, now in certain religions it has been referred to as the Word, the Name, the Holy Current, Music of the Spheres. We know today beyond doubt that when you hook in to that particular electronic frequency, you are in tune with the motion of the atoms in nature all the time, it&rsquo;s always there. Now if you can calm the mind to hook in, you can hear it, now we see symbols in the East with a conch, now if you pick up a conch and you put it over your ear you&rsquo;re going to hear a whirring sound, just like if you&rsquo;re near the ocean. For centuries Man has been doing it in a sense without knowing why, when it&rsquo;s told to him why, it frees him from from using a ritual and put him in position to use his consciousness. When he begins to use his consciousness now he can merge in the thing and hear it. Well that particular frequency has many sounds, it&rsquo;s like a large rope with many strands, the same way that this particular frequency has many sounds in it. Now each sound has a focal point on this final mechanism, in your Book of Revelations it has also been mentioned as such, in the English Bible they&rsquo;ve called it a trumpet. Now in Eastern countries they don&rsquo;t call it a trumpet, they call it a flute, Krishna&rsquo;s flute, but you do hear if you take a flute and blow it that particular musical note is a particular frequency, if you play the trumpet and get the sound alliance you have the same relationship. Yes? Audience: What we are talking about are you saying that the actual reactions of a human being are controlled by those cosmic rays or by God or whatever we can say, now flute or trumpet, three people there, are three of them hearing the same thing? How they do it? And three of them react differently in the same given situation. I mean what are we referring to when we say the sound of the trumpet that sounds like a flute? What really does that mean? I can&rsquo;t comprehend. Adano: (Laughing) I said in the West if you hear this particular sound it breaks up into many other sounds, one of the sounds is like a trumpet. In the East that particular sound would be like a flute. It has nothing to do with how you react. Audience: No the sound to who? Adano: The sound of nature passing through each one of us here at a particular frequency, all right your heart has a certain beat, the next person heart has a certain beat, now if we record it we will see from a given measurement it stays within a certain pattern. Now this is a known fact that there are certain sounds passing through the mechanism that stay within a given pattern, we are using a frame of reference that in Western writings that particular pattern would be referred to as the trumpet, if you have read the Christian scripture that particular part is referred to as a trumpet. In the east it&rsquo;s referred as a flute, being the frame of reference with two people in two different areas, referring to that pattern of that sound but this has nothing to do with how you react or how I react, this is a movement, you understand now? As I said I&rsquo;ll show you the unity of the thing where the two things connect as a science. Well there are other sounds, I said if you pick up a conch and in Oriental art you&rsquo;ll see sometimes a conch in the hand of one of the figurines and one would say, &ldquo;what does it represent?&rdquo; All right if you take a conch and hold it over the ear, it&rsquo;ll sound like the roar of an ocean. In the western writings or your Bible, the Western Bible, such a symbol was referred to as rushing waters, the similarity of the two parts of the globe experiencing this particular function gave a similarity in words. If we establish what this similarity is then we have something tangible to work from, otherwise we have nothing to work from, we will be fighting with the conch and we will be fighting with the rushing waters but if we establish what on the line is responsible, then we have something to work from. So your prophets in the Western scriptures said that they heard like a rushing waters, they heard within themselves like rushing waters, this higher sound. In other writings it is referred to as a conch, so in one writing it&rsquo;s being referred to as the oozing out of oil from a drum. These are the ways that particular frequency have been referred to, the terminologies used to refer to it, what we&rsquo;re trying to establish is that if these sounds in their true nature do exist and they are universal, it makes no difference how you relate it in a word or how you come in contact with it, it exists, and if it does exist there is a reason for it to exist. If there is a reason for it to exist, we must know how to tap it or use it. 2:30 Now various techniques have been devised both for Eastern people, both for Western people, there have been various techniques for it, but if the techniques show an underlying unity then we see there is a slow process of illumination without the purity of the thing, we will see a science emerging from it. Let&rsquo;s take one more aspect of the science, in the Western Bible it says the body is the temple of the living God, this is a terminology they used to represent something. In the East it has also been known that this is a manifestation of the Cosmic Mind. Now if we see an underlying point of reference, we see that there is a reverence between the two, if you have a reverence for this body as a Westerner, you would have a reverence for this body as the Easterner, no matter what the terminology you call it, there is the underlying reverence for it, both sides of the fence. Now if reverence is an underlying attitude, then this is something that is tangible to work with. Now we&rsquo;re trying to point out that if the body is the temple from this framework, we must understand a temple, like most temples, would have an altar. Now a temple is an oriental word in the first place, in the East it&rsquo;s called temple, in the Hebrew people it&rsquo;s called synagogue, in the western churches it&rsquo;s called Church, but Church, Temple, Synagogue, House of Worship, House of Reverence, they all have a sacred spot which you call altar. Now if the human body has been referred to as such by Eastern scientists or by Western scientists of the Soul, then we see there is an underlying unity to this, an underlying reference point, this underlying reference point is the human spine. Now in the East we have many Sages who walk with a human spine, a dried out spine, as a staff, here in the West we have some object that is long, we have like a table, and we have a reference, some referring point to that. Now in the Book of Revelations which is written for the West mind, it said that in this altar of God there were seven golden candlesticks. Now throughout ages Man has always placed a candle at the altar as a place of reference, light, which was a symbol for Him, and in the East they were always burning candles at the holy spot to maintain the light. Now we see if we can establish this relationship, we&rsquo;re seeing something now. There were seven mentioned, a particular number, in the East it&rsquo;s also mentioned there are seven particular functions in the human mechanism which they refer to as centers or chakras. In the West it has been called several golden candlesticks, as far as the cosmic scientists were concerned it meant seven centers of consciousness in the human mechanism where the life energy and consciousness beamed in in a human being. These symbols are all referring to one thing, eventually it&rsquo;s emerging into one thing. Now they said these candlesticks and there were seven candles or lights, so a candlestick is a holder and the candle is inside with the light, so if you have a focal point, you must have some force coming out of it, a force field coming out of it. So if you have the same thing as a chakra which is a center, you&rsquo;ll have a degree of consciousness or force coming out of it. We see the same relationship, they&rsquo;re not talking of two different things identically but terminologies are a little different, reference is still the same, they are still looking at a reference point and a reference point of reverence you see. Now in the Western scriptures it said that these candlesticks were centered around the throne of God, that was a frame of reference they used, all right a throne is supposed to be a seat of royalty and if it was centered around it, we have a spine and the most unique part of the body is still the brain, the brain, the head. So in the East we know that the chakras were centered around Brahm, the same thing was mentioned in the Eastern writings and we find the same thing appearing in Western writing, they call it in the West a throne of God, in the East it was called the Brahm, the center of the Great Spirit, God, another name, but we&rsquo;re seeing an underlying relationship. If you see an underlying relationship, we can see now something to work with, it is a common unity, there is a common bond, a common existing. Now in the West this throne of God was referred to as a golden light with wooly and wool is white and gold is gold and it was gold and wooly light. Now in the East it is known that in the cosmic brain of Man or this consciousness of Man, this light would be gold, white, and blue, they had three established colors already for it. In the West these colors were already being described as wool which is white, as gold throne, and as blue as the sky. So when you realize that what we are saying now, as a science we are saying as a science in every human being male, female, East, or West, any nationality now, there is a focal point in this mechanism, there are seven focal points in it that you draw from a central source and this central source emits light and the colors from light are of three basic important ones, there are more but these are the three important ones. Now the Sages said that these colors had some relationships and these sound relationships were important because it gave you control of nature. If we can ally ourselves or unite ourselves with the sound and move with it, hence we got the word mantra, sound alliance, in the Western part of the world we have affirmation, sound alliance, too. You see there is no difference between the two parts of the world using the same frame of reference but different terminology for the thing. So if the man in the East uses his mantra to generate sound alliance by his mind, the man in the West can use his affirmation to generate the same sound alliance by the mind. Now if you take a mantra and a mantra when broken down to mean &ldquo;I am He,&rdquo; that is an affirmation in itself because you are affirming a fact, in English that is what you will be doing to yourself. Now in the East if a man says Sanskrit, uses a Sanskrit phrase for that particular affirmation as a sound alliance, he would slowly cause his mind to accelerate, he would do it loud, audible, he would do it slowly, within a whisper, he&rsquo;ll do it mentally and eventually he will just think of that phrase and lose himself and become one with it, in the West we do exactly the same thing. So we have now an alliance, we have a unity, we have a common frame to work with, we see now that this is universal, this particular function is universal, this is a science in itself. Now this science is scientific hence the word Kriya, scientific union, because you&rsquo;re uniting yourself with the thing no matter if you&rsquo;re Eastern or Western, you are uniting, you are putting yourself in unity. So East or West makes no difference, the point is you as an individual unite scientifically, consciously, momentarily every instant, there is no separation now, it&rsquo;s all now. When we understand that then we can understand what these men are trying to point out to us in order for us to awaken it. They said now if this force is in us then we need to know how to quicken it. 2:40 Now the Kriya yoga measured by the Sage Babaji has a specific technique to quicken the human evolution into Cosmic Consciousness. Now none of us know what Cosmic Consciousness until you merge into it and when you merge into it you experience many symptoms. One of the basic symptoms of Cosmic Consciousness is conscious sensory motor organic relaxation, that is the five senses shut off, the motor functions shut off, the heart and lungs shut off, and this particular condition has a name in the Orient too, it&rsquo;s called Samadhi but the functions are still there regardless if it happens in the Eastern man, it happens in the Western man. We will still see that he&rsquo;s not going to have his five senses working, we&rsquo;re still going to see that he&rsquo;s not breathing, his heart is not beating, so this is a common function. Now this is not something to be scared of because this is something that happens to us occasionally at times you see but we cannot just merge into it right away, we have to work towards it, so we work towards it by the practice of meditation. Now in meditation the same symptoms are going to be present but in a different way, in the body we will see the five senses they shut down, the motor functions shut down, but the heart and lungs don&rsquo;t shut down. Now if this happens to an Eastern Man or a Western Man it&rsquo;s the same thing because if a man he sits in a cave to meditate or a house to meditate or a Western man sits here to meditate, in the meditational practice he&rsquo;s going to experience identical the same symptoms. Now as far as the unfolding, each one unfolds differently, that is the capacity of perception and the receptivity of each individual is different. What we&rsquo;re establishing are the common facts about the thing so we have something tangible to work with and there is no fear because one of the basic things in any research into ourselves is the normal fears, the normal fears of tampering, the normal fears of being guilty of, the normal fears of shame, the normal fears of ostracism, these are things we build up in ourselves, but if you see a underlying principle then there is nothing to be afraid of because it is a natural thing and if you don&rsquo;t do it, Eastern or Western, sooner or later nature will push you by another method called disease. Very unique mother you know she is, you don&rsquo;t want to learn truth, make you sick, you&rsquo;ll learn it sooner or later, you gonna evolve. So she has a way to make you evolve by pain you see, pain and suffering, but we can evolve without pain and suffering by culture, by attitude, by organized living, by self-control, this particular process is much wholesome than by pain, because pain if you&rsquo;re in pain you can&rsquo;t meditate too good. I don&rsquo;t know of any Saint that can meditate with a toothache unless He has transcend that and even when he transcend that He knows that when He comes down from the meditation, it&rsquo;s still going to be there but as you advance you can change the toothache too, these are all qualities that you do and those who have lived in any meditative practice can see that you can do these things but we&rsquo;re establishing the common platform for the science. Kriya, now we say that it is a science that quickens the human evolution, how can this be true? On what grounds have we got to verify that this is true, it does quicken human evolution? Only by the way it is constructed and the way it is related to us we can verify that. To evolve means that we have to live on a planet called Earth that must rotate around the Sun and the Sun with its planets must rotate in a zodiac around another star or sun and keep on going ad infinitum and every seven or eight years we have a change in cellular structure. So this is an evolving process, they have an evolving of the brain receptivity. Now we say every seven years scientist shows that the brain jumps a little more or extends itself a little more, the Sages say &ldquo;no it&rsquo;s eight not seven&rdquo; and They show why it&rsquo;s eight. There&rsquo;s a building in California and it&rsquo;s a planetarium and we have a pendulum and they push it once every eight years but it comes to a stop exactly at the end of the eighth year, it will keep moving back and forth but it will come to stop for a moment in time and then you have to push it again for every eight years, there&rsquo;s a reason for that and the Sages are right. Until we understand what the Sages are saying then we would not know what they&rsquo;re talking about because we have six months of change to the resistances, the natural resistances in the body or the natural resistances to motion, and six months after the natural adjustments to the motion. So we go six months in resistance, then we go seven years of a momentum, then we take six months to break it. Now we see the same thing in space, we shoot a satellite and if we want to change and alter its position, you know if you want to go higher you got to go slower and you go lower you got to go faster, it&rsquo;s crazy mechanics but it&rsquo;s truth, we only know this by living with it. We&rsquo;re going alter all our relationships as we live with bigger and bigger perceptions and handle bigger and bigger things. So this is also true, that the Sages knew that this brain can take a speeding up. Now Kriya as a technique is a psycho-physiological method to decarbonize the blood and to utilize the added oxygen that are transmuted as life energy into the cells. Let&rsquo;s go over, Kriya is a method that decarbonizes, psycho-physiological, it&rsquo;s a mind-body, it&rsquo;s a psychosomatic function that decarbonizes the blood and to utilize the added oxygen and produce a better life function in the mechanism. Now it is a natural way to slow down the aging of the cells and it&rsquo;s a natural way of transmuting the cells, but nature is doing this every eight years but very slowly, but same time nature is also tearing it down every eight years. Now the Sages know that it will take a million years in one little body form to experience this condition, it is impossible for the human being to live an exact million years to experience this condition of a transformation that is free from disease, free from pain, free from tensions of survival, free from the organizations of Man&rsquo;s ideas upon another man, it&rsquo;s gonna take millions of years to do that. So what they did was to experiment upon themselves to find out where there is a common link and they found the common link, both Eastern man and Western man. In the Western Man it is the Book of Revelations, Eastern man it&rsquo;s called the yogic science, but let us go back to a point that is universally true, the point that is universally true was the energy that passes through us through the medulla oblongata. This vital life energy which the Eastern word for it is pran or prana, the Western word for it is cosmic energy, it passes through the spinal column via the medulla oblongata, in the scriptures of the West it has been referred to as Mouth of God. Now let&rsquo;s take away the poetry, the philosophy, and go to the actual science, no doctor will take a knife and work on the medulla oblongata, he could not operate it&rsquo;ll cut the principle in the mechanism, the person will die, the life will sever itself. If you stick it to the pin, they&rsquo;ll die, if you try to tickle, open the brain, the skin, the scalp, and lift up the skull and just try to tickle it with a feather they will be paralyzed for life, yet he can operate at any other part of the body and in time he&rsquo;ll operate on many other parts that normally would not seem possible now, but he&rsquo;ll never work on the medulla oblongata because this is where we are fed naturally by this cosmic principle. 2:50 Now this is the common meeting ground both for Western man as well as Eastern man, it&rsquo;s the common meeting ground of the forces. Now the technique is based on this principle, that we cannot have a change in nature in any form without utilizing temperature, either hot or cold. If I want to alter this object, I have a choice to freeze it or burn it, if I freeze it it will remain the same, there may be moisture, there may be tensions but I want to change it definitely into ashes, I&rsquo;ll ignite it, it&rsquo;ll burn. Now if I want to make a change here, we also have to have an alteration of temperature in a mechanism, but nature has built her own thermostat in us, it&rsquo;s called metabolism. You have something in you that changes and it changes by regulation of the breathing, the intake of oxygen, it&rsquo;s a strange phenomenon but nevertheless it&rsquo;s a true phenomenon that goes on in us. If we now alternate the air intake in the mechanism and alternate the temperature changes on the mechanism, one minute of this process is equivalent to 365 days it will take nature you eating, sleeping, revolving around the sun in the zodiac to make that change. This may sound fantastic but it&rsquo;s not fantastic it has been proven over and over, right here in America we have American yogis who have never lived in India or China or any of those places, never even had a chance to be exposed to it, have actually practiced the technique and made the changes simply by knowing the science behind it, the change has occurred. Now why is this change necessary? The change is necessary because some of us have a low emotional tone and no amount of affirmation is going to alter the emotional tone for us, music will do it for a while, so as the colored people say &ldquo;sing the blues away,&rdquo; chant your blues, every race or religion has some musical principle to lift their emotional tone but when we get to an exact science now where we can directly direct our mind to the mechanism, we can now shift this emotional tone, we can shift it. If you are depressive by a certain way of showing you how to breathe in the Kriya, we can make the change, and if we take a sample of the blood after, a sample of the breathing after, we&rsquo;ll see the changes have occurred, so we have things to go by now for the first time, tangible and objective. Now this is not something mechanistic, this is something highly Divine and very sacred at the same time because you at no time can make air, you can&rsquo;t make the body, you can&rsquo;t make the brain, you&rsquo;re not a creator you&rsquo;re a generator, you generate out of your system replicas, you take from the substance in the atmosphere to utilize it, so what you are doing, you are altering the environment to suit yourself. The Sages don&rsquo;t teach us that, They teach us all to alter our cells to fit the environment, this is a different approach altogether. If this room is cold and a Sage walks in, He&rsquo;s not gonna tell you put on the fire because it&rsquo;s cold, He&rsquo;ll alter His mechanism, so His body refrigerates, or He would raise the heat in His mechanism to adjust. Now in Tibet and many other places they&rsquo;ve had examples right there in this country and in Canada, they&rsquo;ve done examples. Take a block of ice, take a Western yogi who had been taught how to breathe, and sit him there and let him melt the ice with his body heat by the fact of the Kriya breathing. Now this is something which you say how is this possible, this looks like a miracle? Forget the word miracle, this is a law but it&rsquo;s not used for that particular purpose just to melt ice, it is to organize our lives better so that we can now fit to environments which are very difficult to fit at times and since we have to learn to think on our feet most of the time, and this is where we&rsquo;re really trying to be interested in the science of yoga, unity with life, not just to sit down and lose yourself with meditation, the Sages are not telling us that. They have long told us that the practice, the living of it is Now, to transfer, to put it into action. So They immediately try to tell us we must put this thing into action. I&rsquo;m just saying that if you can alter this mechanism by knowing how to breathe, you alter the temperature, you&rsquo;re not a victim of the environment, if you&rsquo;re not a victim of the environment then you&rsquo;re a Master of the environment, you&rsquo;re a Master of the destiny. The room is destined to be cold and you&rsquo;re destined to shiver you understand and if you&rsquo;re destined to shiver sooner or later you get pneumonia. Now if you&rsquo;re a Master of this destination, this particular measurement or movement in these particular dimensions that you live in, sooner or later you realize you are mastering them by altering yourself, as you alter them you see it. Now a Master knows He lives in all dimensions, He doesn&rsquo;t live in one or two or three, He lives in all of them right now, He lives in length, breadth, and depth, He lives in time, He lives in motion, He lives in mind or feeling, and He lives in will, all of these at one time, He lives in them. He&rsquo;s not living in individual parts of it, but how did He arrive at an orientated unity with it? By watching and evolving himself with it, by speeding up Himself, He did that by a certain breathing technique because breath is life. Now for centuries before this was known in the West, the science of breath has long been practiced by the Orientals, yet when you pointed out to the Western world that the science of breath has always been with them, &ldquo;Oh gee whiz, only now I find out?&rdquo; The very first part of the English scriptures or Western scriptures says, &ldquo;God breathed into Man the breath of life and Man became a living Soul&rdquo; and when you point out Breath of Life is a principle, has always been with you, then you see the universalness of the thing, you don&rsquo;t see one man having something more than you, you see the universalness of it, it&rsquo;s a natural science. Now this Kriya which quickens the evolution and every</p>
<h2 id="1968---part-1-intuition">1968 - Part 1 Intuition</h2>
<p>Adano68_08_1IntuitionQ1RRNW6 - Well you see the thing is sometimes all these things fit themselves for a particular reasons. The two people on the plane were very interesting in this respect that the things that they said about themselves and the things that the conversation brought out for them, what was important the woman she has restored her own confidence back in people and personal things that she had to get rid of, she was glad she had to talk to someone and the man who was a diabetic returning home to a family to be rehabilitated as they haven&rsquo;t seen him for 25 years, he doesn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;s going to face the family and to have someone to talk to him, make him conscious. Now he says &ldquo;do you think I made it?&rdquo; The other woman says, &ldquo;you think I&rsquo;ll make it?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Yes, you both made it, you know why? Just think for it one moment, you were the only lucky sperm that became a human being out of the others that were trying from the mother and father and if you&rsquo;ve made it there, you&rsquo;ve got to make it all the way through. You made it today to this last plane, now you&rsquo;re gonna make it right to the next plane&rdquo; and it was surprising when the information came over back telling them that they could get the transportation, I says, &ldquo;well by your skin of your nose you can make it.&rdquo; Audience: Well how did they react to that sperm business. Adano: Well you know it&rsquo;s a peculiar thing, a person may be naive but when the obvious fact is presented they realize that this is really what they are. Truth is truth and you cannot avoid living with it and it&rsquo;s the only release we have, the obvious fact you are what you are, if you don&rsquo;t face that then you&rsquo;re nobody, you&rsquo;re just pretending to be somebody, the obvious fact of man&rsquo;s self, the mere fact that he made it as a human being is the fact that he&rsquo;s got to make it all the time as a human being in whatever dilemma he&rsquo;s in. The principle of success is already imprinted for the fact that he made it the first time to become the human being. Now let&rsquo;s say for the very first creation when Soul was implanted in body form to give it individuality, there he made it also, he was selected to be the first to take form, even if he made a repetition of forms, the selective point of being concrete or the selective point of coming out as a human being again is the actual thing, he cannot go back. Audience: What about the survival of the fittest, the elimination of the unfit and so forth? Adano: Who is surviving, is it the fit that is surviving or is the unfit that is surviving? Audience: Well the fit are surviving. Adano: No, the poor you always have with you, the unfit, there are more, poor in spirit, poor in mind, poor in body, everthing is more. Audience: The unfit have this experience and that&rsquo;s why we have a physical body. Adano: Right, there are more of them, we need this body. You see Master once said, &ldquo;When a man said to him Master you&rsquo;re fortunate to have so many beautiful Souls around You in a beautiful ashram, praying and meditating all day.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Impossible, this is only a hospital for sick Souls and this universe is that, a place for sick Souls. Once it&rsquo;s healed and can stand on its own, it doesn&rsquo;t need the universe.&rdquo; Audience: It goes on out the world. Adano: You&rsquo;re not going to be freed from anything, you&rsquo;re going to be free for responsibilities. Who think he&rsquo;s free from responsibilities only fooling himself. He&rsquo;s a weak person already because he&rsquo;s hiding like the ostrich with his head in the ground, running from the lion who eventually will eat him, a lion is chasing the ostrich and he outruns the lion and then there&rsquo;s his head in the ground as you go and hide and out comes the lion, devours him, he didn&rsquo;t free from the lion. Our consciousness is pushing us this way, there&rsquo;s a big difference in understanding ourselves, it&rsquo;s a hard thing though because we don&rsquo;t seem to want to&hellip; Audience: Well isn&rsquo;t there an awful lot of emphasis on&hellip; I mean advertising and everything else would lead you to think that to be free from responsibility, to be free from drudgery, to be free from everything, this is the ideal but it isn&rsquo;t true. Adano: This is your relativity, naturally you must remember how would you have something to compare and evaluate? You see without this environmental presentation or opportunity to be involved and to be trapped and to drown in, you&rsquo;re not going to be free from the concept of having something, you see to have or to have not. Our whole lives are concentrated on having, so we still believe we have a Soul when we are Soul. Now if you are Soul then to live the life of Soul is a different process, it&rsquo;s a different sense of focus, it&rsquo;s a different sense of evaluation, it&rsquo;s no longer emotion with passion, it&rsquo;s a reverse emotion which becomes devotion now by contemplation. You see you can be in the world and not be of the world but that doesn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re a cold potato, you can stay in this world of pure love and the same time you can be in love or be loved or wanting to be loved and the three last statements are all ego, the first one has no ego. If you are love what are you? Consciousness. You&rsquo;re not imposing, not requiring, in fact you are the first to serve, you&rsquo;re giving, and that&rsquo;s what the Masters would say &ldquo;freely give, freely receive,&rdquo; better to give, better than to receive. Consciousness gives, consciousness don&rsquo;t ask, consciousness responds. It&rsquo;s never demanding because there&rsquo;s no demand for it, it is consciousness. Audience: This works pretty much with what Krishnamurti was saying the other night, (inaudible) the very process of being&hellip; Adano: Freedom lies in being Self, but not being yourself. To be yourself is the collective concepts, impressions, emotions, expressions, exposures, all now dedicated for personal involvement or need or gain. Audience: After all this personal involvement gives you opportunities to learn techniques, to learn the technique of being. Adano: Yeah yeah, it&rsquo;s true, very true, without it you have nothing. Now that&rsquo;s why we learn from mistakes, mistakes are important, without the mistake you have no evaluation. That&rsquo;s why I like a cafeteria better than the ordinary restaurant, you have a wide selection, everyone can choose what he wants to eat. Now the same way in consciousness, you have a wider range of abilities available to you or ideas to apply yourself. Now Master Yogananda uses it, the bible is a book but the real bible is a human body, but the living bible is the example of one verse, now &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not&rdquo; is a verse in that bible, make your life an example of that, you are a living bible because that itself is miraculous, it can control the universe. 0:10 Anything would vibrate from that nature, to take one line and live, now this is a harder process, this is something that requires a re-evaluation of what I am, why am I get caught up in such a mechanism called flesh, and what really I&rsquo;m going to do with it. Now who am I supposed to be involved in this particular association. Now the goal of this whole association is towards realization of oneself and you call it self-realization, all right self-realization in another way can mean total memory, it can also be classified as Cosmic Consciousness. Audience: When you say total memory does that&hellip; Adano: Memory has no past, present, nor future, now total memory is total awareness, the wholeness of the thing. See this is another name for saying the same thing but if it&rsquo;s bringing now an objective involvement instead of a passive involvement&hellip; Audience: Too much of the passive involvement is what most people consider the way of life. I was reading something just the other day that said something, it may have been even Krishnamurti bringing it up, that the Eastern idea of retiring from life was not the fulfilling of life. Adano: Well it all had to do what they tried to (inaudible), must realize what they were writing about. First you have a principle truth about self, that is Man must achieve understanding of himself, now this is a principle he is dedicating his life to, how would you go about it? One, by algebraic methods of elimination, if you want to find an unknown quantity you put down X and you try a process of elimination, not this, not that, not this, not that and so you come down to what X really is, this is one process. Then the next process is to refrain from, that is a total abstinence, and therefore shrink yourself down into what you would involve yourself with, this is another method. Now that doesn&rsquo;t say that these methods are incorrect or they are ideal methods or they are the universal methods, these are natural biological functions which are mechanism gravitate to, you see. Now the third method is called the method of control, control has to do now with understanding the scientific laws, it has to do with understanding first. Now all the Masters would say before you want to be a disciple, gain understanding, study everything, don&rsquo;t become a disciple, don&rsquo;t get interested in this thing, try to know more about the mechanical world in which you live, try and compare, analyze, then eventually evaluate. Once you evaluate, if you can now see the relationship of this value in your association, then you have something to begin to control. So all right there&rsquo;s a conflict is going to happen, the Man who abstains is adamant, he takes a stand, he doesn&rsquo;t do this, he doesn&rsquo;t do that, and what happens? We have a very inhibited individual sooner or later because here he is. Now the other one who is exposed to analysis will try and then he too will find out that he may be a victim of latent desires, that he cannot get rid of some of them, and he will be over indulging in one desire, fooling himself that this is a means of escape from the other desire, you see? We do this too, &ldquo;I love peanut butter so I don&rsquo;t eat meat&rdquo; or &ldquo;I love this,&rdquo; you get caught up in one thing sooner it becomes an indulgence justifying your action. Now what you&rsquo;re trying to do finally in control is understanding the laws behind it and understanding its balance, then you decide inside, not by extreme methods, you decide within yourself how to apply it to your life. Now the Masters have said that Man should not eat such and such a type of food, he should not do such and such an act, because this is how he has to start the process of elimination and evaluation, arriving to himself. After a while the Master says &ldquo;No you must get involved, you must learn to understand why they are there&rdquo; so that the student rebels, &ldquo;Master why?&rdquo; One moment you said &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; and now you said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Master says, &ldquo;Well, trying to break you from fanatic action too, trying to break you from a chronic (inaudible), I want you to get flexible.&rdquo; So then the Master come along and says now &ldquo;There are better ways to exist without what you have just learned.&rdquo; So you think &ldquo;You told me vegetarian life is good, you told me this was good, and a moment later it&rsquo;s not good, then you said there are better ways than this, where do I really go?&rdquo; Then the student is really in turmoil, you would be in turmoil, so Master would say, &ldquo;all right.&rdquo; What He&rsquo;s trying to do is making you conscious of a particular function, that as long as you crave to do the thing, you are not free from the repercussions of the thing no matter how good it is. You see good karma is still craving, good actions you&rsquo;re still craving to do good actions to impress, are you doing good actions because it&rsquo;s natural to do good? You sit down here and say &ldquo;well maybe I go out and help my friend next door&rdquo; then you do go out and help him next door and when that&rsquo;s finished then you look around to do something for another person. Isn&rsquo;t this another craving, a craving to do? It isn&rsquo;t a matter that you shouldn&rsquo;t do, but then this particular action now becomes a disease, it&rsquo;s no longer an act of love no more or a natural act, it&rsquo;s not an act of control, it&rsquo;s strictly that you want you want to escape yourself through action. Most of us are caught up in this particular thing and this is another form of psychiatric disease, it&rsquo;s also a psychosomatic disease, they ever do good and they ever do bad, it&rsquo;s a form of disease too, it&rsquo;s not a freedom yet. A freedom and the real mastery is you&rsquo;re here and you have the consciousness and you perceive in the consciousness the goodness in Man. Now nine times out of ten when you&rsquo;re in that state, things will occur to help that individual unknowing to himself without even attempting to help him, I&rsquo;ll give a little illustration. Two days ago myself and Randy were in the coating yards. Randy came over to me says, &ldquo;Adano why don&rsquo;t we buy watermelon, take it home.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; &ldquo;why?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m teaching those people home there to meditate, it&rsquo;s about time they learn to use their telepathic consciousness, I&rsquo;m going to send them a thought right now and if they don&rsquo;t buy it then they they haven&rsquo;t passed, they&rsquo;re wasting time with meditation, they might as well go home and wasting my time.&rdquo; We drove home that evening and I&rsquo;m sitting at the table writing, open the door they came in, the first thing we asked, what did we ask? Audience: Did you buy a watermelon? Adano: And what did they say? Audience: Yes we did. Adano: All three looked at the watermelon for five or six minutes and didn&rsquo;t decide nothing at the same exact moment in time. 0:20 So what good? You didn&rsquo;t respond you see but that doesn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re criticizing you for this. We&rsquo;re trying to show what consciousness has to learn to work from within now, if it&rsquo;s going to learn to work from within, it will work from within, that you are reacting to the action which is intuitive and which is exact and correct and what you say? &ldquo;Non-airing action.&rdquo; This is Soul nature now, the Masters can only work through beings who respond, then They can give you more, other tasks, they can present you with more and more things to work with. Then you find yourself (inaudible) which is good though, well at least it was only one said he looked at the watermelon and said, &ldquo;well this was imagination.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s only one person that (inaudible) and made a big decision because all three of them at the same instant in time. This is what we&rsquo;re trying to find out you see, their consciousness was&hellip; Audience: The other two thought about watermelon but they didn&rsquo;t look at one. Adano: They all three looked at the watermelon, but none decided to take out the money to buy it and that was it. You see to receive an idea from God or from a spiritual person and say you have had the idea come to you is still weak until you apply action, until you apply action you don&rsquo;t conform and you don&rsquo;t gain strength, the inner strength is gained by the application of action. Now if they had applied the action then the reliance on this inner self to guide unerringly will become stronger now as they get the other thoughts sent to them on how to go deeper into themselves, then they will respond to it otherwise there&rsquo;s no response. Audience: That&rsquo;s sorta like this thing that we call it a hunch, every time you play your hunch, the hunches come in stronger. Audience: (Inaudible), there must be otherwise why would we follow our hunches to nowhere, it didn&rsquo;t come true. Adano: The human brain at the present time is in a state of nervous action by the involvement through the five senses you know and therefore it doesn&rsquo;t receive, the brain is like a radio, it&rsquo;s built like a radio, and it&rsquo;s just like a television set, now it can pick up and transmit. Now it&rsquo;s not turned off in a human being like that unit when it&rsquo;s pulled out of the plug, as long as you breathe you&rsquo;re turned on, the time you are not turned on is when you stop breathing and they put you in the grave or you may be turned down, not turned off. Now your five senses allow you to be trapped or involved in the world outside through activity, now when you withdraw through your five senses you only go one step back in, you go to a level that you call the semi-conscious or subconscious and into an intuitive level and you try to feel. Now through meditation you learn how to organize your feeling nature but you&rsquo;re not organizing your feeling nature to perform clairvoyance or telepathy or anything because these are specifics, you&rsquo;re trying to organize your nature so that it can commune and that is to have an actual communication between consciousness and consciousness, now the object being God realization. Well you are tuning back, no imagination comes into this picture because you&rsquo;re not attempting to imagine anything, when someone sends you this thought, you&rsquo;re going to stop dead in your tracks and react but if you don&rsquo;t act on the reaction, if you don&rsquo;t follow up with the physical movement then that wave that pass through you at the speed of light squared and since we only live on a planet that&rsquo;s about eight thousand miles in diameter, you see how fast this thing can go and come back to the center. It&rsquo;s going into all parts of the universe and coming back at the same time, it&rsquo;s not going anywhere, it&rsquo;s right here. Now the moment it sends out, if you are attuned you will pick it up, now you still have to act. If you remember in The Autobiography of Yogi, Sri Yukteswar sent Yogananda His disciple a mesSage and He was coming on a train, the other disciple did not listen to what Yogananda&rsquo;s receptivity told him, he says &ldquo;you and your intuition, I&rsquo;d rather trust the timetables of the train and go down the railroad track and meet the Master.&rdquo; (Inaudible), that&rsquo;s only normal, the other one stayed in his house and meditated. When he went down there, on the train there was no Master, he came back, by the time he had come back on his way back the Master had materialized to Yogananda and told him, &ldquo;I will be delayed on the train but you come on the next train and you will see Me walking behind a boy who&rsquo;s carrying a silver cup.&rdquo; A message was sent because now from radio it became television, the first message was radio, was thought transmission, the second message was television, he saw now. So the second time he grabbed ahold of his friend he says, &ldquo;come on, let&rsquo;s get back to the train and you&rsquo;ll see the Master coming down.&rdquo; He got there, the light is on the train already coming in, and he saw the Master walking behind the little boy. Now this brain here is exactly doing that all the time and in meditation you are trying to identify with this principle, so we&rsquo;re not trying to develop specifics, we&rsquo;re trying to organize this consciousness to tune in and in that way the Masters would educate you and raise your consciousness as you perceive Them. This is something that the Masters emphasize as you get into meditation but in the beginning or the start of meditation, They don&rsquo;t want you to get confused with psychic phenomena, They want you to concentrate on one of the basic things that they cannot take from you, you can lose the ability to be tele-visic, you can lose the ability to pick up thought waves by a blow on the head and permanent injury and then you no longer have all these qualities or it will diminish itself if it came to you by an accident as in the case of some psychics who have achieved this thing through an accident and that started to awaken and then slowly starts to diminish as that period starts to weaken but in a Master this don&rsquo;t happen. See a Master is united with the life principles, the audible life stream, God, He&rsquo;s hooked into this and He alone can transmit this awareness to you. Audience: What determines who&rsquo;s a Master and who isn&rsquo;t? Adano: A Master is Soul and knows that He is Soul and He knows that He doesn&rsquo;t have a Soul. Audience: I mean you know everybody&rsquo;s born and how does a Master know that He&rsquo;s&hellip; Adano: When you break the realization or the conviction that you have a Soul, that day you break that conviction, something will occur in you and from then on you are what you are, it is other people who call you Master, you never call yourself a Master, you know yourself as Soul. Now some people meet Them and can recognize this quality of Soul, it flows out of Them, every act is synchronized for Them to be at the right place, at the right time, for the right experience without any effort of Their own. 0:30 In other words they have no will from an ego it&rsquo;s all cosmic will working through them. They are placed in their lowliest position and things will happen right away for them, they have this capacity of exuding the love principles so unique in them that they don&rsquo;t have any interplay. Audience: You&rsquo;re saying that they&rsquo;re born rather than achieve it. Can someone work their way up to being a Master or is it something they are born with? Adano: Everyone potentially&hellip; you see the thing is when you use the words &ldquo;a&rdquo; Master, &ldquo;the&rdquo; Master, these are adjectives in front of a consciousness. The first thing Master is not a being, it&rsquo;s a state of awareness, the mastery of what? What are we trying to Master? Are we trying to master music, are we trying to master art, that makes us call ourselves Masters? What what are we trying to master in the first place? A master of what? What do they confer a mastery on? In the science of the Soul the conference of Mastery is the complete understanding of the laws of behavior and the mastery of these laws within your human mechanism and if we understand these laws how they function and master them, then we are free from the repercussions of thinking and if we are free from the repercussions of thinking, &ldquo;as we think so it becomes,&rdquo; it materializes instantly. Now those individuals who have reached this stage have broken from the concept that they HAVE a Soul to the realization now that they ARE Soul. It takes people who are in need for upliftment to turn to some people like that and ask for guidance, so we say we have to go and seek a Master, why? I haven&rsquo;t mastered my behavior, I haven&rsquo;t mastered my nature, I don&rsquo;t know much about this mechanism, I can&rsquo;t go to a musician to teach me that, I have to go to someone who has mastered the art of behavior, where do I find him? Now we don&rsquo;t find Him, He pulls us to Him when we are ready for it. He draws us to us when we are ready for it, we don&rsquo;t meet a Master on our own steam because you can go and slam right into His presence if you think by your own pressure and sit there and get nothing and you will only see an ordinary man, you see nothing else, He will never reveal anything of His nature to you. There was a Catholic minister who traveled all through India searching for one Master who would perform a miracle and found none and came back and says &ldquo;there are no Saints or miraculous things in India, it&rsquo;s just people who sit down and pray.&rdquo; Now, and there was a man who didn&rsquo;t go any place and he was a doctor performing his work and one day while he was going to a certain house with all his medical knowledge he told the parents I&rsquo;m sorry this child will pass on, he can do nothing and there was an old man standing not too far from the door, he was just an innocent bystander and he made a remark he says &ldquo;well that is left to be seen.&rdquo; So the doctor took an offense as if to say &ldquo;well what do you know?&rdquo; Well he saw the child die in front of his eyes the doctor did and when everything was done and he had given the death certificate the old man says, the boy&rsquo;s name was Ram, he says, &ldquo;Ram, let&rsquo;s go for a walk, it&rsquo;s about time.&rdquo; Ram got off the ground, he and the old man took off. That doctor ran after that old man to find out what knowledge he knew but as fast as he could run behind the two, he could never catch up with them. He tried, he ran through the jungle always close and it was years after he did, that man came to him and that old man, the supposed old man came to him when he was dying from the disease and He touched him and healed him and he asking Him what is His name and He told the doctor His name was Guru, He said &ldquo;My name is Guru.&rdquo; Now the doctor didn&rsquo;t know Hindu or anything, He said Guru, that was it. &ldquo;Okay Guru tell me something about myself?&rdquo; He spent eight years after that with that man realizing what this mechanism is for the first time but then again with his medical knowledge he understood it better than the average individual who had no medical knowledge having to take it sheerly on (inaudible) and testing. The doctor knew he could bridge, he could jump the evolutionary gaps in his consciousness with this other and he reached the high state of realization, unbelievable how these Masters can work. Now He did not say to the man &ldquo;I was a Master&rdquo; and He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;My name is Master,&rdquo; He said Guru was his name and He came to the man when the man was dying, the doctor didn&rsquo;t find the man. The doctor was dying, he was dying from tropical disease, and the same old man came to him and healed him. Now in any person who had any spiritual experience with these Masters, they&rsquo;ll always tell you the honest truth that they couldn&rsquo;t find a Master, they tried on their own, a Master found them out. Now people tell you that this is a Master from their own personal experience or from exposure to it and they would suggest that you go and contact that person and you know what? Sometimes, nine out of ten times, there are so many obstacles thrown in your way you never seem to make it and you ask yourself why and I know some people who have written a living Master to be initiated and they got their reply, go to somebody that they recommend in America some place, let them talk to you first, that&rsquo;s the funny part of it. Now you say &ldquo;Well why this man will not accept me?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a tremendous undercurrent, tremendous awareness working that these Masters don&rsquo;t impose, They know where They can go and as Paul once said and I remember him saying it, &ldquo;the Masters can only use those who have reached a certain level of inner discipline and inner understanding that They can work with them.&rdquo; If you haven&rsquo;t come to a certain inner discipline with yourself, well it&rsquo;s like a cup, you have a small cup, you have a big cup, you can only fill that much inside. So what They&rsquo;re trying to do or trying to make us conscious of, if we meditate and widen the range of our understanding through the meditation, then our receptivity for Them will be great enough for Them to use us so we can be a channel for Them until that time we don&rsquo;t have anything. Audience: You&rsquo;ve got to be in complete&hellip; there&rsquo;s something more than control, it&rsquo;s a state of beingness. Adano: Surrender is one, surrender, a self-surrender of oneself and love. See, if we cannot surrender, it don&rsquo;t come, there is still some form of ego. I remember knowing a certain man, his name was Albert Clift, his whole mission was based on three words, no four words, &ldquo;Let go, let God.&rdquo; 0:40 He built his entire mission on that whole four words and I&rsquo;ve seen the miracles of people that he healed and the consciousness that he uplifted on those four words, he had nothing else to tell you, you sat down and he says, &ldquo;Let go, let God,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t do anything because you&rsquo;re not going to do anything. Audience: Well you know what, to the ordinary people this sounds like you&rsquo;re not being self-responsible, you&rsquo;re letting somebody else do what you ought to do. I can well understand why lots of people won&rsquo;t let go, let God. I think people probably generally feel they have to have reached a place where they&rsquo;re self-responsible, self-organized, self um&hellip; Adano: That&rsquo;s ego, that&rsquo;s still ego, remember this you see when you come in contact with a Guru and He initiates you into the audible life stream, the bonnie, the cosmic song that you hear like a bell ringing all around you, sometimes it has the sound of a flute, a harp, the sound of the ocean, in fact most of time it&rsquo;s a high electronic whine, and you can see the flash of light around you sometimes flicking around, then you know the Guru is a manifestation of the God consciousness in body. Now that Guru gives you one command, that is make yourself a fit vehicle to receive this awareness, that is learn how to live. So He imposes what is called a regimen of diet, a regiment of behavior, it&rsquo;s a cleansing process, it&rsquo;s a cleaning out process for two reasons. This inner consciousness cannot work properly without a cleansing process and Ralph Waldo Trine once said in his writings, &ldquo;How can the divine consciousness find any sense of complacency of virtue in a tabernacle that is polluted?&rdquo; How can you do the utmost with your nature if you don&rsquo;t have a sense of harmony here because you can only transmit to others what you got in harmonious in yourself, you&rsquo;re not going to transmit anything else see? So get back inside and clean this up so the Gurus are saying this is what you have to do. Now when They connect you to this thing since the Guru is a manifestation of the awareness in body form, the Guru is doing the will of God, He&rsquo;s not doing anybody&rsquo;s will, He has no will of His own, He&rsquo;s the will of God all the time. Now His acts are only for the awakening of individuals away from their sense involvement to an inner awareness, an inner type of behavior, and the work of God as Jesus said, &ldquo;I should be about My Father&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; I should be about helping individuals to recognize their God nature, that&rsquo;s the work that these Masters are doing. The will of God is that every man must recognize God for himself, in other words They are bringing you face to face with the issue then the issue is &ldquo;Am I Soul or do I have Soul?&rdquo; Well there&rsquo;s a story with a lioness one time, she was pregnant and she saw some sheep and she chased them and in the process of chasing she dropped down from exhaustion and died and the lambs all came around and took the lion and reared it as their own, the sheep took the baby lion and raised it. The lion grew up and ate grass and cried just like a sheep, he couldn&rsquo;t roar, he didn&rsquo;t know how to roar as a lion, a full grown lion. One day a lion came down from the hills and was hungry and he saw the sheep and sheep is a natural food and decided to chase it, just then he saw the lion running too from him in fear from the roar because the sheep was accustomed to the roar, that this meant danger, death, run, and he wanted to know why the lion running away from, gave chase, he caught the lion and the lion started to cry out like a sheep, couldn&rsquo;t cry like a lion, and the lion dragged it to the river and pushed his head in the water and said &ldquo;Look, you see, you&rsquo;re like me, now roar like a lion and go eat a sheep.&rdquo; The lion realized who he was and this is the business of Masters. We are sheep in consciousness when we think we HAVE Soul, we are lions when we realize we ARE Soul. Now you know why they call the man a lamb of God, the Sikh? He is the seeker of God, he seeks God, then after he seeks God he becomes the Sadhu, he becomes the renunciate by voluntary action, not by no compulsion of the environment, no environmental push forces him to renounce anything, he doesn&rsquo;t renounce because something went bad in his life, because his business went bad or his wife left him, or something happened to him to renounce (inaudible). Audience: It&rsquo;s not negative renunciation but a positive. Adano: First he sought right here within himself after his nature then he voluntarily accept the renunciation which means the re-alignment of himself and then he goes on to the Sant or the Satnam or the Saint, he comes to the sane mind, he lives a sane life now for the first time, not pulled by environment and not pulled by any unnecessary desire pattern in his makeup, the first time he&rsquo;s going to face his God as life. He knows life now as (inaudible) and this takes time, he needs the initiation, he needs the Guru because the Guru is the example, the Guru is a stamp of Soul, without Him we don&rsquo;t have anything, we cannot say what Soul would look like, Soul is constantly giving love, this is its nature. Now it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not giving you the idea how to be in love, it&rsquo;s not giving you the idea that it wants to be loved, if it was giving you the idea it wanted to be love, it&rsquo;s not Soul because to want something is because you lack something. Audience: You&rsquo;re very wanting indicates a lack. Adano: And to be in love is the fact that you don&rsquo;t know how to be out of it, but love is a quality to which we aspire and become. The Guru gives this because He opens this in you, this is what He calls the unconditional love of the Soul and there is no conflict&hellip; Audience: this is why Krishnamurti says in this book you know, he said &ldquo;I am simply a religious Man. If somebody coming near me, as often happens, finds himself renewed or absolved of a problem or something he said, it isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;ve deliberately tried to help him, it&rsquo;s just because I am.&rdquo; Adano: You see people who have worked towards realizing themselves as Soul sooner or later realizes one thing, that everything that is happening to you had to happen to them too. In other words you cannot tell somebody something about themselves that they did not want to experience inside themselves, see you have to experience it inside. How are you gonna know what it is when a mosquito bites you if you&rsquo;ll never experience the mosquito bite but you know what pain is. If somebody comes along and says the mosquito bit me and you says, &ldquo;oh well, that ain&rsquo;t nothing.&rdquo; Well it&rsquo;s not you, you&rsquo;re ain&rsquo;t feeling it but if you felt it, there&rsquo;s compassion then you can sense it. Now the Masters are saying &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to go and expose yourself all the time to all these different conditions just to have understanding, you can achieve this understanding by meditative practices, by self-cultivation.&rdquo; You can come into this understanding of yourself through the cultivated attitude of meditation. 0:50 Now in meditation what you&rsquo;re doing? You&rsquo;re seeking how to refocus your whole life from within yourself, consciously, and to act it out without any motivation for personal satisfaction or aggrandizement or enhancement or personal gain, this is the nature that comes out from you. A person who is meditative can sit down here and you know what will happen in half an hour if people are passing there? It will aggravate them, the fact that they can sit down so quiet. Audience: Does it react on their nature some way or what? Adano: To sit in quietness and to distill the consciousness away from emotional involvement to devotional involvement will automatically set up waves in the atmosphere that cause people to be aggravated. Audience: Wouldn&rsquo;t it cause them call them to be quiet, wouldn&rsquo;t it cause them to feel serene? Adano: If you are nervous, their serenity aggravates you until you decide to stop being nervous and then you will feel a serenity but it&rsquo;s an aggravation at the time when it starts working at you. You may be drawn to sit down there in quietness but it&rsquo;s going to aggravate you too. Now this is an experience that everyone has had in meditation, you sit down for the first time in meditation and you feel relaxed then after a month or two meditation on your own, don&rsquo;t it start to peter out like if you&rsquo;re beating your head against a wall to meditate? Who have never had this particular condition that say that they sat down now after a month meeting someone who meditates, before they were restless and now they&rsquo;ve sat down for a month and they feel this kind of joy and now they&rsquo;re on their own and all of a sudden they seem to run into a blank wall, there is nothing coming out from their meditation and the meditation seems to die out. Audience: Well maybe it&rsquo;s a different situation, in my work I frequently have to get two parties together sometimes or even one party was antagonistic to an idea and by being serene and quiet and not absorbing any of his excitement or his worries, gradually he does quiet down, begins to study the problem objectively instead of emotionally but he seems to absorb some of my quiet rather than being dissatisfied with it. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s something I do or maybe it&rsquo;s because I consciously try to feel for his general good perhaps that&rsquo;s all, I don&rsquo;t know. Adano: You are doing it Paul, you are applying it, applying the natural law of exemplary suggestion. This is by example which suggests to the other individual how to follow a principle of what is called behavior within himself. Audience: I probably would have agitated him if I meditated in his presence. Adano: All right you would because you cannot stand the individual, not able to stand their vibration, but as he tapers off in nerve action, as he tapers off his emotional drive, and feels the the pull now, there is a pull, then the agitation slows down and then he starts to feel a synchronization with you, he feels an affinity with you, he seems to be one with you for a while. Now he feels uplifted, now he says to you, &ldquo;Man I never felt so relaxed by sitting in your presence for the first time. Boy this really feels good, I should involve myself with it.&rdquo; Then you listen and you say to yourself, &ldquo;Well you better watch out, you don&rsquo;t know what you just said.&rdquo; You may take your foot out of your own mouth because he is trying to get there too fast, what has taken you many years to accomplish. Your serenity as it is projected out did not come overnight, believe me it didn&rsquo;t come, it came from years of actual working inside yourself and someone says he&rsquo;s gonna gain it overnight by trying to push it all at one time, it would collapse the whole building of his entire structure of makeup. It takes some time for him to find out why certain ideas can work and why they cannot, he has to live it, it not something you can do right away. You know sometimes meditation can be so dead and you can sit down for hours and get nothing then all of a sudden for five seconds you can get everything and then for five seconds you don&rsquo;t get nothing and then all of a sudden you can want to stay in meditation for hours without wanting to come out because it never comes the way you (inaudible), it&rsquo;s not something you can regulate. To say today I will meditate and have the best meditation, this moment I&rsquo;m going to have the best, it&rsquo;s not gonna work that way, it never does work that way, it always out trick us, it always deludes us. In other words this divine principle there is no room for ego on our part in regulating it, it is surrender all the time, that&rsquo;s why Jesus would say &ldquo;Not My will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;Father remove this cup&rdquo; but He can&rsquo;t remove the cup because there will be still His ego asking for something to stop the turmoil, to stop the anxiety, the impending doom that is going to come to Him. Yet He has to accept the surrender by saying &ldquo;Not My will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; He has to accept now a higher law but you see in His meditation what did He see that He could make this surrender? He had to have an inner vision, an inner revelation for Him to make the surrender. He saw within Himself that if He had this experience removed without being exposed to this death, this horrible death through His own ego, He would still be subject to reincarnation. Now since He would surrender to it and take on the cross or take on the responsibility and not be freed from responsibility and now gain a strength to be for responsibility, a freedom for the responsibility of the involvement, He saw resurrection, He saw ascension, these were levels of awareness He saw within Himself then He was happy to go to His Calvary, He didn&rsquo;t go to his Calvary in a state of sadness. People think that Jesus died in a sad state, He was the happiest man that ever lived because when someone came crying you know what He said on His way to Calvary, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep for Me, weep for yourself.&rdquo; You see He realized that the levels of His being because if we weep for Him having to die, then we are weeping with an attachment, we are not weeping with the understanding that this is a realized being and a realized being don&rsquo;t have these qualities because They&rsquo;re free from having, They are, They know they are Soul, They love Mankind so much, They go even beyond what is demanded of Them by pointing out that the Divine Intelligence would absolve us from our own stupidities, our own ignorances. Well let&rsquo;s meditate, enough of talking about this thing you know, you can talk all night about the realization of life and how to live this life, but if you don&rsquo;t meditate it don&rsquo;t work. Audience: (inaudible) before you came we were meditating? Adano: I don&rsquo;t think you were meditating. Okay if you were meditating&hellip; Audience: How come I didn&rsquo;t know you were coming? Adano: I sent every one of you messages, I sent everyone messages I was coming. Audience: This is Mrs. Prince&rsquo;s first night of meditation so she knew you were coming, she got the message by other means. Adano: Yeah I knew that one, that&rsquo;s how she came to be here tonight. 1:00 Audience: Well we were already planning on coming with her for the first time, so that might have some significance, Wednesday or Thursday we decided, no it was just last evening. Adano was already planning on this thing. Adano: (Laughter) You see thing is thought&hellip; see let&rsquo;s realize one thing, there are no miracles in this world, the great Masters do not teach miracles, the greatest miracle that They would tell you of is the love of God in Man, but They have what is called a definite path to that love, there&rsquo;s a definite step-by-step way of treading this love or treading this path to God. Now They cannot teach you what They have not experienced and They&rsquo;re not going to tell you anything new, it&rsquo;s the same thing They&rsquo;re going to tell you over and over and after a while it&rsquo;s going to sound like a broken record you know, you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard this thing over and over, where do I go from here&rdquo; but the Masters will point out you go HERE all the time for the God-self, the Tisra Til, the third eye, the Christ center, all these are only names for going back inside. Now Jesus says &ldquo;If thine eyes are single then the&hellip;&rdquo; the translator left are the one important Hebrew word which meant single visioned or single focused, &ldquo;the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t know the reason why that word had to be left out, I guess the the poor fellow, what is he going to do with two eyes, single focus, but focus on what? You see many of the Master&rsquo;s teachings or great Sages teachings are so hidden in their language that we hear the language and interpret the language, but we don&rsquo;t even get the truth of the language. Audience: Is anyone re-translating it who has the background? Adano: Yes there is now a living Master who is doing it now for the first time, they have a few who&rsquo;ve done it but it&rsquo;s not published. Master Yogananda did write on part of it but it&rsquo;s not published because before He passed away He had written that until this world has seen certain advancement in scientific laws, they would not understand the fruits of Christianity. See a Master does not teach Churchianity, He will teach you Christianity and Jesus did not teach Christianity. Audience: Are you saying Jesus did not teach Christianity? What do you call what He was teaching? Adano: The Science of the Soul, you see? Now a Master will tell you what Christianity is because it is the Science of the Soul, you see the people call the teachings of Jesus Christianity because it was His utterances as to what the Science of the Soul was doing, now John and all these other men realized this. Now in His disciple relationship with His 12 disciples you know He says &ldquo;Who do men say that I am?&rdquo; Now automatically when you hear that statement you say &ldquo;Well who do men say that this Man is?&rdquo; Physical, personal, or otherwise, right away you&rsquo;re trapped into making a commitment, so He said some people said that He was a prophet, others said He was some holy man or a Master, then all of a sudden, like a brain wave, Peter said &ldquo;Thou art Christ, Son of the living God&rdquo; and the Master replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you that, I didn&rsquo;t say that, you said it, I didn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;The Father revealed it to you.&rdquo; Well what was the Father that revealed to Peter? Did He reveal that this body was the Son of God or this intuitive consciousness in Peter got a glimpse of what the God consciousness is in Man when he looked upon the physical form and knew that this God consciousness now was Soul, an example of Soul, and you ask the question &ldquo;How does a Man know another one is Master?&rdquo; This is where it came, this is the real scientific thing, &ldquo;Who do men say that I am?&rdquo; A Master never say He&rsquo;s a Master, it&rsquo;s impossible for Him to say He&rsquo;s a Master, if he does say that, he&rsquo;s not a Master. Audience: Is that principle in the religion prior to Jesus? Adano: Yes. Audience: Is it in the religious writings prior to Jesus? Adano: Yes it is, it&rsquo;s in every religious writings of every true religious science. Well actually in the Science of the Soul itself this is it, the recognition that comes from the disciple to the Guru and knowing that the Guru is living in Christ consciousness. See Christ consciousness is the Greek translation for Kutastha Chaitanya which is a Sanskrit word meaning the total awareness intuitive present in vibratory creation and subject to the power of will and thinking and it is a cosmic light. Now Krishna, Lord Krishna, His name was Gopal, He lived in this light and this is a blue light. Now they always paint this thing as blue, the body from here up as if this being is a blue faced being or something because the cosmic conscious light is white and it encapsulates a blue light and around this blue light there&rsquo;s a gold ring and when you close your eyes and look inside and Jesus said &ldquo;When your eyes are single vision, the whole body is full of light&rdquo; you will see a light pulsating in there, that is Mount Sinai, that is the burning bush of Moses. Moses developed in Egypt, which was the midbrain, and then came to Mount Sinai after he left Egypt and was thrown out of Egypt to live in the higher brain of Mount Sinai. This is the real Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai is not only the little piece of rock, He had to sit down to meditate to raise his consciousness from this level of psychic practices, this is the solar plexus, this midbrain, this is another brain but it&rsquo;s not the real brain, it does all the similar functions but the real brain is here. So He had to raise His consciousness away from here, from psychic phenomena, because the Egyptians knew of psychic phenomena and they even challenged Him when He came back to challenge them with his knowledge that he was He was a liberated man for the first time, He wasn&rsquo;t trapped in psychic practices, he wasn&rsquo;t trapped in extrasensory specifics, He was a real Realized Soul for the first time. He began to draw the energy and look inside here in the side and in this nature here, this very center here, He saw the light and by seeing the light for the first time He knew it had three colors. Now He asked in that light, &ldquo;What is your name Lord?&rdquo; This radiant light, what is its name? Because name is important, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;My name is Paul Baurice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;My name is Mrs. Pitts.&rdquo; Name is important for identity. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; This light here, shining within Man, and within the very consciousness came the answer &ldquo;I am that I am.&rdquo; Now if you recall there&rsquo;s a part in the scriptures that says &ldquo;Be thou still and know that I AM is God.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Be thou still know that The I AM is God&rdquo; or &ldquo;A I AM is God.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a big difference, a different a sense of focus, a different realization altogether, it&rsquo;s an experience that comes that the &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; principle of all things is God already. God has slowed down from pure consciousness into energy, into matter, the three levels which you call Trinity, the Holy Vibration, or Holy Ghost is matter, the actual substance in which this universe is constructed from. 1:10 Now when this matter starts to vibrate back, it becomes pure energy, it becomes Christ, intuitive, it takes on the vibratory nature of the totalness of life. Now when it starts getting past that, that&rsquo;s why I says &ldquo;No man sees God now what has felt His presence and has seen the light,&rdquo; from energy we go to consciousness and it&rsquo;s true consciousness we perceive consciousness, we don&rsquo;t see anything else but the light of God. The light of God is constant and the name of God is constant, there are only two realities are constant, the light and the sound, this sound is like a music it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s going on in the right ear all the time. Now John the Divine when He wrote this experience after it was revealed to Him and remember I said Peter had his own revealed to him what was happening in Jesus body so he said &ldquo;Thou art Christ, Son of the Living God,&rdquo; most people thought he meant s-o-n you know. Now if the God is a light, what would be the manifested light but a smaller sun, an s-u-n and what did Moses see? A little sun, a little light burning inside, it&rsquo;s a light so here John saw the same thing, he saw the inner light inside. Now he said also in his writings that more than the light was a sound, he didn&rsquo;t say that the light was the first thing, he said &ldquo;In the beginning was the word,&rdquo; in the beginning was sound, vibration, the cosmic principle, the OM, the bond, the logos, this principle. This cosmic sound is here all the time  and we don&rsquo;t hear it first, we hear it second and see the light first but if you take two clouds and hit them together in nature we see the lightning first and here the thunder second, was the thunder first before the light? They had to hit first before they can make a sound, before light could come together, you have to hit before you can spark, you see the illusion that we live under? The real reality that sound was first before light but because light travels faster than sound, we see the light first and hear the sound after. Yet in reality the sound was first and the sound is second and the sound is last, it&rsquo;s first, middle, and last, in other words now &ldquo;in the beginning was the sound,&rdquo; the word, &ldquo;and the word was with God,&rdquo; in other words it pre-existed the light. So it has to be God though consciousness &ldquo;and the word was God,&rdquo; cosmic sound is God already, it ain&rsquo;t nothing else, and it&rsquo;s pure consciousness because when you enter it, it&rsquo;s a cosmic principle because true Man, he&rsquo;s making communion with it. &ldquo;And the word was made flesh,&rdquo; this sound principle now slows down and became body so if you say God made you, this is true to a certain extent but it&rsquo;s incorrect to another extent because it is a sense of separation existing in that statement. If you say God has become you then there is a sense of identity and synchronization and unity with it and there&rsquo;s a sense of freedom. Audience: We saw a chart last week that this is beginning.. it all is making sense what we&rsquo;re talking about the other night, this chart is giving your rates of vibration that the ear can hear, you know the higher and the lower notes, and you hear that only down only when the notes are just so low anything below that we can&rsquo;t hear or anything above that we can&rsquo;t hear but as the vibration goes higher, the first thing you know it reaches a place where it is something, you have the spectrum of light and you see. Now the thing that keeps bugging me that I haven&rsquo;t got out, there are ranges of vibration in here, is that taste, smell, or what? If part of these vibrations represent what I see and part what I hear, what do the rest of these vibrations represent? Is this this energy you&rsquo;re talking about that that is consciousness? Adano: Yes, yes, yes, it is, it is. This consciousness, this cosmic vibration which you call Holy Ghost in the churches is actual Science of the Soul, is here existing already. Now it slows down, it is God already, the pure vibration in different ranges, it slows down and you hear it and it takes part into the physical mechanism because it says &ldquo;the Word was made flesh and dwelt in Man.&rdquo; This thing has dwelt in us, it remains in us. Now we need techniques to awaken it, we can experience this on our own unconsciously but by the aid of techniques, we can experience this thing consciously. Now light is here, everything we see around here is a form of congeal light, why? We have a modern-day scientist who was modern day Patanjali, see Patanjali wrote that this whole universe is Maya, illusion, and left it at that, then the modern day Patanjali came along and went one step further in mathematics, his name was Albert Einstein, this universe is relativity, mathematically now it is accurate. What is this world around us? The result of an optical illusion by light, here it&rsquo;s called relativity, Maya is the same thing, they call it illusion. Now this is not an illusion in the sense that the mind thinks it&rsquo;s an illusion, it is the result of certain principles working upon themselves to create the illusion for the five senses. The world exists as pure energy, as pure consciousness but the illusion is there also to trick us. There is a very good reason why it&rsquo;s there to trick us, because this is a world of phenomena, we live in a phenomenal world and the only time this phenomenal world can absolve itself like a bubble, an ocean is the result of many bubbles, you understand, or many little drops of water, so the universe is a result, the pure consciousness is a result of many like forms pulling back themselves or expressing themselves individually all the time. So Einstein says energy, this whole universe here, is equal to the mass, the actual mass of substance, times the velocity of light squared because it&rsquo;s the only actual phenomenal constant that don&rsquo;t deviate, it&rsquo;s a constant, it&rsquo;s something that is here that can be measurable, that remains. So they use a formula like E representing energy, M for the mass, C for the constant for light, squared. Now how are we going to prove that a constant is a constant, then every other thing can be broken down and the constant is not supposed to be broken down, it&rsquo;s supposed to be something to measure by. Now how is he going to bridge what the Sages have said that God is light and this is a world of illusion and illusion is all the result of light, he&rsquo;d have to get the constant, you&rsquo;d have to find a constant light, so where&rsquo;s the constant light? He lives in this world and he looks up in the sky and he sees the constant light, the burning earth in the form of a sun emitting a light. Now he has to measure that constant, he has to measure that light to see if it&rsquo;s constant and somebody came along and found a way how to measure it. They took a couple of mirrors, they bounced it off a tunnel area, and from one mirror to the next mirror and how long it takes to cross that tunnel over a certain distance gave them the measurement. Now they&rsquo;ve came up with exactly a figure which you call 186,000 miles per second squared, using this as a constant there is nothing in this earth now that moves as fast as that, so with this as a constant we have established a radio wave now, an electrical wave, we have established a constant. 1:20 Now but he says it&rsquo;s squared so I made Arnold Howard one time not too long ago he&rsquo;s arguing and I said, &ldquo;No let&rsquo;s multiply 186,000&rdquo; and gave him a paper and pencil. He spent 15 minutes to figure out the big figure what it will be. Now this is moving for a second squared, now this is pure energy, the Saints are telling you that God is spirit, God is energy, spiral energy, it&rsquo;s energy here all the time, it&rsquo;s consciousness, the Saints didn&rsquo;t it was not and that thinking, that is this beautiful brain that this Creator made, was the master key of utilizing it but not through emotion but by devotion, you see the devotion can pull this thing into action. So if you send a thought out, it has now been gradually established that thought is energy, it&rsquo;s not something that doesn&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s a force, it&rsquo;s a force that the brain emits, it triggers it off which is electrical discharge. Now if this is an electrical discharge with the intensification by concentration based upon the desire behind it, this discharge would have a tremendous impact and the closest thing that this can come to as far as modern scientists is able to look at is the laser beam. Now the Masters Jesus when they heal, you know they&rsquo;re not saying that They weren&rsquo;t calling from God but with God first we must understand what God is. He&rsquo;s not somebody sitting in the throne, He is cosmic principles, principles that are not going to change, principles that we may have to change ourselves to accept, principles that we may have to learn how to live with for the first time. So these principles are here, they are established as truth and the scientist is saying to the world &ldquo;I am looking for the truth of my existence, the truth of this creation, what is the basic cause?&rdquo; The Saint is saying, &ldquo;I am looking too for the basic cause of this truth but I&rsquo;m looking also how to be the channel for the basic cause.&rdquo; Audience: How to be a channel? Adano: Right, how to be the channel for the basic cause. I just don&rsquo;t want to use the basic cause as some sort of a rabbit foot existence, I just don&rsquo;t want to plow through this thing and sort of make it a sort of a circus. Scientist is saying he&rsquo;s trying to break down and find this basic cause, this connecting link, the Saint says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to find to make myself a channel for it.&rdquo; Now we find out that a scientist is unable to be a channel for it but a scientist does get glimpses within his own mechanism how the basic cause works at times through inspiration, through super conscious gaps, or jumps or intuition, and this puzzles him now. I have a friend who was working with me in New Orleans, his uncle is one of the head in gamma ray research and he told me what his uncle has said, I spoke to him and he said, &ldquo;my uncle is interested in meditation,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;after he heard you talk on a tape&rdquo; he sent him this tape, he got so interested and this man is the head in gamma ray research and he said, &ldquo;Adano made a statement at a certain time when the mind is quiet you can see a light flash.&rdquo; He says he has seen this many times and many of his ideas that came for research came at that moment when the light flashed in his consciousness, he would see it like a thing light up for a brief moment. I said it would last for half an hour and he would have all the answers to his problem but he never could trigger this thing off and when he heard me define that &ldquo;the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehends it not,&rdquo; he said that was the thing that made him realize what I was talking about because he saw always when he closed his eyes but he didn&rsquo;t know how to go in there and after he says hearing me talk about how Jesus&hellip; he went back and got himself a brand new testament and he&rsquo;s taking Him word for word as a scientist and he tells us his nephew he says, &ldquo;Now the life of Jesus has an entire difference meaning all together as an actual science,&rdquo; for the first time he&rsquo;s seeing it strictly as atomic science. Now this man is a very spiritual Man. Now he&rsquo;s not a churchanistic type of man though he&rsquo;s supposed to be interested in helping the Church in the community but from his own inner life now he has begun now to take this book and see it as it really is and he realized now that Jesus did not teach what they call churchianity or christianity, He was teaching the Science of Soul and it actually was always there all the time, this principle of the body. Now look at it one way before we meditate, all scriptures say that this is the temple of the living God, they don&rsquo;t say it is anything else, why they say it&rsquo;s a temple of living God? And I said before if we realize that God became this body by slowing down, where else would He remain in but in the body but we don&rsquo;t know what God is so we automatically assume that we cannot arrive at this consciousness. We have a type of conviction that He has to be some creature sitting on a throne, dispensing miraculous powers, dispensing this and absolving you from your misconducts, when in reality He is a principle of two forces working through for a realization of the unity of these two forces, you see? That&rsquo;s why we say we seek realization, we seek to unite ourselves with God, that&rsquo;s where the word yoga comes in meaning unity with God. Audience: It is a real synchronization. Adano: It is synchronization, you&rsquo;re not going any place outside. The unity of life or the synchronized life is the life of devotion but it&rsquo;s not devotion in a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude like most people would want you to think. Devotion is synchronized emotion without the lust and the passion and the desire patterns that make up for repercussion in thinking, without that, devoid of that, this is pure devotion. Now I have seen more devoted people in business than those that went to church because they had a greater sense of responsibility to the people who they gave employment to and the commitment to their fellow Man in the world of finance, though they themselves would need the finance to carry on, but there was a wider sense of awareness in a devoted nature and the commitment of a whole as Man and there you saw the purest of devotion again coming out. They were not emotionally involved, they did not went around in some emotional way and to impress. Audience: They were living up to the highwest law. Adano: This is pure devotion devotion. You see we&rsquo;re not being taught or exposed to the real essence yet as to the Soul, we&rsquo;re still toddling along with churchanistic concepts of what the thing really is yet and we have to shell away this whole morass, you know you want to eat a banana what you do? You tear off the peel and you eat the banana you can make bananas split and do all kinds of things and the same thing, you want to get to the real essence of your nature, you got to cut out a great deal of impressions that have been there that hold you back. Now and you&rsquo;ll find that agricultural Man and industrial Man will bridge their lives. Audience: Although as you say this churchianistic, what you say is true there still, do you ever appear in a church? Adano: Let me put it this way, I&rsquo;ll be in the churches, I go. Audience: That&rsquo;s the program I mean, I guess you would be the center, the focus, if you went. Adano: I go in church and meditate. Audience: You&rsquo;d be willing to, what I&rsquo;m driving that, we have Sunday school class that is attempting to extract itself from the regular forms and to reach out, would you be willing to come to our Sunday school class Sunday morning? Adano: I&rsquo;m glad to do that, my plane don&rsquo;t leave until the Eastern last flight at night time. I&rsquo;ve made all possible preparations. 1:30 Audience: Does anybody have a program that would conflict with that, we have our class at 9:50 in the morning and I have mentioned this sort of thing and be glad to have everybody come for that matter you know but it&rsquo;s over at (inaudible) Chapel and we&rsquo;d be glad to come and get you. Where are you staying, right here? Adano: Jesus Christ put it this way He says, &ldquo;The foxes have holes and the birds have nests&hellip;&rdquo; Audience: The Son of Man. Adano: The S-U-N not the S-O-N you know. You cannot confine the light of God, when you understand what it means it&rsquo;s impossible to confine the light of God. You can confine a human body to one spot but you can&rsquo;t confine the light of God in one spot. Let&rsquo;s have a little meditation because this is what is very important, through this you get a glimpse of what it is. Audience: We have to go unfortunately and so we&rsquo;ll be with you Sunday morning if not sooner. Could you take just five minutes to meditate, you see it&rsquo;s alright if you leave during the meditation, we accept that, but I would say it&rsquo;s no sense of just coming and not participating. Well we&rsquo;ll have to catch me pretty soon after an all night meditation. Audience: What time will you start that all night meditation? Adano: I usually start about 10 p.m right up to dawn then after that we take a break and we can go to the next one. Audience: So you don&rsquo;t really need sleep. Adano: Over the years of the meditative life, the body conquers that but in the early stages you do sleep, don&rsquo;t let no one fool you. See the result of what tranquility and inner consciousness, it&rsquo;s not something accomplished overnight, it is a long steady process to see it work out but the result of having accomplished it and to what it&rsquo;s leading to because it is re-establishing, it&rsquo;s a re-establishment of the basic science that the great Masters have given their life to, you see that is the thing. Audience: When Jesus prayed did He pray or did He really meditate? Adano: Always. Audience: Always? Adano: Always meditated and one of the things&hellip; Audience: Where did they get this thing, &ldquo;Our Father who art in heaven&rdquo; business? Adano: Well He gave that too, that&rsquo;s a formula. You see the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is not just a prayer, when they ask Him &ldquo;teach us how to pray&rdquo; and then He gave them a formula of how to live in the prayer and they thought it was a prayer but if you break the prayer down scientifically with a more objective approach but not the theological approach to the thing and you begin to see objectively word for word on the connecting exclamation marks and their real perspective then you&rsquo;ll start to see that this is science, it&rsquo;s a whole science of how to live. Ok, you can leave ahead of time that&rsquo;s no problem because these are all veteran meditators. Now try and keep the spine straight, this is important because since the human body is the temple of God, there is a sense of reverence for the altar in any temple let alone in the altar within the human body. Now the altar within the human body is the spine, now all the forces emanate from there outwardly and return back there and are stored there and then gradually rises to the brain and back into the cosmos. God is within us as the pure joy and bliss and light and sound. Now Jesus gave a method how to meditate by stating &ldquo;If the eyes are single, the body is full of light&rdquo; that is to close the eyes now but don&rsquo;t fall asleep, that is don&rsquo;t become in a state of subconsciousness, try to always be conscious because this is a personal vigil between you and God and there is no sense of shame if you don&rsquo;t make any progress right away, in fact this is surrender through love and love is a thing that attracts this light down and get it and in fact it makes it brighter, the mere love for it. That&rsquo;s why He said &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind and heart and Soul and neighbor as self.&rdquo; As you look inside at the point between the eyebrow you&rsquo;ll see a little radiance in there and this radiance takes on three basic colors: gold, blue, and white representing the trinity. Now within the right ear you have to listen, within the right ear, not the left because the left is a downward pull and the energy is discharging, in the right side the energy is recharging or regenerating you or refreshing you. As Jesus would say &ldquo;You come unto Me, you come unto the self, and this self will refresh you.&rdquo; Listen in the right ear and as you listen you will connect to a very high pitch electronic whine, this is the cosmic vibration or the sound of the atoms in motion, this sound pulls you up into the Divine Consciousness. Now the mind has a tendency to drift, this is natural because it was constructed that way and if it drifts to an idea concerning the past, by its own nature it will generate frustration. Now if the mind drifts to an idea concerning the future, by the same principle it will generate anxiety, yet if the mind would stay in the present now, the total I AM, yet within this I AM this same principle the mind is forced to release the tranquility or the serenity or the peace that passes all understanding, this is by natural law, the sense of identity is restored now. So with the deepest love coming up from within one&rsquo;s entire being, feel, watch, listen. 1:40 OM OM OM OM OM (chanting multiple times with entire group). OM Shanti, OM Shalom, Peace. (Meditation). Heavenly Father, Divine Mother, beloved Jesus, beloved Gurus, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, Paramhansaji, Master Charan Singh, Kirpal Singh, Satya Sai Baba, the Saints and Sages of all religions, we bow to Thee all. May Thy love shine on the sanctuary of our devotion that we may be able to awaken this love in all hearts. Adonai Elohim, Adonai Echad, Adonai Elohim, Adonai Echad. Hear O Israel Lord Thy God is one. Hear O Man the reality is IS-ness and it is all one within us. (Meditation). Slowly open the eyes, try to feel your identity in the environment, try to hold on to the peaceful effects of tranquility. Now those who want to go deeper can do so from now on, those who want to leave it&rsquo;s quite all right, I&rsquo;m not trying to chase you away but I know everyone has obligations. Going deeper only means that the eyes are the windows of the Soul and to accelerate this just open and shut it a few times and then merge back inside. Thank you. 1:50 Now let us go a little deeper. Centering the consciousness at the top of the skull to those who have certain mantras or holy names that they will attune to, now they can broadcast from the top of the skull, mentally think of the holy name and broadcast it, Ram, Christ, Gurus or the holy Sanskrit word Soham which means &ldquo;I am He, I and My Father are one.&rdquo; Broadcasting from the top of the skull but don&rsquo;t move the tongue, send it out in waves. (Meditation). Beloved Masters we thank Thee for manifesting their presence, the healing current that&rsquo;s flowing into us. (Meditation). 2:00 Slowly open the eyes and try to hold onto the peace. Thank you. Audience: Walk around, stretch, let me bring you something to drink. I&rsquo;ll make some coffee. Adano: I&rsquo;ll have some coffee. Audience: (Chatter). Adano: The strength is in &ldquo;Meekly wait.&rdquo; The strength is in persistence, endurance, calmness, and patience, these are the strength. (Inaudible). You see the thing is the individual who comes to the spiritual path and accepts (inaudible) his own psychological make-up, now we cannot judge one individual&rsquo;s psychological make-up for the whole (inaudible). Each one of us has his own individual psychological make-up and a good many of us are not coming to spirituality because (inaudible), they are coming because it is the only way to escape householder, they don&rsquo;t want to live, they want to vegetate. This is a psychological weakness in us, this is not a strength. You see we are not really gaining strength by running from things and this is the first peculiar part of our nature. Then we think, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this, I don&rsquo;t want to do that&rdquo; (inaudible), not actually true, you are getting weaker. You are getting strong by being freed FOR activity, for involvement. You meditate and your meditation is sometimes full of tension and then you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting results&rdquo; (inaudible). Story about the pig and the lama (but mostly inaudible)</p>
<h2 id="1968---part-2-intuition">1968 - Part 2 Intuition</h2>
<p>Adano68_08_2IntuitionQ1RRNW6 - So the pig says to the Lama, &ldquo;Teach me how to find tranquility, inner tranquility.&rdquo; So the Lama says, &ldquo;Assume the yoga posture and then close your eyes and try to visualize the universe and the infinity of the universe.&rdquo; Well the pig sat down and close his eyes and after awhile he says, &ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting any tranquility.&rdquo; He says after getting the instructions, this is the remark the pig made, &ldquo;Is that all I got to do you know, sit down and close my eyes. Is that how I&rsquo;m going to get this tranquility, close my eyes and visualize?&rdquo; So the Lama says, &ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t see anything, all I can think of is New Year&rsquo;s Eve and parties,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s all the pig can see in his mind. So the Lama picked up a mallet and hit him on the head with it and knocked him out cold. When he hit him on the head he saw all the stars in the universe and he said, &ldquo;I am the light of the universe,&rdquo; and then the Lama says, &ldquo;Some people are hard to tranquilize inside. Sometimes I hit them hard on the head.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s a very true thing with most of us when we start meditating you see, the mind, this is normal. Audience: So many times it happens that people would say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m resigned to God&rsquo;s will&rdquo; and then we end up doing things (inaudible). Adano: Well you see for instance I said Divine Mother willing this is the thing, not my will because I (inaudible). Now I meditate but I never asked Divine Mother where I should go or what I should do because the first thing the scriptures of all religions point out, &ldquo;Do not pray like the Gentiles&rdquo; like the gentle folk, those who have no understanding you see, the uninformed, do not pray like the uninformed who is praying for things. Now learn to pray by seeking first the kingdom of God which is within you and all these things will be added unto you, that is try to sit down and gather in meditational practice and gather in this consciousness and let it calm you down&hellip; (laughter at something somebody brought Adano). Audience: That&rsquo;s alright I&rsquo;m glad it happened this way, I&rsquo;m just real thrilled. Adano: Now you don&rsquo;t ask for yourself because this is normal, we do these things before we come into the meditative life, this is normal for us to do that. After we get in the meditative life, we&rsquo;re trying to feel ourself through the actions around us, through the things that are synchronizing our life, he says &ldquo;Well this is God&rsquo;s will or my will&rdquo; which is which? God&rsquo;s will is so well organized that when the experience comes along and you get involved, the information that is being brought out you see why it is God&rsquo;s will that you had to be there at that particular time for that particular experience, otherwise it&rsquo;s not, and the scripture says, &ldquo;Your needs are fulfilled&rdquo; not the wants and this is a lesson we got to learn to live with, this is something we have to learn, this is a natural process. As we learn to live with the need, then that doesn&rsquo;t say we don&rsquo;t develop our abilities, that doesn&rsquo;t say we mustn&rsquo;t develop our artistic nature, our talents, because this is evolution. We have to gather this consciousness and work with it but meditation is to help you to go to these things with a better sense of attitude, a different frame of mind, not as a sort of a defeatist attitude, always think if you&rsquo;re fortunate to be the one little sperm that became a human being, you&rsquo;re going to be fortunate enough to make the grade with what you attempt to do because this is already implanted in the sperm in the very genes for success. Now if you defeat that, then you&rsquo;re destroying the very life principle in yourself, that&rsquo;s why the Master says the worst thing for a spiritual person is doubt, They wouldn&rsquo;t condem any other behavior pattern in a person but the one particular thing that They have tremendous&hellip; They don&rsquo;t want to see in a person is a sense of doubt. If you don&rsquo;t believe alright but don&rsquo;t doubt, it&rsquo;s better to say I don&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t believe, but don&rsquo;t doubt, don&rsquo;t doubt that these things can happen, better to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in it&rdquo; but to say &ldquo;I doubt these things do exist&rdquo; you know then doubt already sets up a sort of defeated attitude in the individual. Audience: Also this building of faith I mean it should be not only don&rsquo;t have doubt but continue to build up a stronger and stronger belief or a faith in the inherent whatever you call beingness of your nature or God because it is in the measure of your faith that anything is done unto you or that anything happens. Adano: Well you see in this way how you increase your successive abilities or what you say the spiritual forces that warrant you to be at the right place for the right experience is by recognizing the actual fact of success by becoming the human being. If you do not recognize this fact, this physical fact of having succeeded to become a human being, then this sense of success don&rsquo;t exist for you, the sense of failure exists for you, you see. The Jewish people are very very success minded but their sense of success because they have accepted the fact that they have achieved human birth, they have achieved, they will overcome and in yoga this is the first thing. Martin Luther&rsquo;s banner talk you know, &ldquo;we will overcome,&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s not saying he&rsquo;s overcome because he knew that he succeeded to become a human being from the sperm, the Yogis know this. Therefore there is no impossible thing for a spiritual Master, He bases his power to overcome karma or the laws of nature where other men fail, He bases on the actual fact that He became a human being over all the teeming masses that were struggling to get to that ovum, He was the one, He was the one that made it. So the one that made it is the one that has a sense of strength you see. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Right because the part is this, life and death, life and the accomplishment of becoming human form, taking on human form and working as a God principle. 0:10 Look how many are discarded and if you look through a microscope, when you see it so the one that did succeed was the one that is what you say &ldquo;chosen,&rdquo; Brahman Brahma has chosen. Now Abraham says &ldquo;I have chosen these people, these are the chosen people of God.&rdquo; All right look at it in a different context, the Creative Intelligence has chosen to intercede for the one sperm to succeed so they say in the scriptures &ldquo;Happy is the man who has gained human birth for it is the will of God and His grace that made it possible&rdquo; but we don&rsquo;t understand how that&hellip; we read it as poetry, now let us read it as objective science and as religion and see how it is true. The sperm was the thing that did it, the motility of that the action, that drive, that will, the Peter then the John the devotion of having come out now as human form to realize yourself. You see the symbols are there already, bring out the nature of you, you realize now why you have to succeed, why you do succeed? In spite of yourself you want to succeed. Audience: You&rsquo;ve already succeeded. Adano: Right! Once you have bitten by the bug of success or accomplishment, this sense of accomplishment, but when you defeat it by feeling that you&rsquo;re not succeeded then you are weakening the thing, you are weakening this principle. Audience: There is no striving from then on once there is a realization that I am Soul, there is only a&hellip; I say there&rsquo;s only a being each day. Adano: Yeah. Audience: But that realization is much more than a mental acceptance. Well look at it this way, you can only see the growth in others, you cannot see it in yourself, it&rsquo;s very hard to see the growth in yourself, why? Because the sense of unworthiness creeps in because you are flesh, you are form, therefore the sense of unworthiness&hellip; Audience: Comes from&hellip; Adano: If you realize that you are&hellip; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Wait a minute, until you accept worthiness as divine grace permitting you to be a human being, not until you accept this fact that it was the divine grace that permitted you to be a human being, to be the only sperm to succeed, then is worthiness a real thing for you, that you are worthy for everything that cometh your way. It&rsquo;s your worth, you are worth it, you are entitled to it. I have a friend, you know he calls himself a Jewish Texan, he says, &ldquo;I am entitled to be a Texan because I was born in Israel.&rdquo; Audience (laughing) Now that&rsquo;s real thinking. Adano: And he came from Israel, born in Israel, he lives in Texas, he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m entitled to be a Texan.&rdquo; Audience: It also helps us to recognize the worthiness of every other person. Adano: Right, now you understand why they say, &ldquo;to love neighbor as self.&rdquo; You cannot love neighbor as self in the true sense of the word unless you accept the worthiness of self. Where is the worthiness of self? If you constantly defeat yourself of being worthy of being a being or being a channel or an expression of God, then you have defeated your neighbor too. You first got to evaluate your own worth, you got to evaluate your own worth that you are worthy to have the grace of Light to descend and make you succeed at this critical point of truth which is the sperm into human form into God form. Audience: Well when you say succeed, what are you trying to succeed at? What are you trying to be worthy of other than&hellip;? Adano: God seeks within Himself to achieve the full realization or express Himself as full realization in human form. That&rsquo;s why He slowed down and created human form, in order to worship Himself. So He Himself, this Creative Intelligence, seeks to establish worthiness of His own Self in form. Otherwise, what do we need a form, what does God need a form to worship Himself? The form will never admit to itself that it is worthy of the divine intervention. Audience: The form doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; Adano: Its ego will say, &ldquo;I am more important&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not worthiness, &ldquo;I am more superior&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not worthiness. The ego can be very puffed up but the ego talking is self pride, that&rsquo;s not worthiness, you understand? Worthiness is a humility, not a sense of defeatism, there&rsquo;s no sense of being defeated when you think you are worthy of something or you are entitled to something, it is a sense of strength that permits you to apply yourself without any sense of doubt or backsliding. Audience: Well it&rsquo;s a complete realization of who you are, what you know that you are, say God in manifestation, you wouldn&rsquo;t say that God is not worth of succeeding. So you have to admit you are&hellip; Adano: Right, ok, you ask, &ldquo;How much is this worth?&rdquo; So we say maybe ten cents, fifteen cents, we don&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t worth anything, it&rsquo;s worth something, right? Now, in human consciousness, I mean beingness, we are worth something too, now we have to establish what is the something we are worth. Now, the more complicated, the more better material this object is made from, the greater is the worth, now in consciousness it&rsquo;s the same thing we place a higher worth, or sense of value, on the realized Master&rsquo;s presence than the person who is not realized. Don&rsquo;t we do that? Now when two people come to work for you, don&rsquo;t you put a higher sense of value on the more experienced individuals than the less ones? Why? Because it&rsquo;s the application of one to the other, the involvement of responsibility of one for the other. It&rsquo;s like the three men had three talons given to them, one had five, one had two, or whatever it is, and they all went out and applied. Well what did the third one do with his? He hid it so what was it worth to him then? Was their any worthiness in him? If he himself don&rsquo;t consider himself worthy enough to apply himself, the being who gave him or the person who gave him something, isn&rsquo;t it likely to take it back from him? You&rsquo;re wasting the thing, in other words whatever you are worth in whatever you estimate yourself, the highest estimate you place on yourself is Soul, you see? 0:20 If you place yourself the highest estimate, it is not ego now, that you are Soul, then you&rsquo;re going to realize it in this life form, the effort is not wasted, the effort is going to come off now. You&rsquo;re going to see it because every action that you perform now is will of God, Guru. Though the Guru or the contact with the Gurus, you are doing Their will, which is you are meditating to discover yourself, you&rsquo;re accepting the challenge. Now that doesn&rsquo;t say if somebody&rsquo;s sick you don&rsquo;t pray for them but what is the will of God too in that person&rsquo;s life? The will of God is that Man should lift himself up but that man&rsquo;s karma may prevent him from lifting himself up or prevent him&hellip; Audience: Well this brings up a question in my mind Adano and that is of course it was brought on by this thing that we read in the book that Louise had over here the other night when Krishnamurti said something about people who go around trying to help are a curse. Sometimes I wonder if we don&rsquo;t seemingly interfere in trying to help another because the very thing that he has is is really a result of his own actions, thought, or his own being misfiring somewhere and how else can he learn except through the discomfort that&rsquo;s brought on through that. If you if you take away the thing that is giving him this discomfort, if you take it away too easily will he ever begin to think in terms of what the cause is or who he is or what might have brought this on. I don&rsquo;t know whether I make myself clear. It isn&rsquo;t that you don&rsquo;t want to be helpful to people but if taking that problem away from them, have you really helped them? Adano: Sometimes the greatest help is not to help. Audience: Well that&rsquo;s what I wondered. Adano: And this is what they call the Saints sometimes They appear to be cold potatoes, but They are not cold potatoes in the sense that They don&rsquo;t give no physical, tangible expression of help to satisfy the five senses or the ego but They do help by re-evaluating Themselves within you as Themselves, They try to see Themselves in you. Now when I look at you, I&rsquo;m trying to see Adano or my consciousness, I&rsquo;m trying to see the consciousness of God, what is the God in Myrtle? It&rsquo;s the life power which is in me, can I recognize this life, how it vibrates, how it scintillates, what is coming coming out from it, which is self, because this self is the audible life current you see? Now to say to you, &ldquo;do this, do that,&rdquo; this is only a mechanical action, it&rsquo;s like saying to myself, &ldquo;I should do this, I should do that,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a mechanical action but if I don&rsquo;t say anything, when I try to picture you in totalness, picturing myself in totalness too, then in totalness or in oneness I see myself as harmony, then sooner or later your mechanism starts to take on the sense of harmony. Audience: Where there&rsquo;s harmony, there isn&rsquo;t going to be illness or anything else because that is the outcome of the wholeness. Adano: Then after you reap this harvest of harmony in yourself you gotta share it, you gotta share it because you can&rsquo;t use it all yourself. Audience: Yeah but how do you share it? Adano: Only when you get to a certain degree of development or realization that you share this, you can pray for them, meditate for them, and turn the thing over to the Masters. Audience: Well that&rsquo;s what I can say, you don&rsquo;t deliberately go out and interfere in their life. Adano: No but then you see the Masters also give you some of the workload to carry, you got to carry some of the workload, They don&rsquo;t force you into it right away. For instance there was a king who was ill, son was ill, and he prayed that the illness go to him and the son became well, that&rsquo;s a workload, and that&rsquo;s how They work out, many Masters work out the karma of friends or disciples in Their bodies. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: To say to somebody (inaudible), this is duality too, it&rsquo;s a duality because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not helping, by not saying anything, by saying I&rsquo;ll think of it or I&rsquo;ll meditate upon it, I&rsquo;ll pray in it, now we have three ways to pray in which we can confuse ourselves. One we pray that the person gets well but we are confused to the extent that they need to be well and we are confused to the extent that we think all prayers are so important that the Divine Intelligence has got to intercede to make them well. You see the pride and the ego that crept in there, right away because we assume right away that all prayers are so important to create an issue or intercede in that person&rsquo;s life. Now this is the thing now, that&rsquo;s one approach that we have that this is a weakness too, how do we step aside from that weakness? We meditate again in ourselves but we have to pass through that to recognize it and we got to be exposed to it otherwise we don&rsquo;t know that we have done that, we don&rsquo;t know we were victims of doing such a thing. We all have done it, everyone has done it&hellip; Audience: But it is the action experiencing that thing that makes you wise enough to know or realize what it is? Adano: Right because after you&rsquo;ve prayed so many times that way and you see the repercussions of having think you have helped and then you really didn&rsquo;t help, then you you take stock of yourself, &ldquo;Do I really help or should I help or who helped or what is being helped?&rdquo; If God has slowed down and become this person and this person has a malfunction of thinking and is reaping the rewards of his malfunction of thinking and turns to you and we were both puffed up egos assumed that our so-called spirituality is gonna correct this thing, we have made fools, really ain&rsquo;t doing anything, we&rsquo;re deluding ourselves. The thing is to say to the person after you realize what is been involved, &ldquo;I will meditate on it&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna try and heal you&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask God to heal you&rdquo; you understand? Because then again you think you have some kind of pull with this unseen force which he doesn&rsquo;t think he has a pull, you understand? Then right away he develops a sense of inferiority complex and you develop the superiority complex. Audience: Which is the same thing. Adano: Now if you say you&rsquo;ll meditate, you try to see within yourself the truth of the thing, &ldquo;Here I am a self, pure energy, and that other person is pure energy, that other person is light, it&rsquo;s consciousness&rdquo; and two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another. Then how is it going to be possible for you not to love one another, if that is consciousness and that is light and that is energy and your consciousness and they are both equal, you see the equality of the thing now, both means equal and the same thing. Now then if you feel harmony then you don&rsquo;t pray for harmony in that person, you harmonize consciousness with consciousness, you know in your consciousness that that person is functioning now in harmony and in consciousness because that person is consciousness and that person is of the same nature, the same substance, the same thing. So you&rsquo;re not interfering no more, you&rsquo;re not taking part or dictating, you are now synchronizing. Audience: Or maintaining a continuous thought of duality. Adano: You&rsquo;re synchronizing, it&rsquo;s a sense of synchronization now, it&rsquo;s an at-one-ment with the thing. 0:30 So that&rsquo;s why the centurion when he came to Jesus, all of a sudden he realized &ldquo;Why should I invite this man why should I ask Him to pray for myself. If You only say the word,&rdquo; you see but saying the word was something tangible he needed to clear up in his mind the sense of oneness and Jesus seeing that said, &ldquo;Never in this whole land have I seen such faith but go, it&rsquo;s alright, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; What is done? Did Jesus do something or it is done because the man has come to the realization that there is a oneness between him and all life that his son is still himself and he&rsquo;s the progenitor of his son and he sees the connecting link of all things with the mere fact that he stopped asking the man to come to the house? You understand he woke up to the realization that the whole thing was oneness, this is taking place within the man finally and because it&rsquo;s taking place within him finally from that deeper realm of his nature, Jesus is affirming it, Jesus is sort of putting us out of a sense of confirmation to that understanding, it&rsquo;s done. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done unto you who relies now that the whole thing is a total oneness, that is yourself who is being healed in the child, it is your real self, you only see him as a child because you are the father from a physical standpoint. Now you are seeing it not as a Father because you stopped wanting to invite Me into the house as a physical being.&rdquo; You stop the the process of of delusion, you see, the mental block, you automatically recognize the mental block that this is not a child no more, this is self, and I am not a Teacher coming now to come into the house to heal this man, this is self again talking. The man got an illumination, an enlightenment to self the moment he recognized that he didn&rsquo;t have to go and ask the man to come in now. You know he says when he met Him, he says &ldquo;my son&rdquo; and Jesus says He don&rsquo;t heal people who don&rsquo;t belong to His church you know or His nationality but he says, &ldquo;If you only say the word Sir,&rdquo; that this is the enlightenment, it&rsquo;s an enlightenment to oneness in self. Audience: This is also the enlightenment when you come into this realization that I am Soul, not that I have one but that I am Soul and being the Soul I am one with the Soul nature of the universe. Adano: Yes, the thing is this, you have to feel. See once you start feeling there is a pulling back from all the five senses, all through the nerves, from the leg, ears, and everthing, there&rsquo;s a sense of pulling, the energies seem to pull back and stops in certain portions of your body. It stops right here on the top of your skull and the forehead and you feel a sense of like it&rsquo;s numb. In other words all the energies have returned back to us a fulcrum, a firing point, you understand, which is the real you. When you close your eyes you are pulling back into yourself, you are pulling back into the core of yourself. Now the real core of yourself is not triggering off anything, the real core of yourself is devotion which is the natural love, the natural love of being yourself, the natural love of sitting right where you are and being content. Now this doesn&rsquo;t say that you sit down there and have no compassion or anything, not get involved in worldly activities, Yukteswar just knocked that out of Yogananda&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get drunk&rdquo; in this core of identity, don&rsquo;t get drunk in this blissful feeling without partaking in material activity because this is a world that is built that way. Only people who are made out of marble don&rsquo;t act, we&rsquo;re made out of flesh, we have to act. Audience: To act out that realization in all of living. Adano: The thing is it is not running away or sitting down, let&rsquo;s solve the problem, it&rsquo;s getting inside first and feeling the strength from inside in order to go outside with it, this is something that is different, it is something that takes a while to adjust to. Audience: Well you&rsquo;d have to experience it little by little I think. Adano: Yes, peace don&rsquo;t come like something phew and you suddenly transform, it is a gradual saturation of your cells. You know the yogi or the spiritual man in the early part of his life or the very start of his meditative life begins to feel the presence of God or the Divine Spiritual Force as a pressure around the neck and the head in the forehead and temples like a slight pulsating. This is to give him indication or to make him aware of the fact that he is linked up now with the divine principles of his nature and that he should be more aware and try not to break that link, not try to disturb the link, try to understand how it functions and try to live with it. Now Yogananda says &ldquo;Gradually as you learn to live with this vibration or this presence, you begin to do your daily duties with a sense of inner calmness.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why the meditation is no good just to sit down and close the eyes and feel a little bliss, the best of it is to open the eyes and to try to take it. That&rsquo;s why they say open your eyes, don&rsquo;t move, and try to hold on to this inner synchronization or this inner synchronized peace, this inner contemplative condition, this inner softness, this inner strength, and walk out in the material realm or objective realm taking it in stride. Now you apply yourself in art, music, anything but then when you apply yourself, you apply yourself from that frame of reference, from that particular sense of attitude that you are calm, collective, and you have deeper&hellip; actors and actresses are forced more than normal people to react faster under those conditions. It takes a great deal of mental conditioning to shift from one emotional nature to another, let alone if you can have the devotional nature you see. Imagine Jerry Lewis playing a roman priest, which is going to be a comedian priest but then if you can take on the serious nature, still it&rsquo;s gesture, mood and gesture, attitude again you see, the person has to condition himself and go in, he has to live the part. Now this is the thing as I say the living bible is one little expression to live the part of the (inaudible), spiritual person is no different than any other person, only the id was there and 99% of it was perspiration, you see. More and more as you get into yourself, there are three distinct things that take place. One the calmness, the tenderness, and the invisible strength of conviction, this is something you begin to realize sooner or later over the years of meditative life. 0:40 Audience: When you say strength, is that strength to fulfill, the strength of will? Adano: No, not strength of will, strength of acceptance, you accept yourself, not strength to dominate or push out on others. You are here, you are you, in other words each one of us is a unique petal in the flower. Now you know the peculiar thing is this, the petal in the flower is connected to the next petal, you ever look at a flower before the the petals separate? When the bud is closed up and you were up open it, before you start tearing petal off from petal there&rsquo;s a slight connecting link from one to the other. Audience: From one of petal to the other. Adano: Yeah there is a connection, that connection is the unity of our life frequency in all of us, we are all connected equally within to God. The sense of identity is the individual petal when it is pulled apart by the pressure of the air to express its own identity and this is what we are when we seem to want to communicate our nature to others, it gives us a sense of identity. The moment you want to communicate to me you disconnect from everything that you are connected to and you project you but if you don&rsquo;t want to communicate to me then you are connected back to everything and everything around you. You feel your sense of oneness now in a room, try to communicate now, you have to disconnect. Audience: Well it&rsquo;s almost imperceptible. Adano: That is so minute and yet it is happening in us and through the meditation this is what makes us realize now that love is not to be in love or to be loved or to crave love, love is this connecting link, this minute principle that holds us together that you can now feel yourself and as you feel yourself along with it. Now when you try to communicate you do not step away from the oneness of it, you see before you try to communicate you have to disconnect yourself to communicate but in the pure love there is no disconnection to communicate to no one, the love is, you see, it&rsquo;s going to the thing. Audience: You were mentioning something earlier in the evening about having&hellip; my brain&rsquo;s kind of fuzzy right now&hellip; (inaudible, then laughter). Adano: Kate has colored it and it looks marvelous the one that she colored, it looks beautiful in color, the pink pig and the nice Lama, he&rsquo;s all dressed up and he&rsquo;s sitting down (inaudible). It is interesting to see because it describes many things about us in meditation, what we are actually doing in meditation. The fellow who wrote it had to experience meditation or the thing that went through meditation. I&rsquo;ll tell you a little story, there&rsquo;s a friend of mine she studied with Paramahansa Yogananda and after the Master passed away you know, she came out from the ashram to live outside on her own, she was fairly developed and she wanted to attend a Zen Buddhist meditation. Well she went to the meditation that night with her daughter and they&rsquo;re all sitting down meditating and the master walks around and all of a sudden he takes his fist and gives her a whack on the head and tell her to get up, that was the end of the meditation. Audience: I would think so (laughter). Adano: See said to me, &ldquo;Adano, I saw stars, planets, lights, and colors, everything.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Have you gone back?&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;Oh, not to that type of meditation.&rdquo; I told her, &ldquo;This is what you were asking for, you were asking to see the inner lights&rdquo; (laughter) and where are the inner lights? Out of tissue, bone, is congealed energy, light, and it&rsquo;s not going to release itself except by a shock. Now tremendous concentration takes a while for this thing to give up it&rsquo;s electrical vibration, yet if you put your fingers over the eyes like this, you begin to see the entire infinity, the whole universe like if you went to 2001 to see the picture, the whole thing is right there but this takes (inaudible). Now she wasn&rsquo;t willing to do all that so he took his fist and gave her a whack on the head and she saw it and he said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of your meditation.&rdquo; The thing is meditation is trying to make you watch inside and collect these energies to the central part of your being in order for your mind to be clear visioned, seer, you know clairvoyant. Audience: Can you force that through will? Adano: There is no forcing, there&rsquo;s no will, this is strictly spending the time&hellip; Audience: But it had to be concentrated. Adano: Yeah, you know thinking is one of the hardest things, to think, to feel and watch, this is vigil, it&rsquo;s a vigil to stay there and watch for a long time, to see this inner light and now don&rsquo;t count it in terms of overnight activity because this thing can take months, years, this is a growing thing because it assumes you&rsquo;re alive, you&rsquo;re growing. So it takes a while for it to get up but then all during that period there is a sense of joy, this is the important thing, now you can see all the lights and hear all the wondrous sounds but if you don&rsquo;t have the joy, you have nothing. They cannot take away the joy from inside you know, now Master Jesus would say, &ldquo;If heaven is a place where we are going to go to be joyful and you never experience one bit of it in the physical body while you&rsquo;re in this Earth, so what good did God give you a body for?&rdquo; What did you want to ask Him for a body? If you can&rsquo;t experience it here and you were in the realm of joy, the angels are supposed to be joyful and yet they are envious of you who got a body. So is their joy real to them? Are they really experiencing the joy they&rsquo;re talking about? The joy we&rsquo;re talking about is the fact that you can feel it in these tissues, that it can come out and you can consciously experience a flow of this light to be conscious of this thing. 0:50 Now unconscious joy is sleep, we all have that every day. The scientist says what portion of our life we sleep it away? A great portion of it and that&rsquo;s unconscious joy. Now in the spiritual life that&rsquo;s joy but still you got no way to be conscious of it to say that it&rsquo;s there inside. So when you&rsquo;re in the physical body this joy is here in meditation which is intuitive unless it&rsquo;s in the spiritual realm or a cosmic realm, yet the greater joy is this with the eyes open, action, the greater joy is here still, the active life is the greater joy. This is why they say Brahma the Creator creates, Vishnu the Preserver maintains, but the Creator&rsquo;s joy is great, the Preserver&rsquo;s joy is greater, but the greatest joy is the renovator, the remodeler, the person who is tearing down and building up with a new expression, he&rsquo;s getting greater joy, he&rsquo;s getting the greatest joy. The greatest joy is always to set up something fresh, to reactivate it. Audience: You&rsquo;re getting into debatable ground now. (Laughter). Adano: Debatable ground? Audience: It just begins to smack of that returned son and I&rsquo;ve always still had a feeling that the boy that stayed home and took care of things was just as deserving as the one that went out and lived wild and came back and was accepted and I hadn&rsquo;t quite been able to deal with that yet. Adano: Well you see that is a symbolism that the Master Jesus used you see, a prodigal son. There are two lights in us, there&rsquo;s a wayward light that moves out through the five senses through Ida and there&rsquo;s a stable light the stays within us called Pingala, it doesn&rsquo;t go nowhere, Ida goes all the time. Now therefore it goes down into our basic nature, down in the pigsty, it grovels in the pigsty, it becomes degenerate, discharges so it&rsquo;s like a prodigal child, that&rsquo;s why they call it prodigal, the pull of the one light going this way. When that light reaches a point of total discharge, not complete, total, that light sees it&rsquo;s too weak now because it&rsquo;s drained out, it&rsquo;s depending on the midbrain or the solar plexus to activate phenomena, to participate in phenomena to survive, therefore it comes to its senses. It comes to its senses, this is what it says, &ldquo;He came back to his sense,&rdquo; he came to himself, it returns back here now trying to find out why this content has crept in, this illusion has crept in. So it tries to go back now but on the return up now, the moment this sense of disillusion, this sense of recrimination, sense of making amends, a remodification begins in the human being, intuition starts moving forward, not reason. It&rsquo;s the strangest thing, reason don&rsquo;t come back moving down toward the person who wants to make amends, intuition, devotional love starts moving out, the person who wants to make amends. Why? Reason would interfere and prevent him from being humble, a person who wants to make amends starts to be humble, his nature becomes humble, he&rsquo;s trying to be honest with himself for the first time and reason has no place there now, reason would only destroy anything and reason is Pingala coming back again because the other one says to himself, &ldquo;Why should I give up my&hellip; why should this current now start taking and pushing back this side now, why does this other one gotta come back in? Why did not intuition come down and help me here and give me a chance to go further in get past this thousand petal lotus.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t, it moves forward when Ida starts pulling back, when the degenerative energy starts pulling back, the disillusion starts remaking itself or making amends, the intuition starts coming down and reaching it out and encouraging it back, this is what we call the regenerative life. It begins to pull back now, it gives it encouragement, it meets it halfway, the intuitive nature pulls it back for the first time. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes, this is what you call going through RAM, you&rsquo;re going through the resistance, the adjustment, the mutations of consciousness, and the molding or patterns of consciousness and eventually you go through what is called saturation, lag, and then our night of the Soul and then recurrence, that is a new expansion of mind and Soul and force in your mechanism. Audience: And you always expand a little more. Adano: Every time, you never go backwards in this process because it&rsquo;s there you see. Now Masters have pointed out that you can use mantras or Gurus and the holy names or the holy prophets, they are the ones that can help you to go inside further in. That&rsquo;s why you should be able to meditate and call upon these holy ones to help you move inside. Now don&rsquo;t think for one moment they say move inside you&rsquo;re gonna fly away out of your mechanism, go flying all over the joint, moving inside also is again a process of clearing up in the mind ideas of behavior and understanding how this behavior can now transfer itself to outward action. Most of us go into ourselves, we make decisions within ourselves but we don&rsquo;t take it out into outward action, we don&rsquo;t see the peace in outward action, there is no peace. So what have we got? Now if the peace that passes all understanding is the thing that the Saints seem to bestow upon us and when you meet the Saint what does he got to bestow? Does he bestow miracles? He&rsquo;s praying all the time, well if he&rsquo;s praying he may be repeating a mantra or the name of God or he may be immersed into the outward feelings&hellip; (noise in microphone) I must have busted your cord here, okay (more noise) &hellip;it&rsquo;s this inner refinement that is occurring inside of you you see. Audience: Adano you spoke of the Master, the name of the Master helping you in meditation to come through or to understand, is this actually something that is coming from the Master, is it he in some way personally conscious of this falling upon him? Adano: No, you have a living Master. Audience: I&rsquo;m assuming this is a Master (inaudible). Adano: The living Master is one you have that you know is living in the body, that is working from the realm of matter to matter because you are matter and Babaji is a living Master, he&rsquo;s working from that realm to you in your meditative practices. Yukteswar and all these men have reached the resurrected body but then you are gonna always be in doubt as to where you stand in worthiness of a resurrected body to your physical body. Now in terms of the human body that&rsquo;s way the expression, &ldquo;the need of a living Master&rdquo; because form, Babaji is in this form, Charan Singh and all these men are in the living form, they are linking you through the meditative process to the levels of consciousness within yourself, they are involved in this as a physical thing. Now whenever you meet them you know then, they they show you themselves that they can take you to this level, they pull you to this level because they are still in their physical form you see. Now John had to do this for Jesus, Jesus knew this as a reality, so when you meditate, the name of the Master is a link. Now let me show you another way of saying it. All right you have a TV set in the room, there are so many channels to which you can turn to, you have to pre-select what channel you want to tune in on and the program is coming and it&rsquo;s being picked up because of previous association. Now you may not know what program is on tonight but you&rsquo;re playing just that particular channel. In the case of the living Masters&hellip; Audience: (talking to tape recorder) Sorry to cut this off folks but this will be continued on the other side if you will turn the tape over I think I&rsquo;m going to backtrack just a few words to give you the connection</p>
<h2 id="1968---part-3-intuition">1968 - Part 3 Intuition</h2>
<p>Adano68_08_3IntuitionQ1RRNW6 - Audience: (talking to tape recorder) Well this is continued from Friday night, Adano Ley&rsquo;s talk continued from Friday night. This will take up perhaps another quarter or a third of this side of the tape. This is a side two by the way but after this talk is concluded then there will follow on the balance of the tape all of the talk that he gave the following night on Saturday night. I&rsquo;m speaking of days in August 1968 in Dallas Texas. Adano: In the case of the living Masters and I don&rsquo;t say that the un-living ones are not important, each one is in its own category and they&rsquo;re all important. What you&rsquo;re trying to establish in the part of meditation is a living contact helps us to understand the non-living contact better because in the non-living contact we are liable to develop illusion, you understand? Now in the living contact, the living contact will vouch for anything that has occurred within you, to him he can say &ldquo;I was there&rdquo; at that date and he can even tell you things about yourself what happened at that particular time if he was there or not, you understand, he will be able to tell you that, so you know the living Master has this capacity, he is total awareness. Now you&rsquo;re tuning in to these Masters in the living form for instruction, now their instruction is to show you the secret of creation, how the law of life works in you, and they tell you that you listen in the right ear for this current. Now in the ashrams many of the disciples from America who went to some of these ashrams, they claim that one morning they were sitting down with a group of students who were meditating and everyone says &ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you hear the Bani? Let&rsquo;s go have a half hour with the Bani&rdquo; and the American disciples didn&rsquo;t know what these people were talking about. Here they come all the way from America, spend all their money, and here&rsquo;s a few people sitting down closing the eyes and they&rsquo;re talking of Bani. Audience: What&rsquo;s Bani? Adano: The cosmic sound. Don&rsquo;t you hear the cosmic sound? So the people didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about and there&rsquo;s one man says, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the bell?&rdquo; The American student, &ldquo;What bell you&rsquo;re talking about? I come here to meditate on the Guru.&rdquo; The man looked at him and says, &ldquo;What do you think the Guru is?&rdquo; God is sound, He only took the form of the Guru to make you conscious of the sound but you gotta sit down and meditate to hear it.&rdquo; Now they said they had a half hour listening to the sound and this was their meditation for that morning. Now one man said to one of the American disciples, &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve been initiated now, no matter what you do before you leave this room you&rsquo;re bound to hear the Bani&rdquo; and the American disciple was kind of confused, you see he didn&rsquo;t understand what the word Bani meant. He says &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bound to hear that bell sooner or later tolling, you&rsquo;re gonna hear it no matter where you are, how long it takes you, it is the will of the Divine for you to hear it, that you sit down and wherever you are and listen to hear this cosmic sound and you will hear this bell ringing and when you hear it, you&rsquo;ll link into it.&rdquo; Now this was a meditation that these people all of a sudden were shocked into, all of a sudden they realized that well this meditation has more than what they expected, they were going into a deeper sense of responsibility in the meditation. It was not just sit back and look at the Guru, try to find a Guru only, they&rsquo;re trying to think of the Guru and because they think of the Guru, the Guru is a means for preventing the mind from drifting so that they would listen. Now when Ananda Moi give you initiation, did he not give you certain techniques to hear the Om technique and the press on the eyes to see the light? Now he initiates and he&rsquo;s gone but he&rsquo;s not going to do those techniques for us, the techniques is still the thing we have to do each one of us, we still got to do like that&hellip; (gap in tape) gone any place you know. In other words their ability to foment or the ability to come up again or sprout up again is diminished and as they diminish more and more by your meditative observation or meditative vigilance, then you can apply your consciousness in the physical realm, this is the strength that you&rsquo;re getting inside from yourself, you start to see now the tenderness, the joy, the compassion, and the love is flowing now, you realize you have been there all the time. Now you realize now that you have to synchronize with it more, you have to feel for it more. Audience: It&rsquo;s more of an effort than you at first think it is. Adano: Well the Masters don&rsquo;t want to scare you when you start you know, otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do this thing you know. The price or what is it? The pearl&hellip; Audience: The pearl of great price. Adano: The pearl of great price is worth its weight in gold? Well the pearl of great joy&hellip; Audience: &hellip;you have to strive for it. Adano: of great conscious joy is worth its weight in silence, put it that way. Now hail to the jewel in the lotus (inaudible) Om Mani Padme Hum, that what it means, hail to the jewel in the lotus, hail to the light within the third eye, hail that he can see the light and hear the sound, this is what it is, this is what you&rsquo;re trying to do. Greater than the light is the sound because the sound is responsible for the light. &ldquo;I am OM. I am OM. OM. OM&rdquo; I am light. You know Parmahansa Yogananda and all the great Saints didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I am light.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I am OM. I am the cosmic vibration. I am the Word.&rdquo; So &ldquo;I am that I am,&rdquo; you begin to realize what Moses was experiencing. He experienced the oneness of the Word as pure consciousness which is himself and this was his sound, he got to hear this sound, this high-pitched electronic frequency and it breaks into a melody and it&rsquo;s there all the time and it pulls you. It pulls you up, it doesn&rsquo;t pull you down, it pulls you away from Ida which is the discharging force of the body, into Pingala the higher force in the body, and it stabilizes here and it stays there all the time. While it stays there there&rsquo;s a slight tension here all the time, there&rsquo;s a slight little pull, like somebody stretch you like a fish hook. In other words there&rsquo;s no desire to go down, that doesn&rsquo;t say you don&rsquo;t get involved with physical things but the involvement in the physical things don&rsquo;t have repercussions no more, there&rsquo;s a sense of freedom from them. Audience: Involved, a sense of involvement (inaudible). Adano: That&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s no pressure there. Audience: The only thing now is to experience it. Adano: Well you&rsquo;re experiencing it, you know why? Everyone is experiencing it but the thing is not every one of us have developed the capacity to hold on to it. You know it&rsquo;s like an electrical cord, no in fact you ever seen one of those power guns or power hammer? Audience: Yeah like you mean they go into pavement with? Adano: Right, you know how much strength it takes to hold one of them when that thing starts to really work? Now you give it to somebody who can&rsquo;t hold on to, you know what happens? 0:10 Audience: Jumps out of their hands? Adano: No, you have no more toes. (Laughter). You won&rsquo;t have no more toes. It will make a mess of his feet. If he can&rsquo;t hold the thing, it will go right on his toes. There were lots of them when it first came out, people could not control it. Alright, look at it this way, you know you ride a Brahma bull, how long can you hold on to a Brahma bull to ride it? Not too long, it throws you or a bucking bronco, it throws you. Well it&rsquo;s the same thing, the sense of holding on to the inner current is patience that&rsquo;s why you start to meditate and you start to feel forced to bliss, that&rsquo;s why I say &ldquo;feel the bliss, come out, get adjusted, then go back again and go deeper.&rdquo; Now going deeper is going into a deeper sense of hearing, these are things I want to re-clarify in your mind in meditation. Start out, you are in a state of relaxation, to achieve the first degree of relaxation, so you got it in levels now, you&rsquo;re trying to achieve the first degree of relaxation. Now the second thing is you&rsquo;re trying to achieve a deeper sense of hearing. Now the third level you&rsquo;re trying to achieve a deeper sense of feeling because you really don&rsquo;t feel deep enough until you get past the first two levels where you feel the whole body becomes numb and you feel that there is no sense of identity in body and people say &ldquo;well my foot went dead&rdquo; but how is this energy gonna go up or is it going to be part of it? But this comes in steps. My sister here who is sleeping see, now it&rsquo;s like the Russian computer says, &ldquo;The booze is good but the meat stinks,&rdquo; the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak. That&rsquo;s how it was translated you see, strange. The consciousness goes to a first level of peace, get this level first in meditation. Now as you hit this first level and you feel this peace don&rsquo;t stop, open your eyes, hold it, look out again into the world, don&rsquo;t move around and I have a friend, his name is Sonny, he says &ldquo;Boy is it good to be conscious, thank God I&rsquo;m alive and I&rsquo;m peaceful now, I don&rsquo;t have to hit somebody the head&rdquo; and he closes his eyes and goes back in. Then the next level is a deeper sense of hearing, more intently on the right side, then you open your eyes and look out. &ldquo;He says now, I wish I was a musician, I&rsquo;d write down all what I just heard&rdquo; then he closes his eyes and go back in and start to feel, then he open his eyes and come out, then he don&rsquo;t talk no more. So I ask him what happened, he says, &ldquo;who wants to talk, shut up!&rdquo; (Laughter) And this was his way of describing what was happening to himself you know. The first time he felt the peace and he opened his eyes, he&rsquo;s thankful he&rsquo;s peaceful, he doesn&rsquo;t have the anxiety he&rsquo;s gonna strike nobody you know. The pressure of these things are gone and as he closes in now and he go back deeper in, the acute hearing, he&rsquo;s starting started hearing different frequencies, he wish he was a musician to write these notes down because you&rsquo;re hearing these things, you want to put down musical notes. The third stage was that the feeling of this deeper feeling, who wants to talk after you can feel? Everything is like this you know, you&rsquo;re feeling this condition like what Walt Whitman says, &ldquo;When I begin to describe what I&rsquo;m feeling my tongue refuse to move&rdquo; because you see the tongue feels you see. You see why it can&rsquo;t talk no more, because it&rsquo;s feeling exactly what (inaudible) everything is feeling. So it&rsquo;s a good way of describing it, after you&rsquo;re feeling it you can&rsquo;t talk, there&rsquo;s no way you can talk about this thing, the feeling is too great, it&rsquo;s joy. Once you can recognize it as a serenity then you know what you what it is because then from that state you come back into the waking state and start working. Well as I told Arnold I says, &ldquo;You gotta get out and do action, you can&rsquo;t just sit down here all the time and get lost in there.&rdquo; We got to get into action and by action, there&rsquo;s balance, so this is how the balance comes up. Now some people do action because they want to act but they do it as if it was a chore you know, they do it to escape from the inaction, that&rsquo;s a chore, that&rsquo;s not really doing anything, it&rsquo;s still your attitude. Yes another question? Audience: I can see too much work ahead of me. Adano: Let&rsquo;s assess work, what is work? If you do assess it and then you can see why possible there is not so much work as we think it really is. Work is desire plus energy, you must have some motive plus a certain amount of exertion and call it work with the resistance against it because you have to exert yourself against a certain resistance to accomplish it. Now once you realize this is what you&rsquo;re being involved with then it&rsquo;s not such a thing to run from because then you can see now that the daily resistances in the outward life is the key to the accomplishment of strengthening the inner life. The inner life don&rsquo;t get strong without the outward expressions, the inner life only gets sharper or more distinct in observation and outlines and feelings but you still got to apply in a physical sense your nature. You see you can feel joy inside, they become sharper and distinct and more pronounced but you take a two-year-old kid in this room with a lollipop and you got on your nice dress, let&rsquo;s see how much joy you really got when he drop it on you or a little chihuahua comes along and mess up your beautiful rug, out flies all the joy right? See? Audience: Well I&rsquo;ve never been bothered by work, I don&rsquo;t think Myrtle really is either. We do lots of it. Adano: Right, well you see the thing is this, in the meditation as you get deeper into it, this is what I&rsquo;m trying to clarify now, as you get deeper into the meditation you want to hear, its principle of hearing. Now it&rsquo;s over a couple of years I&rsquo;ve been talking about meditation right and we have covered the basic things that were supposed to be covered, how to get into the peaceful state at the start, how to watch, how to listen. Now we want to make these things with more emphasis and with more a result of action from inside now, so it&rsquo;s not how long you meditate now, it&rsquo;s how deep you go into the thing and connect and get that contact and come out and get that strength. Audience: I guess I haven&rsquo;t had that goal in mind and that&rsquo;s why it hasn&rsquo;t happened because I don&rsquo;t hear that sound, I want to see some light sometime, (inaudible) inside of my eyelids but what happens when you hear this sound, there&rsquo;s no voice with it, if it would even come in dots and dashes I might study them, what comes with the sound? 0:20 Adano: There are certain distinct sounds, there&rsquo;s a sound of a bell, it tolls in the four corners of the universe, north, south, east, and west. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You see the bell is in the heart center, it tolls on the astral realm, and it&rsquo;s the bell of the Angelus, this is where the Roman people got&hellip; Now great Masters came into the Roman church as popes to set up these principles, the bell was made, then there is the conch or the shell, the blowing of the ocean sound, then there is the flute, Krishna flute, then there is the harp, these are distinct sounds. The harp which David played but forget David playing his harp, let&rsquo;s say David achieved the realm of the harp consciousness in his chakra, he awakened that chakra with the harp and he had that power, he had that spiritual power from that center. Now Joshua achieved the trumpet and they said he blew the trumpet and the walls came tumbling down, the walls of ignorance came tumbling down when he heard the trumpet of that chakra opened up, that particular chakra opened up and he heard that sound, that vibration, certain things are dissolved for each one of these sounds in the chakra, you know what I&rsquo;m saying? Now the walls of ignorance were dissolved when that particular chakra opened up in Joshua. Now they are here already and they are already established and you have to listen to the thing. Now, then there is the flute or trumpet then there is the harp, then there&rsquo;s the bee, the buzzing of the bee, then there is the bell, you hear a bell and in some ashrams where they tell you to sit down and meditate and just try to hear the bell, they don&rsquo;t even give you no other instruction than to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come here now so long, you&rsquo;ve been practicing meditation, now try to experience the meditation in a deeper realm now, sit down and try to hear the bell. Audience: Is that imaginative or is it actual? Adano: It&rsquo;s actual. Audience: Oh good, I&rsquo;ll hear them all from now on then. Adano: It&rsquo;s actual, it&rsquo;s not imaginative because when challenging initiates, I know one boy as soon as he was initiated by a disciple of Charan Singh, heard the bell all around him and he thought it was imagination and for days that bell was tolling all around him that he told his friend and his friend says, &ldquo;You talk about hearing it, I&rsquo;m outside I&rsquo;m hearing it&rdquo; and his friend is not even a disciple, he hears the bell tolling in the room. Audience: So then these sounds do open the chakras. Adano: They are the result of the chakras opening, the sound is the result of the chakra opening up. When the chakra opens, it gives off these sounds you see, the sound is coming out from the chakra itself and it brings within a certain siddhi, you know a siddhi, a power. It is a psychic force that is transformed to you and you are capable of using it. Now the Masters don&rsquo;t say you should use it, they say learn to control it till the time comes and all of them are opened up, then these forces are within you, it&rsquo;s a natural thing. So if you hear, that&rsquo;s when Jesus says, &ldquo;My time has not yet come,&rdquo; again he had to hear this bonnie, hear the sound inside going on and have to know that these forces were there, these are your tools to work with. Now it&rsquo;s a bee, it&rsquo;s a flute, it&rsquo;s a harp, it&rsquo;s a bell, it&rsquo;s a thunderclap. Now you ever seen pictures of the Buddha with a thunderbolt in his hand? Now there is a friend of mine, she was initiated by Kirpal Singh and I visited her one day and I saw on her altar the thunderbolt and I said, &ldquo;You got it back,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;yeah it took me a long time&rdquo; and that was the end of the conversation. The thunderbolt was an actual substance made from particular materials teleported back to her from (inaudible) after she reached that development and she is pretty well developed, she doesn&rsquo;t go around telling anybody, but this is something she had got back after she achieved her meditation and it&rsquo;s on her alter where she meditates. Now as I said before there&rsquo;s a bee. Audience: Is that the lowest one? Adano: What, the bee? Yeah, the bee is the lowest. The bee, the harp, the flute, the bell, the thunderbolt or thunder, flash of lightning, and the ocean. Now you look at any of the paintings and you will see there&rsquo;s a thunderbolt in one hand with a conch, there&rsquo;s a little swirl of light. Audience: I remember in mythology Zeus had a thunderbolt but he threw them around. Adano: When the siddhi of the throat is opened up, the thunderbolt is there, this is a force from here. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t this connected with the power of speech? Adano: Thundar is not speech! Well thunder is speech, the thunderbolt. &ldquo;He threw his power through the thunder, the force of the sound.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s call thunder, sound, speech, it&rsquo;s the same thing that&rsquo;s the symbol but when the siddhi is opened, this force is there, it materializes as a actual thunderbolt and if you see what it looks like it&rsquo;s a fantastic thing. Audience: (Inaudible) No no no no no, the thunderbolt is shaped like a dumbbell, it&rsquo;s a short little thing it&rsquo;s shaped like a dumbbell as it looks like a metallic stone, it glistens and one of them weighs about let&rsquo;s say anywhere within the vicinity of four and a half pounds and it&rsquo;s smooth and cold and this one I saw in this woman&rsquo;s house and you can touch it, you feel the vibrations and it will pull your consciousness up there and I sit down in meditation, you can touch it and it&rsquo;ll pull you, it&rsquo;s not from this realm, it&rsquo;s brought from another realm, it&rsquo;s a manifestation from another realm and this is something she had achieved and she had it on our altar. Now it is there, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that, all the disciples who have ever gone any way into themselves, these are things that are given to them because they earn that from their past lives and they see these things in themselves. So we&rsquo;re talking of something that is existing not in imagination but it&rsquo;s an actual thing that exists, they are there you see. The chakras exist as actual things and the forces that are there, when we&rsquo;re coming back, we&rsquo;re going back to the fact that a Master, after he connects you to it, he makes you practice meditation now so that you can work this thing, you got to meditate, you still got to do these things, you see. The initiation is to connect you, the technique is for you to work with, in other words I teach you how to write but you still gotta buy paper and pencils to write with. 0:30 What&rsquo;s good if you learn to write when you don&rsquo;t have the tools to write it with? Audience: Or if you learn to write and don&rsquo;t write. Adano: It&rsquo;s the same thing, that is to say after you&rsquo;re initiated you don&rsquo;t meditate no more, it&rsquo;s the same thing. Now after you&rsquo;re initiated you&rsquo;re making the contact of understanding where the current is located in yourself, then you still have to do the actual thing and doing the actual thing comes easy from then on because you know what you&rsquo;re supposed to do, you see. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No the thing you saw in the Space Odyssey, that Shiva Lingam, it&rsquo;s an obelisk, you ever see Shiva Lingam in India? It&rsquo;s an oblong object and Kubrick only made it a big one, it&rsquo;s a symbol of regenerative life. Audience: It&rsquo;s just a symbol. Adano: Well no&hellip; Audience: It&rsquo;s a powerhouse. Adano: It&rsquo;s a mineral that is not of this Earth, it&rsquo;s called Spatum, it doesn&rsquo;t come from this Earth, you will not find on this Earth. He just photographed something to indicate it. You see it is known by archaeological research is that the shiva lingam is the one of the oldest possible relic that Man could have ever designed, it is not possible to say that it was a piece of odd stone that just dropped out, it is too humanistic in design to say that it was not the human hand that had to mold it in some form or other. This thing has the indication of human intelligence, of a higher intelligence, so Kubrick took the idea and expounded upon it and put it in the 2001 as THE symbol of the regenerative life, here is where life begins to regenerate itself, in other words move onwards. You see the monkey was a vegetarian and he did like this, he ate and then he was chased away from his waterhole by his fellow monkeys then one morning after living in fear and in caves he woke up hearing this celestial sound all around and outside he saw this obelisk, like an oblong thing standing there, like a monolith which was a representation of shiva lingam but Kubrick, he just expanded the thing make it look gigantic, it&rsquo;s the same design, same shape, and the monkey after looking at it, he eventually was impressed and he went to touch it and when he touch it, waves of consciousness seem to vibrate into him. In other words it triggers off life, it&rsquo;s a symbol of life because it&rsquo;s very reproductive or process of production going on, improvement goes on, this life principle, the regenerative life and he reached out and then in this moment he started to think, if you want to call it think, the first action of collective movement. So he saw a skeleton of a tapir and he tried to hold something, you know this is the first indication of human evolution now and this one reached to touch this one in the primates. This part in the primate is up here, this won&rsquo;t reach across to here. You look at the primate and you see this never reaches to touch this, this is this is slightly higher here than here, so it cannot reach across. Now let&rsquo;s say Kubrick shortened it by photography to jump time but this creature reached out and made this movement to this, so Man came to do this eventually from the first evolutionary jump from this condition to this one. Now when you do this, that gives you the power of doing this, which gives you the power doing this, forming a fist. See the fist is what makes the difference in evolution in the primate and the first Man form, we have nothing else to indicate there was a jump in evolution, not his brain, it was a jump of one of these indicators you know, to reach and close. So what did he do? Clasp for something and then it started to wield it, what is normal for us to do with this? So by hammering out our destiny with our fist, we move forward, so he whacked and whacked and whacked and it&rsquo;s so unusual not to see how natural it was, after he was whacking from this position he got upright because every time he got stronger in applying the force. So it was well presented in how this process of standing up came from a squatting position. Now and he changed his diet, he changed his environment, he took back what was rightfully his. Now this is a process of survival too and he pushed back and then eventually the frontiers of environment moves to what we call modern Man or industrial Man. Now then in the picture they said that the monolith was found on the moon or maybe it come from Jupiter, that would be unimportant where it come from, this planet it&rsquo;s only four and a half billion years old, it&rsquo;s a fantastic thing when you think of it that we are naive enough to think that we&rsquo;re only human beings in the whole universe, you understand? When every scripture has said, &ldquo;Come let us make Man in our own image, male and female create He them&rdquo; that means organized life came into existence in a male and female process but in no language can you find the word Man except in Sanskrit that would indicate organization, manas is mind in Sanskrit. Now there&rsquo;s no other language you&rsquo;re going to find this word that is so closely related to indicate us as Man. So if manas is mind what really was it saying? &ldquo;Come let us set up organized mind in tissue form, male and female,&rdquo; the whole universe had to have it. So organized tissue form which is mind in an organized way, we are looking at an organized tissue form in mind. So Sanskrit already tells us here&rsquo;s what the thing is, male and female you see, so if the Masters all say that this universe here is highly populated not only in the physical realm, in the astral realm and the causal realm, boy I tell you Adam and Eve had a long battle to go if they were the only two people, you see how we&rsquo;re not understanding this. Adam and Eve is ida and pingala in ourselves you see, this is the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life is in us, the roots are in the head and the nerves come down this way in the trunk. Now when God slowed down or pure consciousness slow down into energy and energy into matter, it has to stop someplace in the matter, now if it stopped in Man or manas, organized tissue that is capable of expressing consciousness, then where in this tissue did it stop? What gives this tissue a superiority over other expressions of tissue? The spine, there is either vertebrate or invertebrate organized life, the most important organized life are the vertebrates, the invertebrate ones that means those without spines or vertebrae, those without don&rsquo;t have any sense of organization. 0:40 Those with the spine have the sense of organization, those are the ones that push forward and all the evolutionary movement continue. Now Masters have said that in this mechanism with this spinal axis, which is an altar, God also gave one more important thing, a thousand petal lotus in the midbrain, this is where the seat of the life energy is supposed to rest now. It slows down from there gradually becoming the body form then stopping at the point in the body form, it has to stop at a point in the body, if this is the root of the tree where you draw the sap from when it takes energy, the tree has to stop at some point from the roots. Now if you look at a tree or a seed shooting its way out, all the roots are where the seed is supposed to be then the tree comes up, there comes a point where the tree stops growing and it&rsquo;s just spreading. At the head of the tree where it stops, this is where the dominant energy is. Now in Man where this has to stop, it stops at the base of the spine, the dormant energy stopped at the base of the spine but the energy became dormant at the base of the spine, it was slowing down, the energy was active which is God is active and it&rsquo;s slowing down and becoming dormant in the base of the spine. It became dormant there, that doesn&rsquo;t say it lost its ability to be creative, it&rsquo;s dormant, that doesn&rsquo;t say it loses the ability to be creative. Now this mechanism is devised with two brains, the actual real brain and the pseudobrain, which you call the solar plexus, now we could call this some other kind of plexus, why did they specifically what they call this thing a solar plexus? The thing is the solar plexus wasn&rsquo;t taken from Latin you know, you gotta go back to Sanskrit, why in the Sanskrit language you find this word &ldquo;solar plexus&rdquo; here or solar chakra this chakra here is solar. Now to what do we refer to solar to? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: The sun, sun center. Ectoplasm, psychic phenomena, and all extrasensory phenomena have their seat in the midbrain because here is the crossover point between the energies, your energies cross over this way from your spinal system. Now if all your nodes were connected this way, you know you couldn&rsquo;t live, because it will back up on itself, the hydraulic pressures will push back and your body will burst apart, so everything is crossed over as an axis. That&rsquo;s why they draw a figure eight now to represent the infinity of life, now what is figure eight? It&rsquo;s a circle put this way. Now because it&rsquo;s put this way, it has a cross pressure and it&rsquo;s a principle of hydraulic playing back upon itself. So we find now this thing is right in here, it crosses right here, right here, now Ida goes this way and Pingala goes the other way. Now in Man or Manas, that is in organized tissue, male or female, or the Garden of Eden is another symbology, there is two forces existing there, Adam which is reason and Eve which is feeling. Now feeling is like a two-edged sword, that&rsquo;s why in the Book of Revelation it was referred to as a two-edged sword. Eve and if if you spell Eve, it&rsquo;s two &ldquo;E&rdquo; with a &ldquo;V&rdquo; in the middle and the &ldquo;V&rdquo; is the vortex, &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the two forms of energy pulling both ways. If you take it right in the way it is and we say Adam, put a hyphen between the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the &ldquo;D&rdquo; what have we got? What is a dam? Audience: It&rsquo;s a blockage. Adano: It&rsquo;s something that holds back a force. Now we say it&rsquo;s reason, now reason is the only force we know that can hold back or react with a sense of indifference, unblock things, and prevent any experience and if you say &ldquo;that man is very unreasonable&rdquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to reason, this is a function within the mechanism that is blocking. So this is reason in Man, it&rsquo;s an Adam force, it&rsquo;s a dam, it&rsquo;s a force that dams up the flow of the energies that comes in from the medulla and flow down. Now here is Eve, it&rsquo;s not a woman, it&rsquo;s a principle which represents emotion and devotion, it&rsquo;s feeling, so Eve is feeling and Adam is reason. Now this feeling has two functions, it has an emotional function or a downward pull via the five senses, it has a devotional pull or an upward pull via the withdrawal of the senses, so what are you going to say? The Masters say when they come to teach you to meditate on God, bring all your feelings and all your awareness, all your feelings and your awareness to the point between the eyebrow. So if my feelings are here, when I want to get to the eyebrow I gotta stop this and go here, you see how fast this thing switch back and get back there? This is exactly what we&rsquo;ve done. When you pull away from here, you&rsquo;re here now this energy is pulling down all the time and it pulls up. Now in this door right here, from the day feeling moved down, now we say that Man fall, what fell? Was it, reason fell, was it the feeling fell, or what fell? Audience: Consciousness. Adano: Consciousness, right. The moment consciousness refused to &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not.&rdquo; Here is the longest process of meditation and here is the thing we got to get covered, cosmic consciousness is in here already and to get it is to watch with vigil, that&rsquo;s why they say the practice of vigil to watch and Jesus says &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t get excited, don&rsquo;t get over anxious, don&rsquo;t be like Eve, don&rsquo;t be that feeling that is emotional, don&rsquo;t drop down into a psychic phenomenons, don&rsquo;t go down into the midbrain or the solar plexus, which is an imitator of the real brain. Now &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not&rdquo; and by the natural pull, cosmic consciousness is forced to descend. Now The Autobiography says this, not me there are many spiritual&hellip; by the natural inevitability of your love and devotion, cosmic consciousness descends upon the devotee, see? So this is a natural thing already established for God to come into Man for this thing to descend in Man. Now but he can&rsquo;t wait, he&rsquo;s impatient, he can&rsquo;t spend that time, he figures here is too long, so it slips down and when it slips down to this midbrain to practice with this midbrain because here it promises all the phenomena that he&rsquo;s gonna get and the current starts to move this way now because where? It&rsquo;s moving to the dormant life energy God that is dormant in the spine, which is supposed to have the power of creation. The power creation is at the base of the spine and it&rsquo;s moving towards that creative nature but remember he said it became dormant there, it slowed down and became dormant it didn&rsquo;t stop, it slowed down. 0:50 Now, but it got tricked, feeling in the form of emotion gets tricked when it moves to the creative force in the dormant stage. The creative force, they call this the tree of knowledge, this is the tree it was called, the tree of knowledge of good and evil but it didn&rsquo;t say it was a tree of knowledge of life and death. There&rsquo;s a big difference if you understand what is being said about the thing, this was a tree of knowledge of good and evil, this is a tree of knowledge concerning how to live and how not to live, but it wasn&rsquo;t a tree of life and death, yet within this tree there is the principle of life and death. So the the dormant energy is down here and it has the creative energy, it&rsquo;s what they call the &ldquo;fruit,&rdquo; the creative energy, the energy moves down here but this creative energy had the power of life over death. Now when it found out it didn&rsquo;t have, it found out that it couldn&rsquo;t get back up here because the moment it lost its ability to go to meditate, it resorted to psychic phenomena and right here now the Divine Intelligence place what you call Michael the Archangel, it placed will right there to block you. Audience: It placed what? Adano: Will, will blocks feeling and reason from experiencing pure consciousness, ego will. Now and it said Adam Kadmon is redeemed again in Christ but who is Christ and who&rsquo;s Adam Kadmon? Now reason can only be redeemed by intuition so if you remember what Omar Khayam says, &ldquo;I have made a brave carouse, I have divorced old barren reason&rdquo; that&rsquo;s &ldquo;old barren reason&rdquo; is Adam now because you don&rsquo;t know nothing there can come from it, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve taken the daughter of wine to spouse.&rdquo; The daughter of wine is spirit, because wine is spirit, not the actual drinking wine, the spiritual force and &ldquo;the daughter of spirit&rdquo; is intuition, the intuitive nature of our spiritual life or devotional life is what we call the daughter and he has taken, &ldquo;he who?&rdquo; Conscious self has taken now a new approach, a new evaluation of his mechanism for the first time that he no longer relies on this barren reason who is going to be pulled down here by the psychic phenomena to the midbrain, it&rsquo;s going to be pulled back to intuition now and redeem itself. He&rsquo;s going to do Adam Kadmon, you know come back to Jesus, all this means the same thing, Man eventually pulls back to the right side of the brain to Pingala and it is pulled in by listening to the current and he enters the Sushumna canal or the internal canal, which is the stamen of the flower you know the stalk, it pulls right back and goes back up into the crown, the raw flower, the 1000 petal lotus (inaudible), but most of us stopped there and that&rsquo;s not where you&rsquo;re supposed to stop. Audience: We are supposed to stop at the 1000 petal lotus? Adano: No, we just begun now. See when you get to the thousand petal lotus you&rsquo;ve arrived to the Causal Realm, you haven&rsquo;t arrived to the Soul of the Saints where the Saints go, the Saints all go back to Sat, Satloka or Sachkhand, God is Sat, only in Sat the Sanskrit word Sat is where your consciousness must be. See that&rsquo;s why they say it, &ldquo;we go back to Sachkhand,&rdquo; the pure consciousness, see it is devoid of contact now, see and this is where we have to go back. That&rsquo;s why they call it the Sat Purush, it&rsquo;s beyond the thousand petal lotus. Now it is like the bee sitting on a thousand total lotus sipping the nectar out of it instead of just being the thousand petal lotus you know, you come up to be the lotus, you want to be the bee now sipping off the honey of the thousands petal lotus, this is the Sachkhand. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes the Kundalini Shakti, you see Kundalini Shakti is not sex force. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It is the same thing, the energy comes back up, it stops descending down. See the dormant energy is there and instead of it descending down constantly from Ida, it starts ascending now and it&rsquo;s in the ascending, it is cold, it&rsquo;s not hot, see that&rsquo;s why they say be a cool head, don&rsquo;t be a hot head. You see the energies go back up to the brain and cool the head down and this consciousness&hellip; Gee I keep you folks up late. Audience: (Inaudible). Audience: (voice over) Well that that was just finished was very late at night on Friday August the 9th 1968 and what follows will be a meditation and some instruction given by Adano Ley on Saturday evening August 10 1968. Someone began the discussion by asking a question about the use of the chemical dna. Adano: Welcome to organize the life, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s within the science to organize life but he doesn&rsquo;t say life is we, you know, make a body. The principles are there, the chemicals are there which go to organize life, they have found this, they have found how they organize themselves, how they react upon it, each other, so that life begins to function. Now if you leave a crystal here, it&rsquo;ll grow, crystals grow you know, you can make them grow by light and scientists are slowly learning to find out how to organize the flow of life but the life principle that we&rsquo;re talking about, that to restore a dead man to walk, that&rsquo;s an entire different thing all together. See the life energy comes into the human body through the Medulla Oblongata, which is called the mouth of God. Jesus said &ldquo;Man don&rsquo;t live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God.&rdquo; Now that is to say, organize mind in the form of matter or tissues, flesh called Man, male or female, does not exist strictly or alone by solids and liquids which is bread through the process of assimilation and digestion but by every word, cosmic radiation or lifetrons, a different form of electrons, it&rsquo;s an electron with a different type of frequency which you can tap into with concentration, directly. Man does not live by bread alone but by that word, that cosmic vibration. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s force, it&rsquo;s energy, and unconsciousness you see and it comes in it&rsquo;s called prana but prana is not breath. Most people think prana means breath, prana is not breath, prana is lifetrons, it enters the medulla which is the mouth of God, that is where the sperm met the ovum in electro-vital magnetic contact and started to evolute into human body. 1:00 Now I said there is no such thing as failure since we all became a human body, we have attained success that day, that was the very first experience of success. Now of all the teaming sperms that had to make the grade, this one made it and that one is you. Now we&rsquo;re dealing with a life that is entirely different mentioned that the scientist is working with, he&rsquo;s dealing with chemicals that are built to set organized in crystals but would not make tissue. The DNA can&rsquo;t make tissue, it is a chemical that&rsquo;s in there that organizes itself to give the appearance of living action, movement, it appears to move and multiply but it&rsquo;s not multiplying a cell, it&rsquo;s multiplying crystals and those scientists will tell you he has found how to make life in the form of a cell and build up a body out of it and endow it with consciousness, he has found how to direct the activity, the electrochemical activity, from within the mechanism so that it will stay active, just as much as he found how to perform an operation on the heart and transplant another one and connect them up so we have a flow of blood continuing. Now the Masters are talking of something different, they are talking of the very vital power which slowed down from pure consciousness into a mechanism and became flesh. Now if it was a DNA or an RNA would bring back Lazarus then let&rsquo;s take a pile of them and start making more Lazarus&rsquo;s we can empty the graveyards, you see this is not what we&rsquo;re talking about. The word life is used too loosely, we have to understand what the Masters are talking, we&rsquo;re talking of an audible life stream, it is a current that is constantly flowing down into you. It has a color, since it&rsquo;s light it has a sound, so we are trying to establish in ourselves that from scriptural writing what these Saints were experiencing. John, who wrote the Book of Revelation and his own scriptures, the very first verse of his own scripture he said, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; at the very start of creative activity, pure consciousness was sound, the audible life stream, it&rsquo;s there all the time. Now last night when I was there I asked a question that says, &ldquo;if two clouds hit each other, what do we see or hear first?&rdquo; Audience: You see the light. Adano: You see the light and hear the sound second but the sound was first before the light otherwise how would the light come about if they didn&rsquo;t make contact but because sound travels slower than light, sound is inaudible in relation to that slow movement. Now light travels faster so from light we have what is called an established constant in this universe, that&rsquo;s why the Saints always say, &ldquo;we see the light of God, but it is His Word that made the light possible.&rdquo; It is his whole word, this sound principle, this logos, this OM, this cosmic principle, this audible lifestream that makes it possible. Now John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was this word&rdquo; is this cosmic principle, this cosmic sound, scientists are admitting now that cosmic vibration exists and is the result of the atoms in motion. Now this is ultrasonic and yet it&rsquo;s audible, it can be heard by meditation. Audience: Inwardly, outwardly? Adano: Inwardly, outwardly after you meditate you can hear the cosmic bell ringing all around the room and those who can&rsquo;t hear it because they&rsquo;re not tuned into it but those who can hear it hear it all the time and when you do get into advanced meditation this is what you&rsquo;ve been taught to listen to, to hear the Bonnie, the cosmic sound, to hear it vibrating in the room. Now the bell is important because the bell is synchronized with the heart chakra. Now it pulls you up into the third eye or the Christ eye, &ldquo;when thy eyes are single, the body is full of light,&rdquo; Jesus said that, this is what he means. Within here is a light vibrating from the midbrain and this sound pulls you up back all the time, you don&rsquo;t slip down. Now the Book of Revelation is deeply involved with this and it&rsquo;s all yoga, it&rsquo;s nothing new, it&rsquo;s the science of the Soul, it&rsquo;s only been written in symbology and now for the first time scientific explanation of it, as to what is going on electrically, we can understand it for the first time. It&rsquo;s an atomic principle, in the beginning is this sound, this cosmic audible lifestream and they call it Word, what is word, isn&rsquo;t it sound waves? Now &ldquo;and the Word was with God,&rdquo; what is God that this Word can stay with with Him? God is the total consciousness or pure consciousness and it&rsquo;s a positive principle. Now in the Oriental writings it&rsquo;s called the Satpurush, the eternal existing consciousness, no form because the moment you start giving it form, you start making things out of&hellip; you start making images, &ldquo;thou shalt have no graven image before Me,&rdquo; cosmic self, and this don&rsquo;t have an image, this is light and it is sound. Now the Word was with this cosmic consciousness, or pure awareness, this vibration, and the Word IS God. You see John was specific in delineating each level, first it was the sound to start it, second the sound existed with consciousness, then the sound is total consciousness, you see, and the sound or the Word became flesh, it slowed down from pure consciousness into energy into congealed matter. Audience: Well then it becomes a creative force as well, isn&rsquo;t it? Adano: Right, then God became you, God didn&rsquo;t make you, if He made you then you wanna look for God on some throne. If God became, you&rsquo;ve got to find God in yourself first and this is the first commandment, &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and all these things will be added unto you.&rdquo; Yogananda used to say, &ldquo;everything else in this world can wait but my search for God cannot&rdquo; and what is God, total cosmic consciousness, the cosmic life principle, it&rsquo;s not a person on a throne, it is an awareness that transcends or extracts you from this physical frame and frees you from the pull of ego and frees you from your five senses and its repercussions and from your subconscious memories. Now the Word is there all the time, this sound is there all the time, you can hear there&rsquo;s a high-pitched whine at the start and it stays there all time till it goes higher and higher and still stays at that high-pitched whine. Sometimes it&rsquo;s like standing next to a jet engine taking off, it&rsquo;s the sound of the cosmic motor, the cosmic principle. Now and this sound, this same sound, this pure consciousness slowed down to become flesh, matter, you see, and dwelt in Man in the form of speech. (Adano claps) isn&rsquo;t that in my two hands? What is the clapping of one hand? You know this is a good Zen koan you know, if the clapping of two hands is a noise, what is it clapping on one hand? The rubbing of fingers, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to be, sound again. 1:10 In turn you look at your whole mechanism you&rsquo;re going to find it&rsquo;s sound, hit you on the head you will see light, the light of the cells, the electrical energy within them. Audience: Then you both see and hear the audible light. Adano: Right and then Jesus says, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single directed,&rdquo; see single vision, the word was left out, vision, how can you make two eyes single? Only by focusing them at a point between the eyebrow. The Hindu scripture says, &ldquo;Man must turn his gaze to the Nasika Agram (sp?),&rdquo; the origin of his nose to perceive the light of Brahma. Now where is the origin, not this not the tip, most people says meditate on the tip of your nose, well would be kind of odd to meditate this way or meditate on your navel you know, but this we know is not what the Sages are talking about, the origin of the nose is here, see right here, where it originates. Now we turn the eyes in for the first time and don&rsquo;t fall asleep because when you do, you&rsquo;re going into subconsciousness and our whole journey is super consciousness or total awareness which is God, the Sat Purush, the Divine Donsciousness. Now you can only do this by turning in and watching, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called vigil, to watch, to listen, to feel. Now this is quite a challenge, it&rsquo;s not an easy thing because right there you come up with the first principle &ldquo;Meekly wait and murmur not&rdquo; or as Buddha says now, &ldquo;stay here at the Tisra Til or the (inaudible),&rdquo; the door of inner light and murmur not at the dispensation of God for His wisdom is unbounded and His power is unlimited, sit down there and watch and you will be enlightened, en-light-ened what is light? The brain lights up with the energy for the first time and you see now consciousness, the whole three levels of your being, you see your electrical level which is called the astral level because that&rsquo;s the Greek word astral, star-like, it&rsquo;s light, then you see causal level or Idea level where all the idea principles of the arch-type of the mechanism is set up, then you have to slip out past that into the thousand petal lotus of pure light. So the Buddhas will say, &ldquo;Om Mani Padme Hum,&rdquo; hail to the jewel in the lotus, you got to go past the lotus now, you have to get inside and there see now like the bee, sucking the honey out of the lotus, it is not just to rise up. Now John says, &ldquo;before the throne of God,&rdquo; which is the thousand petal lotus, &ldquo;there were seven golden candle sticks,&rdquo; before the thousand petal lotus we have seven chakras. The same vital energy was here and each one is sealed with an angel, each one has a siddhi, each one has an extra sensory power and it has a positive and a negative pull, you see? Now our endocrine system is the physical counterpart of this electrical principle, which is a electrical counterpart of the idea principle behind it, yet knowing the anatomy of this whole kingdom or this whole temple of the Divine Intelligence, they emphasize one basic thing, love, I can give you the scientific techniques to go inside and experience it but without love you&rsquo;ll have a rough time trying to do it and yet by sheer love it will open itself. Now Yogananda came along, Master Yogananda and he made a chant, his chant was &ldquo;who is in this temple?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the first question, who is in this temple, and &ldquo;all the doors do open by themselves,&rdquo; all the centers are equipped by a time principle to open by themselves, and all the lights go on by themselves. Audience: In other words each one of those chakras has a light that when it is activated, it throws out the light. Adano: Yes it does. Now &ldquo;and darkness like a dark bird flies away,&rdquo; in other words sensory pull to the emotional existence begins to diminish and for the first time you live in an extra sensory nature but you don&rsquo;t try to make God into a three-ring circus by walking around&hellip; You know every miracle that Master Jesus did, He only did it once except two particular ones: food that gave people life to live and death which every man is scared of when he has to go. He performed raising the dead twice and He performed feeding people twice and yet He satisfied their pleasures by giving them wine at one time. He satisfied the blind man, He satisfied the lepers, the illnesses, yet that was not what His intention was, His intention was to teach you the 12 attitudes of behavior which makes it possible for all those things to work for a realized individual. Audience: Did you say 12 attitudes? Adano: The twelve Beatitudes, attitudes of being, behavior, what did you think they were? Be-attitudes, they call them beatitudes, but if you understand what these Masters are talking&hellip; it is an attitude you have to accomplish of behavior. Now one of the attitudes of behavior is &ldquo;the pure in heart see God.&rdquo; Now Master Yogananda used to say, &ldquo;The bible is a book or the scriptures are books which you can read and quote from, but that doesn&rsquo;t make you a bible.&rdquo; Now if you take one verse out of the bible and make it an exemplary life then you become a walking bible because that one verse can perform anything you wanted to do, the miracles of the Masters or the Saints&hellip; Audience: Just one? Adano: Just one verse, make it an example of your life, build your life around that one verse, build your spiritual life around that one verse or build it around one beatitude, let alone try to make it all of them. See if you can build your life around one simple spiritual verse from within, this open doors, you start with one and the rest follows suit because they&rsquo;re all interwoven, they overlap each other. Now I said before &ldquo;Meekly wait and murmur not,&rdquo; this is the most I think the most dynamic one yet, it seems to be the stupidest one as most people would say, &ldquo;Why should I meekly wait and murmur not&rdquo; I have a right to fight back, the real courage is in that one. See because the courage to wait is the courage to admit you can make mistakes and you know no one wants to admit he&rsquo;s made a mistake you know, you always try to find a plausible excuse but you have to be so true with yourself. &ldquo;I did make the mistake.&rdquo; Audience: Well doesn&rsquo;t that statement give absolute blind faith? 1:20 Adano: No, it does not imply blind faith, not for the initiate or a spiritual person, maybe for a religious person or a churchanistic person or an atheistic person but for one who knows what it really means, it&rsquo;s not a blind faith because the first thing in meditation is to believe and not to know is superstition that knocks out your blind faith, you&rsquo;re not told to believe anything in meditation you&rsquo;re told to know in meditation, &ldquo;Be thou still and know that I AM is God.&rdquo; but not &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; is a God or &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; is THE God, &ldquo;Be thou still,&rdquo; bring your consciousness and distill it to the realization that the I AM principle is God Consciousness and when you sense this thing, the first experience is peace and it comes out of you, you see. There is a big difference in the&hellip; &ldquo;to be thou still&rdquo; or to start the process of distilling is still not too murmur, it&rsquo;s to wait and to attune and this is work. No one can say sitting down by this here and with mind wandering away, sooner or later the mind has to stop to a point, it has to come to some point. Now the mind it&rsquo;s natural tendency is to drift, always to drift, ideas, remember I said this mechanism is physical, it&rsquo;s electrical, it&rsquo;s ideational, it drifts to ideas, impressions, ideas concerning the future, ideas concerning the past, ideas concerning the present, before you know it it&rsquo;s always going to flip back and forth. You&rsquo;re never going to say &quot; Well, where am I?&rdquo; Where am I? You know Maharishi of Arunachala used to say, &ldquo;Who am I, what am I, what is the I, where am I? You see the question comes back then the mind has to stop. Now if the mind would drift to an idea concerning the future, automatically it&rsquo;s going to generate anxiety, automatically the mind will generate anxiety, and if the mind would drift back to an idea concerning the past, it starts to get frustration. Now you got past wonderful experience and past not so wonderful experience but even to live in the past with your past experience is still after a while you have to come back to the present where you are and continue what you&rsquo;re doing. So the Sages have said, &ldquo;there is no need for past nor future, there is no present but the eternal now.&rdquo; You see, the eternal now is where you are and eternal now is I AM. This is what we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish from within, the I AM self and allow it to flow into the mechanism and it&rsquo;s easy to do this by love. Now I don&rsquo;t say to be in love with God and Jesus didn&rsquo;t say you must be in love with God, He says, &ldquo;Love the lord thy God with all thy mind, with all your heart and Soul.&rdquo; Audience: What does he mean by love the Lord? Adano: He was not referring to a person you know, he&rsquo;s referring to a principle, a lord of a house&hellip; Audience: It sounds like law, universal law to me. Adano: When he used the word &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; we are referring to the positive principle, the Lord of Life, the actual positive principle of life, it&rsquo;s a Lord unto itself. Now He says, &ldquo;This truth will make you free, freemen all, Lord of yourself.&rdquo; Now if you look into the word &ldquo;lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;lord so and so,&rdquo; this is a title bestowed upon a positive action, this is something that has to come and say well, &ldquo;here this man has the authority or to perform something,&rdquo; the Lord of Life is the authority invested in Man, &ldquo;love the authority of life over your own makeup with all your mind and heart&rdquo; and this authority is justice and in the positive aspect of it. Now in the the opposite aspect negative, and I don&rsquo;t mean bad, it is compassion, it&rsquo;s mercy, it&rsquo;s a polaristic function, so the authority is both justice, compassion, and mercy, so we say this is a divine law, this is the divine justice that runs our life. A judge then assumes this position in a physical form to administer justice with both compassion and mercy and at the same time with penalty and yet this is a principle that the Master Jesus is trying to point out to us that if we can learn to love this Principle, the Supreme Principle, not be in love with It, not to be loved by It, or not to need Its love, these are all conditions of your consciousness. To love is to feel, for the first time you&rsquo;re going to experience a different relationship with yourself, a relationship that frees you from&hellip; Audience: Your complexes (laughter). Adano: But you&rsquo;re not freed from responsibilities, it may free you from your complexes but not from your responsibilities, it frees you for responsibilities, there is why &ldquo;Take up your cross on follow me,&rdquo; that is the counterpart of the statement, you can only be freed for responsibility in God&rsquo;s will, you cannot be freed from responsibility. Now when the Sages speak of Jivan Mukta, freed while living, they are talking of being freed for the responsibilities to live. Now if you&rsquo;re free when you&rsquo;re dead what good is it to you, you can&rsquo;t even take on one single responsibility. Well where is heaven? Now Master Yogananda said if you can&rsquo;t find the portable heaven in this mechanism, you&rsquo;re not going to find it nowhere else because you wouldn&rsquo;t know what it is when you get there, do you understand? The portable heaven is here and Jesus is saying to you, the portable thing is here, the inner consciousness is here already that the Divine Intelligence has done this for us, He has slowed down into this mechanism to allow us to experience it and the goal of life is realization, the realization of this Principle, and the emphasis is still love but this love is still tinged with ego, it still tinged with desire till it breaks away. Now that doesn&rsquo;t make you a cold potato, in fact the love of God is much more tender, it&rsquo;s so far-reaching that there is not one iota of violence in it, violence, it&rsquo;s a feeling that is so involved with tenderness. Now this is not weakness, it&rsquo;s not a female condition, some people say a tenderness&hellip; tenderness is a certain spiritual sensitivity that comes to you that you perceive intuitively the workings of truth around you. 1:30 For the first time you can reach out and look at the deadly snake with compassion and touch it and it won&rsquo;t harm you because you can generate love for it, let alone any wild creature, let alone a raving maniac. It is a love that comes from within, believe me, it comes from within and you can generate it&hellip; Audience: Do you discover it, do you unleash it, when you say generate is it from the idea that you start going or you build it, create it within you? Adano: No no no no you allow it to flow because it is generating from within you by the flow of your mechanism, electrical in nature already. The Divine Intelligence comes down as the id into the electrical energy which makes you breathe and move and stays in the flesh form which makes you act it, so it is a flow from three levels, this is your trinity, it&rsquo;s a flow downwards into you. Audience: All you do is open the door and let it in. Adano: Right so &ldquo;who is in this temple?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the question you see, this this flow is there now. Once you realize that this thing all goes on by itself, you&rsquo;re actually opening up. Now Mataji once told a disciple of Yogananda when Master passed away from the body, he went to India and he wanted to meet Mataji this great Indian Saint, a woman Saint, and the only word she told him, he went to her for spiritual instruction, he spent there for days and they wouldn&rsquo;t talk, for days she was always like this and didn&rsquo;t even know he existed as far as he thought and then she opened her eyes and looked at him, she said in Sanskrit, &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; and the man next to him translated and she closed her eyes and never looked at him no more and she went into her meditation kept on going. Audience: A one word message to him. Adano: Yeah and he spent a week trying to figure out surrender and one day it just dawned upon him what she meant and the flood of this consciousness started pouring down into him. He lived then for about three months then he came back to the States, took up his business, and continued his meditations from within now. He has not run away from the world but he lives within the world and he&rsquo;s not of the world. Audience: Deeply involved in the world&rsquo;s work that he&rsquo;s supposed to do. Adano: But there is no craving of desire for his from an emotional angle, it&rsquo;s all intuitive devotional love, and she freed him with this one instruction, she said &ldquo;surrender,&rdquo; and she said it in Sanskrit you see and the man next to him had to translate it, but it still took him time as a businessman to break through to understand what she meant and when he broke through, he understood. Now this is being a channel, this consciousness flows to you. Audience: Is it the &ldquo;letting go and letting God?&rdquo; Adano: Yes Albert Cliff would make the same statement too, &ldquo;Let go, let God&rdquo; and this is not so easy to tell somebody &ldquo;Let go, let God.&rdquo; You know if I tell you it, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it too, it took me a long time to learn how to do it, so I&rsquo;m no different from the next individual try to learn this thing. Well I&rsquo;m not a Master you know, I&rsquo;m only a disciple learning to discipline my consciousness to be what is the will of the inner conscious. So &ldquo;Let go, let God&rdquo; is not such an easy principle, all truths are simple formulas when they appear, they sound simple when you read about them, attempt them. You know, &ldquo;Be thou still and know that I am God,&rdquo; this is not so easy to do either you see. None of these things are easy to do, they sound so simple yet they are not so easy to do because it is a struggle between the emotional pull of your five senses and the devotional pull of the intuition. The intuition, which is the Soul nature in you too, wants you to go in an unerring way and to experience Divine Law and the Divine Will of being in the right place at the right time for the right experience but your emotional nature don&rsquo;t want you to go that way, your emotional nature wants you to establish the action by your ego and by your will and &ldquo;I must do this, I gotta do this, I want to do this,&rdquo; and before you know it you end up making a mud hole of the whole thing. Audience: In other words you&rsquo;re following an emotional or a pattern from the emotional nature rather than from the God nature that&rsquo;s deep within. Adano: When you say I want to do these things. I only have one thought most of the time, &ldquo;Divine Mother willing,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t go a single place to no place without Divine Mother willing because I know she can organize this world better than I can. You know one time I had a meditation you know and I would start to think about the compassion for people, the suffering and humanity and everything, and I said jee whiz there&rsquo;s not enough I can do to help these people and then the inner consciousness says, &ldquo;If you can do better you try, what I have made, if you think you can do it better then try.&rdquo; I look at it I realize no amount of this conscious from an ego standpoint can alter what Divine Law has set up, it is set up perfectly mathematically accurate for everything like a jigsaw puzzle to fit itself eventually. It&rsquo;s a marvelous thing that&rsquo;s why the Sages say, &ldquo;God has a plan working to the collection of all forces as one, His whole nature&rdquo; and in Oriental philosophy it&rsquo;s mentioned as this whole creation is Lila, it is for the sport of consciousness, it is for the joy of consciousness. If nothing is created for disappointment in consciousness, everything is created for the joy of consciousness even to fall down and let your hat blow away in the wind and you keep running behind it and you can&rsquo;t catch it. What is tragedy for the man who runs behind his hat is humor for the man who is looking at it. Saints successes come from the mistakes of sinners. What is a Saint&rsquo;s success? The mistake of sinners and what is a sinner? A man who is ignorant of himself, this is all. You know one time I was traveling with a friend named Marlow Dawson I don&rsquo;t know if you all know him and he made a wrong turn in the road and he starts to swear away and I says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no wrong turn, that&rsquo;s my success because right around the car you&rsquo;re going to find a store that I&rsquo;m going to buy something and you&rsquo;re not going to find it nowhere else on the highway.&rdquo; He look at me as if I was nuts and around the corner there was this little Mexican store, I saw a little bronze object, and this object when he saw it, he looked at me and he stopped the thing, went in there and I said to the man, &ldquo;How much you want one of those things.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I only got one and I&rsquo;m trying to get rid of it, it&rsquo;s been there so long, I&rsquo;m trying to clean up this place&rdquo; and I know those things sell for about five dollars, he said &ldquo;you can have it for two bucks.&rdquo; So I looked at it, I bought it, and Marlow says, &ldquo;Let me pay for it.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Okay pay for it&rdquo; got in the car and we&rsquo;re driving and he shivering all to himself. I says &ldquo;Stop shivering, you don&rsquo;t have to have guilt complex.&rdquo; This is how Divine Law works, what one man thinks is a mistake turns out for the benefit of Divine Law, it was something we needed to get for meditational practice and it came that way you see. All the little incidents in our lives all add up if we understand what is happening, we begin to see Divine Law happening in our lives. Audience: This is why you shouldn&rsquo;t put up resistance but rather be aware of letting these things add up to your benefits. 1:40 Adano: Yes you see if you take the teachings of Jesus, because most people are exposed to it you know, each event clock it in a 24-hour period, this thing will only add up to one week&rsquo;s activity. Now this man lived three years in ministry, he administered to people for three years of his life and the activity that is mentioned in the scriptures will only add up to about seven days if you compress them every time he had to go to do all these things, they&rsquo;ll add up to about seven days action, yet it is spread out over a period of three years. So we see we&rsquo;ve got a wrong concept as to what these spiritual Masters are doing. we get carried away with the grandeur of the thing and not the real significance of things themselves in our own lives. Well let&rsquo;s have a little meditation. Audience: Adano I was just going to ask you about the story in the Bible of the bride getting married and the bridegroom comes and the virgins with their lamps and so forth. It seems to me to be somewhat related related to some of the things you&rsquo;ve been saying. I don&rsquo;t recall that you&rsquo;ve ever mentioned that particular story in the Bible. Adano: The 10 wise virgins and the 10 unwise ones? You know this has been known as a 10 door house, the body is called a 10 door house in Oriental philosophy, we can count nine doors, where is the tenth door? Right, the tenth door is here, each door is in a state of polarity, that means you got two times ten that&rsquo;s twenty right, ten wise ones ten foolish ones. When people say foolish you know we are preconditioned, so programmed to the environment that&rsquo;s foolish from what we think is fools. Master Jesus is talking of a tremendous law set up but he is using a parable in relation to this truth inside. Now there are pulls from the negative or emotional feel, the foolishness of the ten virgins are inferring your emotional pull from these 10 doors. Now 2 4 6 7 8 9 10, these are all doors or openings, what is a door, is that an opening? And who is this bridegroom gonna come that you gotta have them trim? Intuition or the Christ self because these are sensory actions, these are outlets for the sensory, the emotional pull, the foolish one, the devotional one, the one that&rsquo;s trimming it, pulling back in you see, it&rsquo;s like one of those doors that go this way you know, this is actually what it&rsquo;s referring. The 10 door house, the Lord comes down from His center, and it comes like a thief in the night, they don&rsquo;t tell you when you&rsquo;re going to get cosmic consciousness you know, like last night. They don&rsquo;t tell you when it&rsquo;s going to hit you and knock you off the ground and then you get the experience and come back out of it, the somatic principle or the somatic experience does not tell you, which is the cosmic consciousness, it does not tell you the five senses and your reasoning ability when it&rsquo;s going to hit you, it just comes in and if you&rsquo;re not observant by devotion, that is the 10 wise virgins now, it flies right through the mechanism and it&rsquo;s gone and you missed it, you see. Now if you are observant in the meditative process, it takes care of you to let you have the experience where you would not harm your body, it&rsquo;s like now the bridegroom, it&rsquo;s like the marriage now, it&rsquo;s the joy of having the experience under control in the right environment without any damage to the physical frame and now most of the Saints when they are in meditation they&rsquo;re always in the posture and they&rsquo;re gone you know like that and people are scared, what happened? It came on so far inside. Now there is what they&rsquo;re talking about you see, that you have to watch so that you don&rsquo;t go off and the light descends slowly by itself now, you are alert, that is you are not like this which is the pull outwards, the negative pull you see. The light, the energy means the light now, the energy is not burning out here through the emotions. So what did the ten foolish virgins did to the wise ones where the bridegroom was coming? Didn&rsquo;t they run and ask them for oil, isn&rsquo;t the emotion running to the devotional nature to allow it to experience intuition when emotion is five senses? (Inaudible), they have nothing to work with. Now Omar Khayyam says, &ldquo;I have divorced old barren reason&rdquo; along with the five sensory impressions, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve taken a new wife to spouse,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve taken the daughter of wine to spouse. He has taken wine which means spirit and the daughter which means intuition to spouse, marriage, when the bridegroom comes, when the intuitive nature comes down in Man, the devotional aspect of the ten doors of the mechanism are pulled in to recognize it for the first time that it is descending and it&rsquo;s staying, instead of staying here now, it starts to stay here now, intuitive Man you see, he stays there. Now in intuition, then you don&rsquo;t have to talk you can communicate by the eyes, the thought waves are sent out through the eyes now. All the Masters when they communicate to the disciple, communicate by their eyes to the disciple and they send the energy. Well I remember meeting an engineer boy, a young Hindu that came from Banaras, he lived in Canada and he stayed in the same apartment I was staying and he says he&rsquo;s interested in yoga and he was a kid and he heard of a Yogi that lived way up on the mountain when he was at 12 years of age and he did his best to get to this mountain and he said it was 42 miles from where he lived and when he got to the mountain it was nearly about 1000 feet up in the mountain, he had to climb up. He got up there and he was all bleeding and everything and when he got there he saw three men, the Yogi and his two disciples, and he said to the Yogi, &ldquo;I want to be a disciple, I want to follow the path.&rdquo; He said the Yogi didn&rsquo;t look at him or answer him, he opened his eyes and looked at his two disciples and he closed his eyes and the eldest one walked forward he said, &ldquo;Master says to tell you you&rsquo;re too young, go back home, study to be an engineer, and when you can afford to come back.&rdquo; Audience: All he does is look at him. Adano: And he said, &ldquo;Boy that shook me up, I came down the mountain crying, but then I realized I went back to school&rdquo; and he went and studied hydraulic engineering, mechanical engineering, and he works in (inaudible) now and he just got married not too long ago and he says when he&rsquo;s 40 he&rsquo;s gonna go back, that Master has not gone out of the body yet, but this was his experience with that communication through the eyes. Now he confirmed what I was saying you see and we were talking about different things and he says he saw this with his own experience, that these Masters when they want to communicate from that meditative state they just look at each other and it&rsquo;s transmitted and he saw this you see. 1:50 But this is exactly what we&rsquo;re saying about when the bridegroom cometh with 10 wise virgins, see it&rsquo;s a 10 door house, the positive and the negative, that is the polarities in it which represents the emotional pull which is in the foolish one, you fritter away your life like a fool in your emotional senses, your emotional involvement, so you discharge the energy out of you, you burn up the light in you. Audience: You use it up without accomplishment. Adano: Right, now if you take it inward, back which is called being wise, you nurture it now which is devotion, the energy becomes regenerative instead of discharging and when intuitiveness or divine self, which you call Kutastha Chaitanya or Christ Consciousness or Buddha Nature descends down, the bridegroom cometh, you lock on because then you are aware it&rsquo;s to happen, now you are conscious, and this is also mentioned, &ldquo;the day of the Lord,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s also referred to that moment when Cosmic Consciousness starts descending down, it&rsquo;s also referred to as the Day of the Lord, the day of authority as a wholeness passing through you, the sense of oneness is passing through you, it&rsquo;s coming into you for the first time and this is what the meditation is working to all the time, it&rsquo;s working to that accomplishment. Audience: It&rsquo;s a beautiful parable, I&rsquo;ve never heard it explained that way. Adano: He was a great Master, Master Yogananda says of all the intransient Masters that went this way, he made it possible to understand yoga in simple terminology. Audience: Because he put it in parables of the day. Adano: You see in my own personal life I could not accept Jesus you know, I grew up as a Catholic, I was a little altar boy even attending the priest and still I couldn&rsquo;t accept Jesus and the thing you don&rsquo;t accept is the thing you come back and eat you know. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well I had to go by way of understanding &ldquo;What did Jesus learn or study that he taught?&rdquo; People says he taught Christianity, the question is where did he learn it from? What is Christianity? Now remember he said, &ldquo;Who do men say that I am?&rdquo; And everyone called him a prophet or something and one disciple who was bold enough to say, &ldquo;Thou art Christ, son of the living God.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell it, I didn&rsquo;t say it, you said it, the Father of the consciousness revealed to you something, it revealed to you the intuitive nature.&rdquo; Jesus was a Master of the Science of the Soul, that&rsquo;s why he was called Rabbi, Master. Now the thief on the cross did not call him Rabbi, the thief on the cross addressed him as Master and Master means Guru, Guru means one who lifts up and the Jews were praying for a lift up Savior, lift them up, but in their mind the lift up was to lift them up from the Roman yoke of occupation and he didn&rsquo;t come to give them that, he came to lift them up from their five senses into intuitive living and they didn&rsquo;t want that because that&rsquo;s what they weren&rsquo;t prepared to accept you see and Gurus are passing right through here in this world, nobody wants that, they want a solution to Vietnam right? So the Guru now, they lift up life from the sensory nature to the spiritual nature is not something that we are aware of and Gurus only come to give discipline or attract to them&hellip; Audience: And who wants discipline? Adano: (Laughter) So the twelve men were called disciples, the discipline of living. It is an entirely different communication, an entirely different involvement because it is a freedom while living but it&rsquo;s not a freedom from responsibility because it doesn&rsquo;t make you weak. You know Krishna says to Arjuna, &ldquo;Pick up your bow and arrow and shoot boy. If you don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s what you got to do, look in my mouth and see your enemies dead&rdquo; and He give him the vision. If you only read the Bhagavad-Gita of the Battle of Arjuna and the Pandavas and his kinsmen he says, &ldquo;Why should I kill?&rdquo; We got a bunch of peace movements going on today saying &ldquo;Why should I kill? Why should I join all these things?&rdquo; We are in the Arjuna consciousness too, it does not change, the human nature is not changing, it&rsquo;s still here. So what does the Christ Intelligence says? What does the intuitive nature says, &ldquo;Pick up your bow and fire.&rdquo; In other words take up your cross and follow me, &ldquo;Do your work, do thine allotted task,&rdquo; but at the same time find out that in here is the goal of life because your outward life would illustrate or demonstrate an inward peace. Saints have only one thing to offer us not miracles, you know I used to think why the miracles used to be (inaudible) that&rsquo;s why I said I didn&rsquo;t understand Jesus, I couldn&rsquo;t accept him. It was years after I understand why he taught peace, that peace was the key to it all and that the miracles were absolutely nothing and he said himself, &ldquo;What would benefit you to gain the whole world and lose your Soul?&rdquo; Masters keep telling you, &ldquo;What you want to gain Siddhis for? What do you want to gain psychic powers for? You haven&rsquo;t found peace.&rdquo; You haven&rsquo;t found the inner tranquility, the inner synchronization of your three basic forces, that is the physical body, the electrical body, and the idea body. Now if you synchronize these which are called Integral Yoga or integral unity with your consciousness, then this tranquility, this peace, comes and it takes care, it takes care of all the actions and that&rsquo;s why it seems so difficult at times to want to do it because it&rsquo;s a slow process. Now Sages their experience and their accomplishment cannot be got by drugs or hypnotism believe me, ain&rsquo;t no possible way to get it, to acquire what these Saints have acquired through drugs or hypnotism, there is no possible way, or through psychic phenomena. This inner peace, this intuitive nature that they talk about can only be accomplished by &ldquo;meekly wait, murmur not,&rdquo; love, and it&rsquo;s cheap you don&rsquo;t have to go and spend every day a dollar and a half or three dollars, how much is LSD selling today for? To get some kind of a subconscious experience. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: The boss is placed as a means to give us an experience in how to serve in order to be served. Audience: How to serve in order to be served? Adano: HYou can&rsquo;t be a boss unless you start to take orders from somebody else, you&rsquo;re no boss for yourself yet if you cannot accept orders, you&rsquo;re still an egotist, and Masters will tell you mastery of your human nature is first to learn to accept discipline, that&rsquo;s why they say the military men are the best Yogis and all your Yogis come from the Kshatriya caste, a great percentage of them were warrior kings because the discipline and the responsibility made them great. You know King Janaka was one of the greatest Yogis that ever lived, he was a fully realized Master and you take Saint Francis, he was a soldier, a military Man. Saint Ignatius of Loyola, he was a military man. Some of the great Saints if you go back into their background, you&rsquo;ll find they were adept to this discipline, this organized thinking. Audience: And really they&rsquo;re training as military men because of the strict discipline. Adano: All right and now Christianity has &ldquo;Onward Christian soldiers as if marching onto war&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t it the discipline of living a cosmic life a form of a militaristic way but it&rsquo;s knowing how to kill not to kill. If you know how to kill not to kill, you are free, but if you know how to kill and you kill, then you&rsquo;re not free. Audience: Well is that tantamount to saying killing without emotion or killing without being involved in the killing or what? 2:00 Adano: A Master did not kill but a Master knows what it is to take life, he knows what it to take life, he knows how it is to restore life, but he would not kill. Audience: But he told Arjuna to. Adano: But he didn&rsquo;t kill, you see intuition is the charioteer of the five senses, or the five horses that pulls this chariot called body and this is Krishna and the battleground is the body and the struggle and the goal is self-realization and who is Arjuna? Remember Arjuna is a prince, what is the primary driving factor in a human being that is prince-like next to his intuitive nature that guides it? Will, will is the princely power in this mechanism, without will we are weaklings and will makes us strong, our intuitive nature directs the will to act to destroy the ignorance of emotional pulling, &ldquo;Take up your arrow and shoot.&rdquo; Shoot now away from emotion into devotion, get back into the devotional world, cut loose from greed, cut loose from all these things, these are kinsmen. Isn&rsquo;t greed a kinsmen to will too? It takes lots of will to be very over greedy or to be a glutton or to be passionate, you&rsquo;ve got to still generate will to do all these things and they are kinsmen to will, you cannot move anything without will. Master used to say &ldquo;show me where you can move an object without using your will&rdquo; and the scripture says &ldquo;there is no thing that moves except by divine will.&rdquo; Now divine will is already implanted in Man in two speeds, the lowest speed is ego will, the highest speed is cosmic will or divine will, and it only can be experienced by intuitive nature, which is called Kutastha Chaitanya, Christ Consciousness, or Buddha Nature, it goes back. You see Jesus says in His saying will, &ldquo;Father thy be done, not mine.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the Cosmic Will that is being done all the time, so will is kinsmen to all the emotional things. Now how are you going to cut loose? Intuition is telling you to cut loose, these kinsmen of greed, fear, anger, passion, lust, and all these things are going to trip you up, they&rsquo;re going to tear you down and cause you to discharge your whole mechanism from the emotional exit. Now learn to cut loose from them and understand them from a devotional nature, to do the same act without the emotional conditions. Audience: Without the emotional conditions is killing without killing? I mean it&rsquo;s killing without ruining yourself, it&rsquo;s getting rid of the negative and it&rsquo;s a positive. Adano: Yes. See if you go in an army, Master Yogananda said one time, there&rsquo;s a boy you know, he went to the Master one time he says, &ldquo;I want to avoid being in the army, I want to avoid going in and doing my duty.&rdquo; You know what the Master said to him? &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop the U.S. government from fighting the Koreans and I can&rsquo;t stop the Koreans from fighting the American people, but I can tell you this much, present yourself to thine allotted obligation and see what Cosmic Will will do for your life.&rdquo; So he went, drafted, he never left the United States, he was stuck in San Francisco as a signal operator. After going through all his basics at the last minutes orders came and switched him out of all the pile of them and made him a signal corps. Now Master is not interfering, the Master is not saying that these things are not there, it says, &ldquo;Your life after you ask, it is granted an extension&rdquo; but the man had the military training nevertheless, he knew how to kill, he was trained how to kill, but he didn&rsquo;t have to kill because there is the Divine Intercession. Now if we don&rsquo;t seek out the help of a Master, we will go out and kill, and that&rsquo;s also a lesson we have to learn. Now we can be broken in consciousness by the act or we can be helped after, a Master can intercede for you after too, after you perform the act a Master can help you there too. Audience: Well again Adano couldn&rsquo;t it be that if you find yourself in a position where you must kill, your motive has a lot to do with&hellip; Adano: Right. Audience: You&rsquo;re stopping him from doing damage and you still love him&hellip; Adano: Good. There are two men in the Army, this is an American soldier, he knew the Master, he was sent into the battlefield during the 1942 war you know and he was fighting and he dropped in a hole and another soldier it was all nighttime and they all dropped in the same hole and when sunlight came up, instead of seeing a fellow comrade in arms, he saw his opposite enemy. Now this is the joke, kill or be killed, all he said to himself &ldquo;God, Christ, Gurus&rdquo; in a loud voice and he says the other guy got so scared and jumped right out and dropped the gun and ran and he just ran the enemy and held him up and caught him as a prisoner. Now this is a disciple of the Master too that had this experience, knowing how to kill and did not kill you see. Now I have another friend, as I say these are intercessions in the personal life, it is not &ldquo;Man does not kill,&rdquo; some are their karma and they have to go to perform the act of killing but when you come into the life-stream or the auric nature of your Master whose sole purpose is to see you gain realization, you understand, then he helps to free. I sure wish&hellip; let&rsquo;s meditate, we have talked too much and that&rsquo;s what we really want to do, meditate. Do you have any of Kriyananda&rsquo;s records around here? (gap in tape)&hellip; 2:10 Charan Singh, Sai Baba, Saints and Sages of all religions, we bow to Thee all. May thy love shine on the sanctuary of our devotion (inaudible) Om, Shanti, Om, Peace, Om. Adonai Elohim, (inaudible), Om Mani Padme Hum. (Inaudible). Those who have to leave for their obligations can do so now. Those who want to meditate further can stay and meditate. Audience: If you want to get up and stretch. (Inaudible). Adano: In english now you would say if you take it all and broke it down, listen to yourself, the real nature of yourself and by the attunement you synchronize and become one with it you see. Learn to listen to your inner self and synchronize with it, so in Sanskrit or in Hebrew this is the whole fact, the translation is so broken up that it tends to distort you see but when you use the mantra itself it pulls because all the great Masters have used it to pull this consciousness. What is listening to it back now in the meditation is not your conscious self of this incarnation, it is the higher self that has been exposed to it from various lives you recognize and you pull back and automatically all the the cross currents of previous lives begin to diminish that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to use the Sanskrit mantras or the Hebrew mantras for meditation and Jesus only said &ldquo;I am my Father one&rdquo; but if you say &ldquo;Soa Hong&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s synchronized and you have been using it in so many incarnations, it&rsquo;s already synchronizing your mechanism to pull back or &ldquo;Hong Sau.&rdquo; (Inaudible). Our friends on the reservations are now getting to the heat of their meditation, they&rsquo;re now warming up. (Chanting) Om. Om. Om. (multiple times). Let us chant &ldquo;Thou Art My Life.&rdquo; Thou art my life, Thou art my love, Thou art the sweetness which I do seek. Thou art my life, Thou art my love, Thou art the sweetness which I do seek. In the thought by my love brought; In the thought by my love brought, In the thought by my love brought, I taste Thy name so sweet, so sweet. Devotee knows how sweet you are. Devotee knows how sweet you are. Devotee knows how sweet you are. He knows whom you let know. He knows whom you let know. (Repeated). Keeping the mind at the point between the eyebrows, watch and listen and feel and mentally broadcast &ldquo;Soa Hong.&rdquo; Heavenly Father, Divine Mother, Beloved Jesus, Supreme Master Babaji, Master Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswarji, Beloved Paramahansaji, Master Kirpal Singh, Master Charan Singh, Satya Sai Baba, Mataji, Saints and Sages of all religions we bow to thee all. May thy love shine on the sanctuary of our devotion that we may be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts. Om Shanti Om. Adonai Eloheinu. Om Mani Pad Mani Hum. (3 times.) Om Namo (inaudible).</p>
<h2 id="1968-october-10---open-meeting">1968 October 10 - Open Meeting</h2>
<p>Adano68_10_10OpenMeetingQ1NW0 - (Inaudible group conversation). (Playing Malaguena). Keep the mind on the top of the skull. (Music) 0:20 All the sounds in the chakras are incorporated in those music, even the &ldquo;ah&rdquo; and the &ldquo;e.&rdquo; The castanets represent the &ldquo;b&rdquo; of of the earth chakra, the string instruments represent the lumbar, the flute or reed instruments represent the sacral, the bell represents the heart. You notice the whole thing started with the bell? We can&rsquo;t go up, this is the halfway point, that&rsquo;s why when you hear the bell in your meditation, it&rsquo;s the first thing that pulls you up, it does not pull you down. It has no effect of pulling you down, it has the effect of pulling you up, that&rsquo;s why the God consciousness or the audible life current meets you halfway. We are trapped in the lower centers where everything is in a state of agitation, vibrating, pulsating, and as soon as we decide to pull up, the bell starts the tolling and the inner sound current, especially the holy breath, it pulls you up where it gets very very fine in tone, right out of your consciousness as if you were way out into space (inaudible). Now he was not able to capture a certain quality in music which you can only hear inside when you meditate, that&rsquo;s an experience not possible by a musical instrument, but this is an experience possible by the audible life current, it&rsquo;s a sound that is way beyond everything, incorporating everything, it stores up in the top of the brain. I know you have lots of questions to ask and before we ask these questions, meditation is a very important thing, we should have a few minutes of meditation to bring our consciousness and align it with the Divine Self. Now if you are in doubt as many people say you can&rsquo;t follow the path without the living Master or contact with some Master, rest assured one Master has already looked across the Ganges from the Himalayas into America and Europe and long decided the awakening of the Saints. His name is Babaji, give or take a few hundred years, 900 is good enough, he&rsquo;s not dead so that&rsquo;s sufficient to satisfy those people who say you must have living Masters. Even when you have the living Master that you meet them, it is still up to you as a person who has to raise your consciousness to draw Him into focus, it&rsquo;s like a radio station. Right now a radio station is beaming out all the radio waves and programs into this room but if you don&rsquo;t turn on the radio, no amount of bombarding it with the programs are going to let that program come in and if you don&rsquo;t answer the phone, no amount of ringing is going to get the answer coming through, that is exactly the relationship that goes on all the time between the Masters and ourselves. We must come to the mental microphone at the point between the eyebrow, we must do like we do on our radio, turn the switch on and center it and let the program come in. The radio don&rsquo;t direct the program, the radio just turns the switch, centers the needle, and let the program come in from that great transmitter God and that great program arranger Christ, that wonderful program, joy, is being beamed to Soul radio, Man. So let&rsquo;s turn on our switch and feel that joy program coming into our radio, our Soul radios. 0:30 (Adano chanting). Who is in my temple? Who is in my temple?

Om Namo Shivaya Om (Chanted multiple times). Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om. (Chanted multiple times). Om Om Om (Chanted three times then short meditation). Slowly open the eyes. I think we can ask our questions now. Does everyone know that tomorrow night is an initiation? Audience: Are you familiar with transcendental meditation? Adano: Yes. Audience: What do you think of it? Adano: If I have a bowl of cream and I want to make butter and I have a choice between a gold spoon, a wooden spoon, a brass spoon, a metal spoon, which one of the spoons would make the best butter? If it requires 350,000 revolutions for a spoon to bring cream to butter. Take any spoon and after you&rsquo;ve done 350,000 revolutions in the cream you have butter. The spoon only represents different types of mantras, the cream represents your consciousness, but it is the churning that brings butter. Transcendental meditation is just to give you one particular mantra, it&rsquo;s like a spoon, but if you don&rsquo;t churn with that spoon you can&rsquo;t have butter. So meditation no matter how much fancy names you put in front of it, boils down to one simple thing, whatever method you use, do it right, live up to it, you&rsquo;re gonna get better out of it, you&rsquo;re gonna get cosmic consciousness, you see? Now I remember a friend of mine his name is Kumar so a young boy came to him and said, &ldquo;Kumar I just paid 30 dollars for my initiation into transcendental meditation and I got a good mantra, I&rsquo;m going to get cosmic consciousness soon.&rdquo; So he said mantra nantra I got a million of them, still nobody can get cosmic consciousness yet.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the mantra, it is how much effort you put into the mantra, how much time and persistency you do.&rdquo; The idea behind it is this, in any one of these stories no matter what, if you don&rsquo;t take it and use it&hellip; Well a woman went to India and met Master Charan Singh, stayed in retreat for five months, he initiated her, he spoke to the group for five months while she was there and when she was ready to leave she says, &ldquo;Master can you give me something that will help me to gain cosmic consciousness?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Madam I gave you a mantra, use it.&rdquo; All right Lahiri Mahasaya was alive and one day a man came to him and said, &ldquo;Master I think I am ready for the second initiation.&rdquo; So the Master looked around and just then in walked in a postman and the postman&rsquo;s name was Brindaban. He said, &ldquo;Tell me Brindaban, do you think you are ready for the second initiation?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Oh no Master I came to ask you to turn down the first one, I can&rsquo;t perform my duties, God has got me so intoxicated.&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible) &hellip;the Master says &ldquo;Tell him to go away leave me alone.&rdquo; 0:50 Adano: See what mantra he took? &ldquo;Tell him to go away leave me alone.&rdquo; (Laughter) It didn&rsquo;t matter what spoon you use you see? In other words, what is involved, if you think this person can give you some insight into meditation, this man literally took what he said, &ldquo;tell him to go, leave me alone. So he thought well that is that&rsquo;s the mantra for him, &ldquo;tell him to go away and leave me alone, tell him to go away and leave me alone.&rdquo; So if we take one idea as Master says, Yogananda, he said &ldquo;if you take an idea and re-emphasize it, re-emphasize it, sooner or later your consciousness will accelerate upwards to expand itself.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the essence of the meditation is to be persistent, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you want to take &ldquo;tell him to go away leave me alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father I love you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Om mani padme hum&rdquo; or anything as long as you are persistent in doing it. It may seem childlike or it may seem very uh foolish or dogmatic to be repeating it as if that&rsquo;s all there is to religion, we don&rsquo;t know until we put ourselves to the test and the persistency. It&rsquo;s like planting a seed in the ground and if we don&rsquo;t water it or look after it and it bursts out as a tree, now if we&rsquo;re gonna dig it up every day to see if it&rsquo;s growing, it&rsquo;ll never grow you see. Now it&rsquo;s like a woman, the moment she gets pregnant she can&rsquo;t have the baby right away, she still goes through the changes until the nine months of delivery but that&rsquo;s the period that is required. Equally true the period required when we are given some instruction to meditate is not so much important is how long our attitude of sticking with it, what is our attitude in going through it? Let&rsquo;s say if that man repeated &ldquo;tell him to go away leave me alone&rdquo; took a year to do that and if he knew he would have to do this a year, he wouldn&rsquo;t do it you see. So no one told him how long he had to do it, he just took the statement that these men told him, that the Master said to him, &ldquo;tell him to go away leave me alone&rdquo; so he took that as the driving point and he kept watering the mind with it. So it&rsquo;s the same with meditation in any way or idea you take, (inaudible) just feed it. So you see it&rsquo;s not so much what we name the meditation, it&rsquo;s how much we do of it like in the Psalms you know, first verse, first Psalm, &ldquo;meditate day and night on the law of the lord&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t that what it says? Well if you&rsquo;re gonna do it day and night that means 24 hours. Now if the law of the Lord, he took the teacher&rsquo;s word as the law, he looked upon the teacher as the Lord manifest and the word was &ldquo;go away and leave me alone&rdquo; you see and he literally, 24 hours a day, kept thinking of that and that was it. Now if you literally take these words, &ldquo;Father I love You&rdquo; 24 hours a day before you know it the consciousness has to open. It&rsquo;s like the Chinese torture chamber, one drop of water every day eventually cracks the stone, they don&rsquo;t care how long that water keeps dropping on that stone but one drop a day will gradually break it. The consciousness contains Cosmic Consciousness already, it takes that constant bombarding inside to open it, it&rsquo;s like a nut in the shell, it&rsquo;s a constant hammering or hitting it to crack it open, then the nut comes out, equally true the experience of Cosmic Consciousness is the same. I remember reading where Mr. Lynn was given the experience of Cosmic Consciousness by Yogananda, it says that after he was initiated, he kept on practicing his meditation over and over and over and over, one day the experience opened up, then I met a man his name is Dixon, he was mentioned by in the Autobiography by Yogananda. When I met him he told me what had happened to him, he said after the Master initiated him and told him that you&rsquo;re supposed to do one million revolutions of the holy breath in the spine and he would attain cosmic consciousness so he was very sincere and very assidious and zealous in doing his holy breath and after he had chalked up one million, he came one morning to see Yogananda and he knocked at the door and he&rsquo;s got a piece of paper and the dates and everything he says, &ldquo;Master this is my report card, I did a million.&rdquo; He said so Master looked at him and said, &ldquo;So what do you want?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I want cosmic consciousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;You got it.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;When you churn cream into butter and after the butter is formed, can you take the spoon out? You think? It&rsquo;s stuck in the butter, the spoon and the butter and the bowl all one.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;After a million you are it, as you think, that is what&rsquo;s gonna happen now.&rdquo; Well from then on he says &ldquo;wherever he (inaudible) in the garden, the flowers will react&rdquo; and then he began to see that cosmic consciousness (inaudible) but he was that zealous in his act, he never gave up, he never deviated, he literally took Master at his word and went and did a million until his consciousness (inaudible). Essentially that&rsquo;s what the whole thing is you see, persistency, don&rsquo;t give up. Audience: How long did it take? Adano: To do a million? Well now they say 40 years, it takes 40 years to do a million, that&rsquo;s providing you&rsquo;re doing it so many per day but it&rsquo;s not designed that way, after so many years it doubles itself and the maximum you do is 108 revolutions which is exactly the amount of beads on a rosary. You see when the rosary was designed with 108 beads for exactly what the amount per day that the body can stand in the revolving of the energy around the spinal column but you can&rsquo;t do 100 a day right away off to start, that is a progressed program. Now advanced yogis who come into this world, in three and a half years can do it and achieve cosmic consciousness in three and a half years, they are capable of doing 1000 revolutions in the spine per day but they have to be pretty advanced to withstand the tremendous vibratory force generated by that excessive amount of practice. They don&rsquo;t have any other work to do, so most of these advanced yogis already come into homes that are or in areas where they don&rsquo;t meet too many people to interfere with their practice but we are not in that category so we take take it slow. 1:00 Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well you see the Master said that there is the elliptical path, bipolarity around the spine. Now the elliptical path around the spine is involved with the astrological signs of the zodiac but until we establish where we are in the spinal column, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to visualize it you see. Now we are in the aquarian age therefore aquarius is located here in the elliptical path then the next one up is pisces which is in the sacral then the next one up is aries which is in the lumbar on the right side going up the elliptical path. Now we in the ascent of the clock, now then we have taurus in line of the dorsal then we have gemini which is in line with the throat on the elliptical path of the ascent of the clock. Then we have moon or cancer then we have leo sun, then we come down again the elliptical path and we have virgo which is again on this side of the throat. Then you have libra which is again on this side of the heart, then you have a scorpio which is in line with the lumbar, then you have sagittarius which is in line of the sacral, you have capricorn down by this side of the coccyx but you first start to establish aquarius in this age for the holy breath. Now were you living in the piscean age then the piscean age would be on the descent of the clock so you&rsquo;d have to first localize the piscean part in the inner anatomy and then move up the elliptical movement again. In each age we come back and whatever that age is when we pick up the holy breath, we have to first localize that position in the age in the elliptical path in the inner anatomy and then the movement of the current revolves around this elliptical path by polarity. Now it&rsquo;s this elliptical movement that is speeding it up, now when you meditate you&rsquo;re supposed to be aware of not only the centers where they&rsquo;re located but you&rsquo;re supposed to be aware of the elliptical path around these centers that&rsquo;s why the signs of the zodiac are already established in each age that we&rsquo;re in. Now we are in aquarius so we automatically think where aquarius is, now if we look at the planets controlling each one of these signs of the zodiac you see a very interesting thing, aquarius is governed by what planet? Uranus, which is the mystic planet right? Alright, then we take pisces which is governed by neptune right? This is the next planet and this part of the sacral, then we take aries that is going by mars, now then we go back up to taurus which is governed by venus but that&rsquo;s in line with the heart and then we go up to gemini which is governed by mercury that&rsquo;s in line with the throat. Now moon is moon, which is cancer, and sun is sun which leo which is the head, then we come back on the elliptical path this side we have virgo governed by mercury and gemini governed by mercury on the other side, it&rsquo;s by polarity. Mercury is here and mercury is here, then we go to the next one down from virgo to libra and that is governed by venus and we have taurus on this side governed by venus but venus is the heart center but venus represented love again, the heart center by polarity. Now we have not only venus on the left side on the right side governing the heart center but then we have scorpio governed by mars where we have aries on the other side is governed by mars, then we have sagittarius which is governed by jupiter and in sanskrit it&rsquo;s called Guru which is the teacher, and on the opposite side we have neptune which is in pisces then capricorn is saturn which is also the disciplinarian just like uranus which is the mystic but you have the elliptical path going on inside and you draw from this elliptical path in your meditation because we draw from these centers and we draw from them their potentials, their psychological potential, their magnetic potentials, as the current revolves and registers in the spine. So if you think not only of the center as the focal point of the energy but you think of the bipolarity of the zodiac movement in relation to the center in your meditation, that&rsquo;s why your mind must be centered on the inner universe, then you have now a movement going inside. You see to start the process we give a mantram or you get your mind to repeat something, that is to steady it, but once you&rsquo;re identifing then you&rsquo;re starting the rhythmic movement inside. That is why the person must be initiated, to have this energy moving and that is why darshan or the constant meeting of the initiate and the blessings of the Master enhances that movement inside. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well, didn&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s like when you put this key into an ignition switch and turn the switch, we have the motor revved up, initiation is linking you to the current of the Master, the Master current that turns the switch here and revs it up. That&rsquo;s why when you start back your meditation as an initiate, the non-initiate does not know this, but the initiate when he meditates he must relive the experience of initiation just like a car, you must put the key in the ignition to shift into gears. 1:10 So if you relive the experience of initiation, automatically you are switching on the ignition and triggering the current to go from that experience and causing that experience to multiply and expand and as it expands then the shifting of the gears inside, you&rsquo;re starting to go into different dimensions, into the different levels, which is what you want to actually but to relive the experience is important, it&rsquo;s is like putting the key into the ignition switch and turning that is always reliving the experience every day, when you turn that key in the ignition switch the motor revs up. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You&rsquo;re supposed to meditate one tenth portion of 24 hours, it&rsquo;s the origin of tithing, two and a half hours per day, &ldquo;render unto Caesar what are Caesar&rsquo;s, render unto God what are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Now we know the render to Caesar that is tribute or income tax, unto God income is breath. Now if one tenth portion is rendered to Caesar in terms of physical income, one tenth portion of breath is two and a half hours meditation per day broken down into one hour in the morning, one in evening, and a half an hour in the middle of the day, that is one tenth portion of the day. Until you&rsquo;re capable of doing one tenth portion per sitting, that&rsquo;s a two and a half hour session in the morning and two and a half hour session at night or two and a half hour session in the middle of the day, but that&rsquo;s one tenth portion and that&rsquo;s the origin of tithing, the real tithing to the Lord, see this is the temple, so one tenth portion of 24 hours is two and a half hours of meditation. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well like Anand Swami said when his teacher asked him, &ldquo;How long can you meditate without fidgeting?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Two and a half hours.&rdquo; The degrees of fidgeting is an indication or a measurement of how deep you&rsquo;re going. Audience: Do you have to do it all at one time? Adano: No no no no, you start off with an hour in the morning, an hour in the evening, and half an hour in the middle of the day. Audience: You keep talking about breath but how is it possible to initiate anyone who has not learned breath control. Adano: When you&rsquo;re initiated, that is taught to you. Audience: And you can get it that quickly? Adano: Yes, interesting. Audience: Devotional reading, does that have to be added to that two and a half hours? Adano: Oh yes, you need your devotional reading to enhance your devotion. Audience: You mean is that considered part of meditation is what you&rsquo;re asking? Adano: No it&rsquo;s not considered meditation. You see one time a Master was passing through this country and he visited a beach and on the beach he saw the Hare Krishna group chanting for a long time you know, they were chatting for practically an hour, and he looked and he looked and he said after it was all over, &ldquo;You know these people have tremendous devotion but no inner realization?&rdquo; All the chanting is not going to get down to the fact of meditating or going inside, you&rsquo;ve got to go inside, you&rsquo;ve got to cycle this force inside. Audience: It&rsquo;s better to do 15 minutes every day of meditation regularly than an hour today and three days later an hour and a week later two and a half hours. Audience: (Inaudible) So you multiply 15 minutes every two hours how many how many minutes you have? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Okay you want to do two and a half hours, do 15 minutes every two hours, in 24 hours this will come out the same way. Instead of saying you can&rsquo;t sit down and do an hour or two hours, two and a half, break it up in 15 minutes sessions every two hours. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Let me tell you something, you know where I did most of my meditation? In the bathroom, in the toilet (laughter), yeah my private toilet, you know. When you when you pray, retreated into your innermost chamber or closet and I literally took Master Jesus and went into the toilet every 15 minutes every two hours. See sometime I&rsquo;m here, I said &ldquo;let me just go into the bathroom&rdquo; and I walk in and come back out. (Laughter) That is true, I got many of my marvelous insights or experiences with God right in there, some people said&hellip; Audience: You were away from the work but you know for a reason, you could leave and everyone would kind of excuse you. Adano: Going to the bathroom? Yeah nobody questions you when you go to the bathroom, it stacks up as a normal procedure of the body, so for a few seconds in there you can collect your mind and tune to God and come back out. God is not concerned with the dirtiness of the environment, to Him everything is clean, it&rsquo;s only our mental attitude of the area we&rsquo;re in. The idea is that because we associate that spot as an eliminating spot, it wouldn&rsquo;t be considered to the mind as a practical place to meditate, just as much you don&rsquo;t consider the dining table as a practical place to meditate, the mind does this. So in the early stages we say to the mind, find a spot that you consider feasible or amenable to your nature and sit there and meditate, dedicate that spot, so you call that your meditative spot and so your mind accepts this, but after a while you have to realize that meditation has nothing to do with the spot, it has to do with your awareness of yourself. So how much you can harness this consciousness, how much you can bring this consciousness to steady itself inside, to feel. Audience: How about if you fall asleep in the meditation? Adano: Sleeping is not a good habit, it has a tendency to make you mediumistic and leave yourself open and off guard and you tend to drift away into different lower realms of consciousness. Jesus rebuked his disciples for that, so we see that sleeping is not a practical thing in meditation, you know they were in the garden meditating and He said when He came back and saw them sleeping, He says, &ldquo;Spirit is willing, but flesh is weak, could you not pray a while with Me?&rdquo; Or meditate a while, in other words when you try to fall asleep or you do fall asleep it&rsquo;s not practical you&rsquo;re drifting away, meditation is not to drift it is to be aware, to be conscious. Since you are trying to get into that realm of consciousness under the various levels of Being you have to be aware, so you can&rsquo;t drift about inside, that&rsquo;s why Yogananda made a chant to help the person not to drift in his meditation and this chant was, &ldquo;who is in my temple, who is in my temple, all the doors open by themselves.&rdquo; that is a very good indication that you don&rsquo;t open it, &ldquo;all the lights go on by themselves and darkness like a dark bird flies away.&rdquo; So the alertness of looking inside for when the doors begin to open from inside themselves and the light comes on from inside, then your consciousness expand. 1:20 Now the doors of consciousness are sealed in from inside, you don&rsquo;t lock a door on the outside and leave yourself on the inside, you lock yourself in from the inside right, unless when you go out and when you lock out, you&rsquo;re not in the house, so your inner consciousness is locked in. Now if you use a chemical to gain an experience you&rsquo;re blasting the door down, therefore you&rsquo;ve pulled out all the safety factors of the brain, the experience is not a pleasant one, it can be tragic, but it&rsquo;s not a cosmic experience either because you may blast the door down and end up in the toilet not end up in the living room, not end up where the you want to go, see the chemical experience is not genuine. Now because it opens from within itself naturally without any coercion on our part, then we realize that God is already vibrating inside, so when you meditate and if you want to repeat that chant and use that as a paddle to churn the consciousness, then it&rsquo;s the best because it makes you aware of what is going to happen. &ldquo;Who is in my temple, who is in my temple. All the doors open by themselves, all the lights open by themselves and darkness like a dark bird flies away.&rdquo; I should let you folks go home, you gotta go to work tomorrow. Is there any other questions? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: &ldquo;When thou prayest, pray unceasingly.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that what the Master Jesus admonished some of his disciples? Un-ceasingly, without ceasing, so if you mentally repeat that name or mantra unceasingly it&rsquo;s like churning, night and day, the psalm says you must meditate on the law night and day, the law is that particular idea that is revolving in consciousness night and day, till this thing opens up. You have a nut here, coconut for instance, they use that as a good symbol in East, the kernel and the milk is inside and you can&rsquo;t get it until you whack and whack and whack and whack till it breaks, there just ain&rsquo;t no way. The consciousness is not in an egg, when you whack if it breaks right away, don&rsquo;t work that way, you got a thick skull, it&rsquo;s full of encrusted, past, unfulfilled desires and if we don&rsquo;t crack away those on barnacles of desires or frustrations we can&rsquo;t get the thing, we gotta crack it open. It&rsquo;s like (inaudible) hammering at the thing, so prayer unceasingly is what is involved. Now you take the life of Theresa of Avila, she repeated the Lord&rsquo;s prayer over and over and over and over (inaudible) and you go among some Catholic Mystics male or female they do their rosary over and over and over and over. We know of a friend, you know Beatrice (inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible) &hellip;she knew she was working on the inner planes and she was not aware of what she was doing and one day she said she wanted to be a aware, fully aware while in the physical what she was doing on the inner planes because we&rsquo;re working in all the planes (inaudible) you didn&rsquo;t see her you just see this little chubby blonde lady (inaudible) &hellip; &ldquo;Lord, I want to know what I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;m gonna sit here and say the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer until you let me know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; (inaudible). Adano: Don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed for a while (laughter). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s like Buddha says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit under this Banyan tree till I rot or die, till I get cosmic&hellip;&rdquo; You know, &ldquo;till I get it.&rdquo; It is a sort of consistency that is involved in the thing. Audience: Tell me where did I get the idea that meditation (inaudible)&hellip; Adano: You see prayer unceasingly in the East they call that Simran or Japa which means conscious repetition. Now because of the conscious repetition the mind becomes still, then you begin to merge, the meditation begins to become oneness, but you can&rsquo;t really merge with this conscious beingness unless you bring this particular churning mind or wandering mind into that particular state. So really we can&rsquo;t say to ourselves that we are meditating as yet until we have done this internal churning you see, then we&rsquo;re really meditating. We must bring this internal churning or using some mantra or prayer to bring this thing into a point. It&rsquo;s all right, cream is watery and slushy and when you churn it, it becomes a stiff, don&rsquo;t move right? It&rsquo;s still for the first time. Okay you&rsquo;ve see in the lake and when the breeze blow across it what happens to the lake? Now how would you make the lake one pointed? Freeze it, so the same thing with the restless mind, you have to apply some process of freezing it into a position where it can be now solid enough to trust it to work. This is exactly what is involved in the meditation, this principle of the holy breath and the repetition of the mantra, they bring the mind into that state of freezing. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;Love the Lord with all your mind,&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say part, He said all, &ldquo;with all your heart.&rdquo; Now with all your mind, if you don&rsquo;t fall asleep then your mind is centered, you&rsquo;re aware, it&rsquo;s not drifting now. With all your heart would help to reinforce your awareness by placing the thumb on the pulse, feeling the pulse beat, this will help to intensify the awareness, it will help to focus it more, and with all your strength that would be the breath because then you&rsquo;d be observant more again of something physically involved, and Soul that&rsquo;s the whole nature now. Then the meditation begins to have dimension, it starts to take a true perspective. 1:30 Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Gautama became Buddha by doing that, that&rsquo;s all he had, &ldquo;So Hong&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hong So&rdquo; if you want to call it that, that is the basis of The Secret of the Golden Flower, a book that is called The Secret of the Golden Flower. That is the oldest mantra that has come down through the ages in every form of religious study in meditation and this is what Gautama used, he had it, translated it means &ldquo;I am He&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am That.&rdquo; Now Jesus might say &ldquo;I and my Father are one,&rdquo; you could use that too &ldquo;I and my Father one,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a mantra, it&rsquo;s a perfect mantra representing &ldquo;So Hong,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just a sanskrit word, anything you use over and over and emphasize it. In other words what we&rsquo;re trying to say is this, a restless mind can be made to come to heel like a dog or brought into control by the emphasis of repetition, repetition is a principle of making the restless mind slow down, repetition leads to acceleration, without repetition you can&rsquo;t have acceleration. Take your automobile, you turn the engine on, the pistons are going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, but they&rsquo;re only going at a certain speed up and down, you shift the gears they&rsquo;re ready to roll, but if you don&rsquo;t press on the accelerator that up and down is not going to increase but you keep that increasing that up and down, up and down, what have you got? You got more and more and more and more and more and more so the more you are involving yourself with the unceasingness with the idea, the wider the expansion of your consciousness becomes, that is the essence of it. Yes? Audience: (Inaudible). Was somebody going to show you their apples? Adano: Yes, you want to show it to me now? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Where the initiation will be tomorrow night? Audience: (Inaudible). Right at that corner you&rsquo;ll see a little motel, you go one block and you hit a dead end and you see the lake in front of you and you turn left and it turns right back into Pacific, it&rsquo;s directly across the street from the Catholic Church and it&rsquo;s downstairs at the rear if you come in through the hedge and it&rsquo;s at 7:30 and once it begins we have to check the building. Please be there before 7:30. Adano: When the next initiation for the old ones to come then, they can bring another apple, not this one, this is initiation number one. You see the man asked Lahiri Mahasaya, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for the second initiation&rdquo; and he said to the other one, &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re ready for it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I come to ask you to shut down the first one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t complain that you&rsquo;re (inaudible.&rdquo; Audience: I just want to be sure you&rsquo;re going to be at (inaudible) tomorrow morning. I don&rsquo;t want to go to the wrong place. Adano: (Inaudible). Get a piece of paper and I&rsquo;ll write it out, they both represent the dissolver. (gap in tape) The frequency when you treat, if you&rsquo;re treating somebody you have the wavelength of dissolve, so I&rsquo;m treating let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m praying for this person, so &ldquo;divine will flowing through me will dissolve those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of this individual,&rdquo; but my wavelength is &ldquo;will dissolve.&rdquo; If I were using her wavelength I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;divine will flowing through me will rebuild all those conditions necessary for the harmonious and normal flow of this individual&rdquo; and with hers it would be &ldquo;divine will flowing through me will eliminate all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of the individual.&rdquo; You see the wavelength? Audience: Well one of the apples started out that way then it changed. Adano: Then it went to dissolve. It has to go the complete thing like this you see, powdery and fall apart (inaudible) because each wavelength is different according to the way you&rsquo;re locked into the Master charge. Keep this because this is still in a state of showing that this strength of the charge is still holding. It&rsquo;s already representing eliminate, yours is dissolved and hers is dissolve, yours is dissolve. Strengthen is to shrivel up. Now when it grows an extra quarter of an inch and it gets green like a green apple on the tree and the odor increases in the room, that&rsquo;s life over death you&rsquo;ve found another Master. Audience: Why should we keep them to know the charge is still&hellip; Adano: Until it&rsquo;s completely broken down you rather keep it because it indicates the charge is still working, you don&rsquo;t want to dispose of it right away, but we know we have established what the charge is. So I&rsquo;d rather you still keep it for a while but in the way it&rsquo;s already gone to where it squashes, you know that&rsquo;s not going to go any further. Sometimes it goes powdery powdery all the way until the whole thing turns into (inaudible). The charge is still working but we have established what the charge represented here. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: A Master, when he comes back anytime, he comes up with the power of life over death. Audience: And he didn&rsquo;t know this? Adano: His measurement would be indicat it (inaudible), that&rsquo;s why he has to be initiated. You&rsquo;ve got to be initiated to measure the thing. Audience: (Inaudible). 1:40 (Inaudible group conversation). &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will eliminate those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of this individual. It has been said, it is done, so be it.&rdquo; Tomorrow after the initiation we&rsquo;ll discuss the power of the healing, how each initiate works with his healing frequencies. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Fire is elimination, burning out of the karma. Why the Yogi wears orange? That is to say he has burnt out all the karma by the fires of wisdom through his meditation. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: The stove is the body and you&rsquo;re just burning the karma out of this body, no you&rsquo;re doing wonderful, you&rsquo;re making good progress. Audience: Do I have to wait until the apple breaks down? Adano: Well how are you going to know? (Inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No, that&rsquo;s a different frequency. Audience: (Inaudible group conversation). Adano: It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will rebuild those conditions that are necessary for the normal and harmonious flow of this individual. It has been said, it is done, so be it.&rdquo; And repeat that seven times, but tomorrow night after the initiation we will discuss that, how the initiate uses charges and that&rsquo;s why everyone who&rsquo;s initiated should bring their apples tomorrow because when you start putting in categories. You see up there they heal in a blanket way and everybody sit in a chair (inaudible), the initiate heals different, those who are rebuilders, those who are strengtheners, those who are eliminators, and those that are dissolvers, it&rsquo;s done like this. You take the names of the people who need to be healed or helped and then you break it into three categories: occupation if they&rsquo;re lacking in occupation, if they&rsquo;re lacking in health you put it on their health, strengthen comes under the occupation, eliminate comes under health, harmony that the family life is dissolve. Now they are broken up, all the problems are broken up into three categories to represent the three phases of the trinity, if you&rsquo;re out of a job, if you&rsquo;re building a new program or anything this is all occupation, they fall under strengthen. If it&rsquo;s health in any form that falls under eliminate, if it&rsquo;s mutual problems with two people or family it falls under dissolve. You put the names and each one repeats so those who are strengthened they repeat that name, see? Audience: This is the group initiates now, this is the whole group. Adano: Right, now if it&rsquo;s health then the eliminator is repeated, if it&rsquo;s a mutual problem the dissolver is repeated, but the rebuilder, the all the rebuilders do something different. Now let&rsquo;s say we have Mary, John, Albert, they need occupation, right? Now if we say Adam, Eve, and Joe they need health and let&rsquo;s say we have Bill, Marta, and Fred they need mutual harmony. So the strengtheners repeat theirs coming down this way, one two three right? The eliminators they repeat one two three. The dissolvers one two three, their job is finishing. The rebuilders their job begins now, they start taking the same name and go backwards to the top and take the next one and go backwards to the top and take the third and go backwards to the top, they do all three. Whereas these others do it downward once, the rebuilders do it once backwards up, each one of them. Audience: What kind of apple is a strengthener? Adano: It shrivels up like a prune. 1:50 Now the rebuilders are the ones who rebuild but they work from&hellip; this is where you get the principle &ldquo;the first is last and last is first.&rdquo; Every prayer group always read their names down, read their names down, read the name down but they never read name backwards up. Now the rebuilder is the one who works the name up backwards. Audience: Here I have a list of names here. Adano: You can take the same framework and set it up with your initiate group now and start working with it, get the rebuilders to have the&hellip; all they&rsquo;re going to do is just say the name backwards up. So like if this is Adam and he&rsquo;s the last one then he&rsquo;s going to be the first you see in a backward up movement and everyone is backward up for rebuilders and the others are saying it forward down once. They don&rsquo;t have to say three times, you are actually saying for everyone backward up, only the rebuilders can do that. Now the Master or the one that has life over death, he is a Master, he just&hellip; how he does, he raises. Audience: Adano the person who (inaudible) does that mean that is what they are working on or how they function. Adano: That&rsquo;s how they function. (Inaudible). Audience: In our various lives do we all have to (Inaudible). Adano: Yes, in our various lives so we are bringing them back and we have to learn to use all of them in one incarnation. Audience: But we all have had different kinds of having all of these? Adano: So that&rsquo;s where your four initiations come in to tie them all in. Now so the frequency that you are locked in, this is what you&rsquo;re working with, this specific charge you&rsquo;re working on, you see. So one is not better than the other, don&rsquo;t get that impression, they&rsquo;re just set up this way and they function that way in the particular category of the problems involved. Now a person who has health, you can&rsquo;t dissolve the disease, it&rsquo;s to eliminate that disease out of their frame of reference, so you&rsquo;re changing the image pattern, when you eliminate that pattern of their consciousness, so only the eliminators work on the health problems. Now occupation, people don&rsquo;t have the strength and the gumption to get up every morning to go face their work in their occupation and yet they say the world is crashing in on them &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like my surroundings where I work.&rdquo; So the strengtheners, they frequently go out to those people who lack the jobs, who are lacking in fighting the world to get some type of an occupation or to stay in an occupation, to buck the tide, you see what you&rsquo;re doing? The strengtheners are strengthening their consciousness because that&rsquo;s what they are lacking, why are they failing to have an abundance because they don&rsquo;t have the strength to face or push for it. Audience: What about ourselves, if we needed strength for our occupation? Adano: Put your name down, let the rest (inaudible). (Laughter) All the initiates names are in it, that&rsquo;s why we want to have all the names in it (inaudible), we&rsquo;re recycling the energy all the time that way. Now the rebuilders are ones reverse all the time, that closes the circle. Audience: If I work work alone on this list, which I do at night at bedtime, shall I read it backwards? Adano: Yes, you should read it backwards, but it&rsquo;s wise if you can have when your initiate meditation gets together, have your healing circle, and then each one who (inaudible) challenge work and then the rebuilders work back. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes but do you always put the names of all the initiates on the list because it is that particular focal point of building, they don&rsquo;t have to ask, they&rsquo;re on the list automatically. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: In the initiate group it&rsquo;s not what they need, they&rsquo;re put under their own particular frequencies. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: So when you&rsquo;re in that frequency, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you need a job (inaudible). If you work with your own frequency all the time, so you don&rsquo;t want to go out of your frequency until you&rsquo;ve established it but that&rsquo;s what we call blanketing, that is taking for granted or guessing. So if you stay within the frequency and build the frequency, you have something now to work with, so by putting yourself in the category and working in the category then you can extend, so this is what you do now. As you grow you start to see how it&rsquo;s merging because before you know it, you&rsquo;re in all of them. you see your consciousness starts working, but first establish but at the same time by its establishment, when you&rsquo;re working on others this emphasizes it you see because you&rsquo;re not depleting the frequency because you have a sense of fear that I&rsquo;m depleting myself and this is to avoid that thought pattern because you&rsquo;re in the same frequency, your own frequency is recycling itself. This is the only reason why it&rsquo;s set up that way but you work with it that way and Jesus chose 12 people with 12 signs of the zodiac and he broke it down in three because there were four forms of 4 powers so three of the group had one each because you got the positive, negative, and neutral. So each one, there were three to each one of these in his group of 12, but was the Master, he was the fifth one, he had life and death control. Now you can imagine who was the rebuilder, it&rsquo;s very simple Peter, James, and John were the rebuilders, it&rsquo;s very simple to figure out. (Inaudible), from the way they behave you can figure it out, I&rsquo;m gonna give you something to do, your little homework. Audience: Am I a rebuilder now because I was a tearer-downer before? (Laughter). Adano: Well it could be. Audience: (Inaudible conversation). Adano: Well you should know from now, you don&rsquo;t need me now to tell you, you can recognize them. When it&rsquo;s squashy and watery that&rsquo;s what dissolve is. When it&rsquo;s powdery like you saw tonight, that&rsquo;s eliminate. When it turns like a prune, shriveled up wrinkled, just wrinkle there&rsquo;s no squashiness there&rsquo;s no odor, there&rsquo;s no powder it&rsquo;s just wrinkled like a prune, that is to strengthen. If it&rsquo;s firm it&rsquo;s rebuild. The fifth one you&rsquo;ll know him because the odor alone will kill you by the time he comes in the room, the apple is so strong you can&rsquo;t believe that this apple is radiating it. So you know and it&rsquo;s so firm, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about this one, but once you&rsquo;ve got that now the group knows exactly which one (inaudible) lined up and if you have the names of the group now you just can make up the chart and then the group has what is called a functional movement now and take your ARE names because these people need help. (Inaudible) but then also line up the initiates in it. Each initiate in the group must be lined up because their need comes, they must not be praying for themselves, you understand? So the thing is that they are lined up in it, so even if their name are repeated because they&rsquo;re dissolved and you say &ldquo;Adano&rdquo; but that he is not referring to himself because he&rsquo;s taking in the frequency because that frequency is recycling because the person who is doing the rebuilding is going to repeat &ldquo;Adano,&rdquo; you see? Because the rebuilders are repeating each of the names in the categories so the person, if I am an initiate and I fall under the category of dissolve, my name would be there, if I&rsquo;m repeating my own name, this would be to emphasize my existence but the rebuilder is the one that removed my ego because I&rsquo;m not praying for myself you see, I&rsquo;m only emphasizing the fact that I&rsquo;m in this cycle. So when the person who is doing the rebuilding part reads my name, that part of ego praying for myself is automatically released, you see. So if you&rsquo;ve got 10 rebuilders reading the thing back, look how many people are reading back your name, you&rsquo;re only reading it once, you follow? That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s involved to establish your identity but if you&rsquo;re five or six rebuilders reading it backwards, they are the ones who are actually cycling the energy. 2:00 So your ego can never get in the place and you are working for the others, the other names along with you (inaudible). Audience: Can I ask about the spoon and butter problem? (Inaudible) Say you&rsquo;re working with a wooden spoon but you find that you get a few splinters, should you switch spoons or should you try to use the wooden spoon to wear it down so it fits you. Adano: You don&rsquo;t need to change spoons because it&rsquo;s made of wood, sooner or later when the cream comes into butter and you start using the butter (inaudible). The splinters will never become the butter, there just ain&rsquo;t no way a splinter is going to turn into butter, the splinter is a splinter. Audience: It can keep you back and slow you down. Adano: No it won&rsquo;t slow you down, it will be obvious in the churning, it will be noticeable in the churning because you&rsquo;ll start to see it as you churn. So then after a while you&rsquo;re gonna yank it out as you keep churning because you&rsquo;re gonna recognize it&rsquo;s a splinter. What I&rsquo;m saying is this, little splinters are going to eliminate themselves out of it. Audience: Well this one&rsquo;s maybe a little bit bigger because the problem is when I (inaudible), I go in for five minutes and I get this&hellip; you know everything&rsquo;s going on just great and all of a sudden I just shake and I have to come out (inaudible) down there for 10 minutes and just feel like a mess. It&rsquo;s like I was run over by a steam roller and you know you can&rsquo;t go on, you can&rsquo;t do anything for the rest of the day. So I don&rsquo;t know whether I should go in and try. Adano: &ldquo;Normal symptoms of a patient&rdquo; says the doctor when he took the thermometer out of his mouth. What I&rsquo;m saying is this, the quivering of the body after a few minutes of meditation is an indication of the shutting down, did you attend the lecture this afternoon? The purpose of the meditation is to shut down to have conscious death, the technique is to bring it to this point where we are shutting down. What does butter look like, it&rsquo;s a closing up condition of the cream, the quiverings are the death throes of the life energy in the body through the nervous system to let you experience conscious death, you&rsquo;re not going to die. Audience: Yeah, it just feels like it. Adano: You&rsquo;re going to have all the symptoms of it but you ain&rsquo;t gonna die, don&rsquo;t worry, you ain&rsquo;t gonna die before your time but you&rsquo;ll have all the symptoms of it. Audience: (Inaudible) like when we were talking now and you open your mouth and my heart&rsquo;s pounding in my ears right now, when you talk. Okay it&rsquo;s not just my excitement, what is it? Because you&rsquo;re you and I&rsquo;m me? Adano: It&rsquo;s not excitement,Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly,&rdquo; life is energy, energy is stimulation of the cells, so the body is electrically extrasensory stimulated to transform itself. This is not a conversation, neither is this a lecture when we get together, it&rsquo;s always Satsanga. So the Swami is Satsanga all the time, there&rsquo;s no such thing as getting together and holding a little talk in there and ask questions and answers or getting together (inaudible). Before I became a Swami, it would have been that but the moment the person is initiated into that, this is a responsibility called Sansanga, it&rsquo;s an extrasensory force going on all the time. So there are changes automatically for every question that asked. One, your physical body has to be satisfied with the physical change there at the time. Two, your mental nature has got to be adjusted. Three, the extra sensory forces are going to be lined up. Audience: Well this pounding when you talk is them trying to line up? Adano: How else are you going to get the sound current is through this (inaudible). Audience: I can hear you alright, but head is going &ldquo;boom, boom, boom.&rdquo; Adano: Believe me, this is what it&rsquo;s all about, it&rsquo;s the extrasensory forces going through you. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly,&rdquo; more energy flowing in and one boy was studying with Yogananda and he said &ldquo;Master come in at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning and everybody is ready to go to bed you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I will sit down and work now&rdquo; and nobody wants to go to bed because he said they were so full of vitality, they want to get up, they&rsquo;re pounding, vibrating, and hustling around to do activities because they can just feel this vibration fitting them all the time and then they ask the Master one night, &ldquo;why is it only when he comes around they feel this? He says &ldquo;this is what life is.&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Alright if you sit in my presence, (inaudible) you&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re peaceful? You&rsquo;re a live wire for the first time your body is alive, it&rsquo;s vibrating in the presence of consciousness. Now therefore what is consciousness? Not to drift away into unconsciousness or into dreamland, it&rsquo;s to be alive, so you&rsquo;re drawing more of the life, then when you&rsquo;re not in the presence then that reservoir (inaudible), from that reservoir you draw. First the churning. (Inaudible). Do you want to come back? Audience: I always want to come back.</p>
<h2 id="1968-october-12---initiate-instruction">1968 October 12 - Initiate Instruction</h2>
<p>Adano68_10_12InitiateInstructionsQ1NW0 - Now the moon affects the tide in 24 hours, you have a high tide and a low tide and you have a full moon once a month (inaudible), constantly going on, there is no lag in 24 hours or 28 days (inaudible), like in the ocean the birth stone itself is the one in the time you&rsquo;re born in and that&rsquo;s the one that shows the frequency to draw the magnetic current to your body and that has to be above six hertz, below that the piezo electric effect has no effect (inaudible). Now there are three basic metals plus two others interwoven there, gold, silver, and copper are the basic metals (inaudible) except when the bracelet requires only lead, silver, and copper, that&rsquo;s a specific bracelet is made for specific disease. Now a lightning rod is used in a house to offset the effect of lightning against it, the bracelet is used exactly in the same relationship to offset the biomagnetic breakdown of the body itself (inaudible). Now it has a buildup rate and a breakdown rate, the bracelet inhibits the breakdown rate (inaudible) and raises your heart tone, it&rsquo;s like a musical tone in an instrument. Now Yogananda had two bracelets he wore, specifically recommended by his Guru Sri Yukteswar, one like this without the stones, you&rsquo;ll find that he&rsquo;s the only one that has the stones done like this for a reason and one which was made specifically for a disease that he had in his kidneys made up of lead and silver and tin and the weight was over three ounces. The weight determines the tremendous reaction, the length determines the reaction, but also in India these bracelets were made in Kali Yuga or Piscean Age. Centuries ago Man did not realize that design played an important part in extending the frequency and raising the resistance of the bracelet, now in the Aquarian Age we come to discover this, that design plays a much more important part not only by length or weight or carat of the materials use, design is vitally important. So you&rsquo;ll notice a bracelet made in India or SRF is twisted like a cable, like a cord, these are flatted, they are flatted to raise their frequency higher and it acts on the basic principle like a plane trying to crack the sound barrier. Airplane was first design and went through 700 miles per hour, after a while they snapped in the air and the government didn&rsquo;t know why, come to find out it&rsquo;s not the plane&rsquo;s fault, it was design fault, it could not go through the g-forces properly. Now if your neck was designed to go from here right down to the shoulder, your neck would break off pretty soon, you head would fall off because the g-forces would affect it, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s necked in, that&rsquo;s why this part is wider than this part, equally true like a Coke bottle. Now in the process of experimenting and it&rsquo;s helped (inaudible) discovered this design as a means of raising the frequency. Now when I wanted to get the quantities and the measurements I wrote India and I wrote Yogananda, I could not get the information, no one just wanted to offer this information. Well for years I wanted a bracelet desperately and every time I would raise the money, something came along and I would have to use the money. So I said maybe there&rsquo;s a reason why I can&rsquo;t buy the bracelet, maybe there&rsquo;s a reason why I can&rsquo;t get the information, maybe God wants me to discover something about the bracelet that is not yet discovered. So the practice of experimenting and working with finally I discovered what was really wrong with both bracelets, the one made in India and the one made at SRF. They were both good but they&rsquo;re twisted, they&rsquo;re not flatted and they don&rsquo;t have the stones, this is the only difference. Now this stones becomes vitally important when I found out the reason for them, there is a bracelet that Master held, given to him by Yukteswar, had several stones built in it. Now it would be pretty expensive to make a bracelet with all the stones that are required so I found out that the basic stone on the bracelet that was really working to the effect in relation to the moon because that&rsquo;s the one that affects the the most was the coral and the basic bloodstone was the one that was essential, the others enhance certain aspects of your horoscope that does not help in offering a higher resistance rate to the magnetic field. So by changing the design and retaining the the two basic stones, I arrived at (inaudible) that performed efficiently (inaudible). Now these two were not made by myself, I gave the design and the information to a friend of mine to make them because I have not the time to do that but I could not turn over the (inaudible) to him because he was not an initiate, his son was an initiate but not the father, but the father was the one who had to make them. So I had to wait until they were made (inaudible) so you could imagine my frustration (inaudible). Now that I had the time to make them (inaudible) and they have to be made in seven days, three days before the full moon, the day of the full moon, three days after the full moon and that&rsquo;s it, you gotta work pretty fast because that is the only period where the frequencies are their highest and since we live on the earth, the frequencies (inaudible) and making the bracelet within that period with the (inaudible). It raises a heart tone because we have a friend who uses a radionic machine that indicates how the heart tone is raised. (Inaudible) 0:10 &hellip; working with toxic material so all around the bracelet is very black, now normally we take it off to wash it but if your body is really (inaudible), the bracelet will start to polish itself. Audience: Adano does the moon have a detrimental effect on health in any way? Adano: Yes. (Inaudible). We live on a planet and natural magnetism works all the time (inaudible), after awhile they build up a static charge and they start breaking down the metal (inaudible). They&rsquo;ve come to realize that metal is just as much alive as a human body, the scientists who work constantly formulating metals to make (inaudible) gas lines where the pipe is constantly under pressure with active energy, we have come to realize that you can&rsquo;t have too much magnetism (inaudible). So the Yogis for centuries have often said sleep with your head to the north and your feet to the south so that the natural motion of the earth would stabilize this movement in the body. (Inaudible), but the gold and silver has to be of a certain weight (inaudible). Now copper accumulates in this part of the brain (inaudible)&hellip; and various other precious metals have a tendency to accumulate in certain areas, these tendencies indicate something, though there is magnetic breakdown becomes more pronounced with the environmental action. So if the Sages (inaudible) and recognize that you can construct an armlet that can offset (inaudible), then you stay within your frequency till you arrive in your inner consciousness. I know from my own personal experience in my inner meditation when I go up the centers along the elliptical path from Aquarius, wherever there is a negative pull in my horoscope, the bracelet turns it off and the life current is recycled starts strengthen the positive aspect of those centers. Now we&rsquo;re not left alone by ourselves, we are in the house of the Masters, not too long ago while I was in California one night I was in between meditation and one of the Masters came and took his hand (inaudible), &ldquo;you have arthritis in leg and I&rsquo;ll take it out right now.&rdquo; Normally if it started to developed I would have to recycle the energy and I would check the bracelet over the inside of the body for a few days then I recycle. Now it will heal because I&rsquo;m overloading the carbohydrates in my body, I was not drinking sufficient water. So there are lots of things you&rsquo;ll discover later on as you go into your meditation, you&rsquo;re not left alone. The bracelet is important (inaudible). If you buy 12 inches of gold of a certain thickness and weight, by time you twist it you&rsquo;re not going to the circumference. (Inaudible). Now the regular size for the regular bracelet is 11 inches that&rsquo;s the regular measurement, now beyond that you have to compensate so that we have to make the compensation (inaudible). Usually when a woman is in her menstrual period, it should go on the left arm (inaudible)&hellip; Now if you find that you have an injury, before medical health comes to you take it off the right hand and put it immediately on the left side that will recycle the energy to prevent hemorrhaging, so immediately when medical help arrives then afterwards then show that their comprehensive work but these are emergencies. 0:20 No there are many people who want them who are not initiated but sometimes they don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s all for but sooner or later (inaudible) because an initiate is more aware of what it&rsquo;s all about (inaudible)&hellip; You have what is called a 36 hour safety factor, then the person starts cycling down, the heart tone starts coming down to what is called the norm so within 36 hours and you finally take it off you&rsquo;re still warm&hellip; No no I&rsquo;m at the same frequency in my body is holding it but at 36 hours it will start draining faster that means it starts going down in vitality. Remember when the woman touched Jesus on the hem of the garment, he used these words, &ldquo;Power has gone out of me&rdquo; but the new translation is &ldquo;virtue has gone out of me this body.&rdquo; (Inaudible) this body is a battery that is both charging and discharging, anabolic and catabolic from the metabolic principle, so when the normal breakdown rate begins from environmental pressure, then this goes fast. Now the primary purpose of regeneration is to offset that pull, to hold it in abeyance to give you (inaudible), so when you take that off you go back to the normal cycle where the body would be and then it starts to pull. Now if you&rsquo;ve built up enough reserve in yourself then you can offset it. Now in the past five years I&rsquo;ve been built up enough reserve through my meditation that I can actually take it off for a month without affecting me (inaudible) but one doesn&rsquo;t use up reserve just to prove a point (inaudible section then several minutes of group conversation). Audience: I&rsquo;ll tell you something interesting, my mother brought paper cups in from her pantry and she just brought in a stack of what she had and I counted them and there were 52 paper cups and when we served last night that&rsquo;s exactly how many we needed. Adano: Well there was some information you were supposed to copy on the bottom of it, did you copy it? Audience: Yeah. Adano: Well that&rsquo;s what I needed so I can read it out. (More group conversation). No, this is for the initiate&rsquo;s use. She couldn&rsquo;t let her husband know she had it so she hid it away in some corner till he&rsquo;s an initiate now. 0:30 Get one and write some information as I call it out. Now you see the word &ldquo;resentment,&rdquo; you put the word &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; under the word resentment on that particular line of the &ldquo;basic self.&rdquo; Under the word &ldquo;pride&rdquo; write the word &ldquo;ear.&rdquo; Resentment is eyes, that&rsquo;s the first line under the &ldquo;basic self&rdquo; and under pride write the word &ldquo;ears.&rdquo; Under &ldquo;criticism&rdquo; write the word &ldquo;mouth.&rdquo; Now under &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo; write the word &ldquo;nostrils.&rdquo; Under the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; write &ldquo;throat.&rdquo; Under &ldquo;dishonesty&rsquo; write &ldquo;heart.&rdquo; Under hypocrisy write kidney. Under self-pity write lungs. Under guilt write regenerative organs. Audience: Well we&rsquo;re all over 21 so we can write sex organs. (Laughter). Adano: Okay I&rsquo;m allowing for the 16 year old initiates. Under flattery write the word liver. Under jealous write the word hands. Under the word possessive write arms. Under the word worry write rectum or anus. Okay now in the corner you see 35 days resistance cycle or recycling cycle. The lower body is composed of 16 elements plus trace elements, that&rsquo;s the physical body, and the electrical body is composed of 19 elements and so let&rsquo;s identify the 19 elements and try to understand them. You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s one called ego, the second one is called intelligence, then feeling, then mind / sense-consciousness. Now we come to the five instruments of knowledge: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. Then we come to the five instruments of action: procreation, excrete, talk, walk, manual skill. And then we come to the five instruments of life force: crystallizing, assimilating, eliminating, metabolizing, circulating. This is very important to understand because it&rsquo;s the key to what Jesus did when he rebuilded the body from the atoms. He had to recycle these very idea patterns to build back the body, so you have to be conscious of this makeup, you have to be conscious of what directs this makeup and it has to be centered in your memory all the time, constantly think of it so that normally as you meditate and think of that movement of the energy going up the spine and down, these forces, these principles are constantly recycling themselves, they are correcting themselves and they&rsquo;re going to eventually respond to the thought pattern. &ldquo;As a Man think, that is what he is&rdquo; because the physical frame takes it&rsquo;s recycling from the electrical and the electrical takes its recycling from the composite or ideational, this is the basis of image therapy because right there we can go and start working upon ourselves and drawing and correcting. A Master doesn&rsquo;t perform no miracle, all he does is realign the mental image and infuse these very vital forces as they work through into the chemical structure. So you have the image of what you&rsquo;re working with and the memory of what these 19 elements are feeding through down into the physical or chemical, then the thought pattern is crystallizing. Is that clear so far? Okay, it takes 35 days to recycle. Now I received a letter asking for a 28-day recycling chart, therefore there was no 28 days recycling chart but then we&rsquo;re actually working to make it on a chart basis with the actual recycling that you want to do. 0:40 Now one of the ways to recycle is using water like a battery. Now Casey says and the Yogis says we should drink seven pints of water per day, right? Audience: They&rsquo;re going to say glasses, 8 ounce glasses? Adano: It&rsquo;s seven pints per day. Now, but they in India don&rsquo;t say like Mr. Casey because Mr. Casey doesn&rsquo;t say what type of water, but the Hindus have said &ldquo;water that the sun never shone on, filtered through certain pigments.&rdquo; So let&rsquo;s see what the water the sun never shone on is water that comes from under the ground, right? All right, if you put them in a filtered or in a container of different pigments such as a red container, an orange, a yellow, a green, a blue, a violet, and then a white and leave it into the sunlight now for 24 hours minimum then draw off from that and drink in this sequence every three hours or every two and a half hours&hellip; No, in 24 hours seven times would be three hours, fifteen minutes. Every three hours and fifteen minutes you drink one pint starting from one o&rsquo;clock at night: red orange yellow green blue violet indigo and white. Audience: What happens in the wintertime when the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine? Adano: Just a light. So you keep adding water before it goes down so you have enough to work with but you draw off that. Now this is done for 35 days. So in 24 hours you&rsquo;re drinking a pint from each one of those glasses, see? It&rsquo;s 35 day resistance cycle but this is the first process of cleansing the body to get it going, so it helps the holy breath. Audience: Distilled water, would that make any difference? Adano: Well distilled water does not have minerals, you want minerals and you want them to react electrically so this is what you want, spring water. You don&rsquo;t want water with chlorine or fluorine. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It won&rsquo;t make much of a difference because then the color is going to react what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, this is why you&rsquo;re leaving it 24 hours there before you use it, you&rsquo;re leaving it 24 hours in the colored glass before you use it. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes but that&rsquo;s a pretty expensive process unless you have the stones that you can put inside the glass and let the water react with the light in the stone. The stones are expensive unless you have a nice supply of stones like my friend Chief War Eagle, you can afford to put all the stones in the water but stones are good, basically the stones have the actually electrical frequency. Now not less than two carats so a big stone like this is more than two carats, the minimum, it&rsquo;s always got to be at least a two carat, that&rsquo;s where the frequency terminates, below that, it doesn&rsquo;t go below that, it&rsquo;s from two and a half up, below that there&rsquo;s no reaction. So if somebody&rsquo;s want to sell you a bunch of stones because they look beautiful and they&rsquo;re cheap, they&rsquo;re worth nothing. But it&rsquo;s uncut, don&rsquo;t polish them, they have to be in their natural state. Anyway this is a way of recycling by water. Now during that same period you can go through your fasting in recycling. So we got one week where we eliminate solids, we&rsquo;re using the puree form, not the concentrated solid of the food, just the puree form. The next week a liquid form. Let me put it this way, all right, let&rsquo;s say the first week, first seven days in recycling, if you are eating starches and vegetables, try to minimize the quantity of the starches and the vegetables for the first week, bring the quantity down slowly. Then the second week bring the fruits and nuts down slowly. The third week bring it into puree form, like a soup form. And the fourth week use it like a juice form. And the fifth week dilute it with water, dilute the juice with water. You got it? First like the starches and vegetables solid you reducing that down, very small quantities, the second week the fruits and nuts in a smaller quantity, and then the third week they&rsquo;re in a more of a puree form, the fourth week they&rsquo;re in a liquid juice form, strong, like a thick soup. And the fifth week they&rsquo;re diluted with more water so it&rsquo;s just the flavoring, this is recycling. Now if it&rsquo;s possible that you can get an enema during that period or a colonic during that recycling period, it&rsquo;s best to get it. 0:50 Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No, you don&rsquo;t want to do that till you finish all this cleansing process, then you can go back on that, because you got to come off of this process gradually, you work your way back up in consistency. The same way you came down, you work back up in consistency, it&rsquo;s a recycling, you&rsquo;re recycling this energy. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yeah you drink that water all the time during the 25 days. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: But then after 10 weeks you&rsquo;re back to the normal routine of eating from then on you should be able to go on the solar nutrition principles of living. You should be able now to eat fruits and nuts in the morning and it&rsquo;s preferable if you can grind them up then you don&rsquo;t do too much of a harsh mastication. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Chew them up, you need the saliva in it. Then you see in the middle of the day you should have your vegetables and in the afternoon you should have those fruits that grow on the vine or on the ground and in the evening time you have the vegetable grow under the ground, by that time your body is recycled. Now you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of pep, you&rsquo;re going to want to overwork, don&rsquo;t, take it easy, don&rsquo;t because this is a spear energy that is starting to build up, hold it in conservation, this will give you the ability to stay up for five or six days and talk. Now you know how they&rsquo;re doing it, no magic. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Right, afterwards, not during the first five weeks of recycling, afterwards. Audience: (Inaudible). Vitamins. Adano: Well those who want them, I get them in all the food and if there&rsquo;s a shortage then I supplement A B and C. B for vitality, brewer&rsquo;s yeast. You need C a lot because you&rsquo;re actually working your body a great deal that way and you do need C. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yesterday we were reading into what is called a life regenerative reading, comparing techniques. There is nothing new, in fact it confirms everything in the Casey writings, the body has to be cleaned up. The whole principle is in the body, it&rsquo;s the basis, anything that seems to go off stems from that basis in the body itself by not cleaning it up, the ideas that seem to create the stresses, you can track it down right back into the cell. So if you are doing the 35-day recycling, it will start showing up results. Now in Russia in treating schizophrenia, they put the patient on a 35-day non-meat protein diet. At the end of the 30th day they have seen remarkable results but they don&rsquo;t stop right away, they go the full 35 days because they realize the patient is already coming out of the protein is doing tremendous effect on his body, so they give him a non-meat diet, non-meat protein diet, and they are already coming to realize the solar nutrition way of feeding the patient, to give him the pulverized nuts in puree form like butter forms, the fruits in the morning, the vegetables in the middle of the day, and those that grow under the ground at night and they put them on a non-meat protein diet for the 35 day. Well also now they&rsquo;re adding the vitamins after the process is over and they have nearly 99 percent result. Now if this is only one of the mental cases they&rsquo;re working, imagine what the field of research is going into, the resistance cycling, the recycling process seems to come up exactly around 35 days, it has to go past a month plus seven days for the seven systems of the body. It&rsquo;s one rotation of the moon around the earth plus seven days for each system in the mechanism. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well for for my own personal use for years I used to do it twice a year and during that time I used to scrub my skin with sand. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No I got I got the sand from the desert, you can get it from the beach especially it&rsquo;s got impregnated with that lovely salt there, you couldn&rsquo;t get any better antiseptic and it&rsquo;s impregnated with water and scour your skin and that takes off the dead cells and act on this electrical nature. Now sand is silica which is like glass already, so it has a high electromagnetic effect on the cells to produce what is called the soft silky velvety skin you want. This is the transformation you find, the resurrected body is a soft smooth silky body, if you look at the pictures of the Masters, their skin, it&rsquo;s very soft and smooth and glows Ananda Swami is in his 80s and if you see he has the skin of a baby. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: In your hand, in a container. Well I had a basin from the desert, you see I lived in the desert and all I did was put a desert water in it and took it and scrub it on my body, my face and hair and everything, all through the body, just scrape it. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No, get yourself a plastic bag with the sand inside right, mix it into a basin of water so it&rsquo;s soft and loose. Now if you go in the bathtub and it&rsquo;s not practical because it&rsquo;s going to wash down and drain and keep spoil the bathtub so take an area where you can sit down like paper or something and then work on your body. In the desert I didn&rsquo;t have no peeping Toms so I had no problem with scouring the skin but most of the Saints were doing it in the desert, they thought they were there to run from society but they were doing a great science. This is a recycling and cleaning up of the cells. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It is wise to start when the moon begins again so you&rsquo;ll have the full flow of the moon, this is practical, this is very practical approach because then you&rsquo;re going with the full flow of the moon and I find the best time in the year is the spring equinox and the fall equinox, those are the two best periods. In spring we call a spring cleaning and fall cleaning, shedding, these are the two periods. 1:00 Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re taking medicine to cycle it. Now if you can, and I don&rsquo;t know how many people can, I know in the desert I couldn&rsquo;t, I use the heat of the sun to do it for me but if you can while I was in California I took advantage because I was staying in the place there, a hot shower hot enough that it&rsquo;s sprays are bombarding the body from this portion of the back right down to the hip for every ten minutes at least four times a day. Now I found this, in the short space of doing it, it&rsquo;s amazing observation coming back to the concept fountain of youth, you know fountain is where water is, youth is vitality or recycling / regenerating, this principle actually recycled my vitality, I was able to do the 12 hours very easily without any side effects and working with toxic (inaudible). So I realized the key that you can cycle this body again by the water and by heat at that particular area of the body by bombarding, not too much on the head or too much in the chest but just below from the middle of the back right down to the feet and if you bend forward and let the water hit you all the way down to the rectum, buttocks, and the thighs with that amount of pressure, hot enough that you can bear but don&rsquo;t burn yourself, but stay in it for about 10 minutes, four times a day, that would be morning and if you can get it in the afternoon&hellip; 35 days resistance cycle sometimes you have to pick out that period to do it so if you&rsquo;re doing it within a certain period&hellip; this is the primary need for the retreat, as a conservatory help for the initiate to go and go through the recycling process, that&rsquo;s why I call the retreat a spiritual garage. All right now we&rsquo;re coming to the apples in the initiation, for those who didn&rsquo;t bring their apples but for those who had their apples examined already, all four types of breaking down have been experienced here already. Audience: Four or five? Adano: No, the fifth one we haven&rsquo;t seen yet when I see the fifth one it will be different, I&rsquo;m looking for the fifth one too then I&rsquo;ll go and pay homage. Now the watery, squashy represents dissolve, it represents dissolve, so if I&rsquo;m not here and by the time it gets to that point those who are familiar with that it looks like we have seen it already, they can pinpoint it, that&rsquo;s the current to dissolve. Now the prayer goes like this, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will dissolve all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of this individual. It has been said, it is done.&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes this is what we&rsquo;re coming to now, the use of the healing prayer, yeah this is what we gotta come now so then we line up everybody. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will dissolve all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of this individual. It has been said, it is done, so be it.&rdquo; Om seven times. Now dissolve is watery, if it turns powdery, have anyone seen what powdery look like? I showed them last night what powdery would look like, someone brought one that was powdery, it looks like a green moss all over it, it&rsquo;s powdery, all covered, it&rsquo;s not squashy, it&rsquo;s powdery, that&rsquo;s the powdery that represents &ldquo;to eliminate.&rdquo; Now the same framework, you just remove the word dissolve and put eliminate, that is for those two frequencies, the framework of the prayer is the same. I&rsquo;ll go over the framework, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will dissolve, or eliminate either one of the two as you find them, all those conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of this individual. It has been said, it is done, so be it.&rdquo; Om seven times. Now for the next two frequencies, if the apple becomes shriveled up like we saw the other day, dry, no powdery, no water, but shriveled / wrinkled, that it that is to strengthen. So the framework of the prayer grows like this, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will strengthen all those conditions that are necessary for the normal and harmonious flow of the individual.&rdquo; Just a few words have been changed for the frequency. Now if the apple remains four or five months to a year or two years firm and not breaking down, that means to rebuild. Now we have a few of them already here so it means, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will rebuild,&rdquo; you just change strengthening put rebuild, the same framework, &ldquo;all those conditions that are necessary for the normal and harmonious&hellip;&rdquo; The framework is the same for two, the first two is the same you&rsquo;re just changing the words, the last two the framework is the same, so you won&rsquo;t have no problem really to remember it, is that clear so far? Now how do we set up a healing circle? The healing circle is broken down into three parts: occupation, health, mutual contact, you want to put them in the three categories now? They&rsquo;re broken down in this way: occupation, health, and mutual contact. 1:10 Now you take the names of the people who have need for health and you put it under health and those who have need for jobs you put it under occupation and those who have problems in between two human beings or a group of human beings put it under mutual contact. Let&rsquo;s make sure that we got it clear, mutual contact is to dissolve, occupation is strengthen, and health is to eliminate. All right the rebuilder is the only one that works all three backwards: the first is last and last is first, it&rsquo;s based on that principle of healing. You take the names, let&rsquo;s say Joe, Mary, and Ann are out of a job and you put that under occupation. Jim, Frank, and Eddie are ill, you put that under health. Lucy, William, and Don have an argument, can&rsquo;t resolve it, put it under mutual contact. Now the person who has the power frequency to strengthen, he reads strengthen, the person who has the power frequency of eliminate, reads eliminate, and the person who has a power frequency of dissolve, he reads dissolve you follow? Downwards, the names are read downwards however they come in for request, the person who is a rebuilder he takes all three and starts back up, backwards up, to rebuild, to eliminate, to dissolve, he has to do all three of them. So the rebuilder is the one who goes all around, his frequency works that way, he&rsquo;s the rebuilder, so let&rsquo;s say Joe, Mary, and Ann, this is a sequence of one, then for the rebuilder it&rsquo;s Mary, Joe, you see what I mean? It goes backwards and he reads the next one backwards but he reads last so that group of the rebuilders they read last and the group of the dissolvers, the eliminators, and the strengtheners, they read first but the rebuilder reads last and he read backwards all the time, this is the closing of the circuit in the energy. Now the thumb represents the earth energy, the forefinger represents water, the middle finger represents fire, the fourth finger represents air, and the little finger represents ether. Now in terms of the five frequencies the little finger represents dissolve, the last finger which is you call this fourth finger here, ring finger, represents eliminate, the middle finger represents to strengthen, the index finger represents to rebuild, and the thumb represents life over death. Now have you ever seen the artist conception of a Master doing this? This is the Boy Scounts, be prepared, (laughter) but that&rsquo;s that is locking of life and death to dissolve, the energies are locked in. So you&rsquo;ve ever seen figurines of the Indian paintings, they have different gestures, these are called the mudras. Now if a man ever or a woman ever saw Swami Muktananda or Paramhansa Muktananda, they think something is wrong with him, he&rsquo;ll be doing this like that most of the time, one person saw him and he says &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s the most restless individual I&rsquo;ve ever met, he calls himself a yogi.&rdquo; So she saw restlessness in these movements, the initiates saw different forces being released to the group in the room to eradicate karma. Fernando says he was a comical thing, one woman came to the retreat and she was an artist and everything and she studied yoga so much and she&rsquo;d been all over and here&rsquo;s Parmahansa Muktananda says now, you know how he likes to jiggle around, Laman says he has his own beat, he&rsquo;s singing way off key from all the rest. So the woman said to Kriyananda when he left, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the most restless man I ever seen and he calls himself a yogi.&rdquo; So Kriyananda says, &ldquo;You mean you did not understand the communication of the hand?&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;What communication, that restless individual doing like that?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well I knew whenever he did this with his fingers, I got the movement in my chakras,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;and then he did that to somebody in the air, they felt.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel nothing, all I felt was restlessness coming from him.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s true in a way but we&rsquo;ve seen him, you know we met him and my wife had a marvelous experience with him, I&rsquo;ll let her tell you. Audience: Well we found out he was in town and some Indian friends of ours and this is the one I told you all last night to know that (inaudible). Anyway she called us and told us he&rsquo;s gonna be in town but we couldn&rsquo;t go right then and we had to call and tell them if we were going to meet Muktananda or not (inaudible). So we got down there the next morning and he came in and said something to most of them and he sent him away except five of us: Adano, Lucille Curry, (inaudible). Audience: So he asked us some questions about the fellowship and the retreat and he said (inaudible). He&rsquo;s quite interested of course in Adano&rsquo;s swami name because his own guru&rsquo;s name is Nityananda. (Inaudible) I had the impression that we had been with him in the great cave temple in India. 1:20 Audience: Well anyway he got up left the room and we were sitting here meditating and he came back in and he stopped right behind me and for several weeks I had the most intense pain all in through here. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d done with this chakra or something but o&rsquo;brother. Anyway I had was praying for forgiveness for certain things and greater understanding and kind of correcting myself so I thought he was standing there possibly blessing us I wasn&rsquo;t looking at him, I had really been intent and so then I got the feeling that he was concentrating on me and I bowed my head at his feet and then I look up at him (inaudible)&hellip; Adano: These four are coming back, Ragananda, Chitananda, Mutkananda, and Ananda Swami, Satchitananda comes and goes all the time, but these four are coming back, they want to come to the retreat and spend time. Ok, we&rsquo;re going a little more into what we need to cover. The next thing we&rsquo;re covering is how you are lining up in the treating, you got that clear? In your own group, in your initiate group, now you you can take all the other names from the A.R.E. prayer group and realign it this way and work with it in the initiate healing time. So you can help those people by realigning it, you see people write in for our help but they don&rsquo;t specify what help they want. &ldquo;Please help me.&rdquo; What is it you want to do? Well by putting them in the three categories then you start working with them: occupation, health, mutual contact, and working with the specific charges to recycle it. The rebuilder has a specific role to do, he&rsquo;s not no more or less than the next person and don&rsquo;t think that because one apple breakdown faster than the other, that person is a sinful person or he&rsquo;s not as developed the other, totally erroneous idea, this has nothing to do with the frequencies. These are the frequencies that you&rsquo;re lined up to work with and it&rsquo;s better to know your own specific frequency linked to the Master than to have a blanket relationship to this consciousness and then still not positive what is going on inside. So once you&rsquo;re lined up then you&rsquo;re working effectively and as a group working so this is better to have it that way. So you can take the names of people who hand in their names for help, now don&rsquo;t forget to put down your own name. Initiates pray for initiates and in fact your prayer list should constitute all the names of the initiates, there is no initiate who thinks that is beyond the help of the other initiates, including myself, pray for me, I need it badly. Audience: What category do you want to be in? (Laughter). Adano: The group names can be put in, they should be put in. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You need it, you need it in your health, you need it in your social contact, and you need it in your occupation. Now if you pray for yourself there&rsquo;s only one person praying, if you got a group of 40 people praying for you ain&rsquo;t that better than get your ego out of the way? That&rsquo;s 40 times faster in your favor because you&rsquo;re contributing as a 40th portion for one person in that group, you would be one of the 40 that is praying for the next week in fact if there are 40 people you&rsquo;ll be praying for 39 and even though you repeat your own name because it&rsquo;s in your own frequency, that is only to establish identity but not to establish ego. If your name is under health and you repeat your name Adano, this is just to establish identity but you go on to the rest because you&rsquo;ll be praying for them and they in turn will only establish their identity when they pass through their own name. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes the initiate group should be under all three lists, this is to ensure the group building their own spiritual and emotional and financial, you can&rsquo;t just struggle along like that, you need the help just as much as others needed and the Masters are there but heaven help those who help themselves and Yogananda put it this way, &ldquo;You do 25 percent of the work, the Masters will do 25 percent of the work, God will meet you the halfway mark, 50 percent of His work.&rdquo; So God is going to do 50 percent, the Masters are going to do 25, we got to do 25 percent, that rounds it out. So if we make the effort to include ourselves with others just to establish identity, then there is no ego but at the same time you are cycling this energy because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for in the first place, to build it up. Now &ldquo;if you can find ten righteous thinking men, I will not destroy the city,&rdquo; so who are the ten righteous men? The initiates, molding and growing, they set off the waves in the atmosphere, where ever initiate goes, he is the light. So when you go to the prayer meeting up at A.R.E. you are the light, you&rsquo;re carrying light, you go to Unity you&rsquo;re the light, you go to any church you are the light now because they need help just as much as you but you are light because you (inaudible), go pray for them. Prayer is the great privilege in body and the Soul at creation to commune with God. Prayer is the great privilege embodied in the Soul to commune with God, it&rsquo;s cheaper than any other method I know of. You know prayer can heal us instantaneously change or alter our problems, don&rsquo;t cost us no money, it&rsquo;s cheaper than drugs, any questions so far? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Now when you&rsquo;re treating if you&rsquo;re gonna treat now for using a proxy treatment if you want to put the chair in the center what you call the proxy treating, you raise the left hand where the current enters and you place your right hand on the person or the proxy and that&rsquo;s how the current is delivered. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Now when that is finished there is an initiate healing for all life and it&rsquo;s done this way, everyone is going to repeat his own specific charge, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will eliminate or will strengthen or will dissolve or will rebuild, the vital powers.&rdquo; Audience: Could you repeat that again? 1:30 Adano: &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will eliminate or will dissolve&rdquo; and for that frequency you are eliminating and dissolving the unnecessary vital powers that surround the elemental kingdom, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, the human kingdom, the spiritual kingdom. Now those who are strengthening and rebuild will say, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will strengthen or will rebuild all those vital powers that are necessary for the elemental kingdom, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, the human kingdom, and the spiritual kingdom.&rdquo; So you see how balance is maintained? You remove and you restore, you always remove and restore to maintain balance. Now when you come to the human kingdom those who are eliminating and dissolving, these are the parts you want to infer in the human kingdom, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will eliminate or dissolve all those vital powers that interfere with those who are being born, those who are being passing over&hellip;&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: This is uh something you&rsquo;re doing every time you get together for the human kingdom in a specific way. For those who are being born, for those who are passing over, for those who are reincarnating, for those who are resurrecting, for those who are ascending, and for those who are manifesting you are eliminating and dissolving those conditions that interfere. Now those who strengthen and rebuild will do the opposite, divine will flowing through them or through me, will rebuild or strengthen all the vital powers necessary for those being born, for those who are passing over, for those who are reincarnating, for those who are resurrecting, for those who are ascending, and for those who are manifesting, in this way you have balance. Now this is what they call the Sattvic life of the initiate. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yeah you do the OMs seven times at the end of it you see, but this action is called action necessary for the continuity of life, this is what you call the silent helper, the silent helpers are the oness or the initiates who perform the action or are their brother&rsquo;s keepers truly performing the actions that are necessary for the continuity of life. They see that life continues all the time, they&rsquo;re radiating it to all the levels and especially in the human kingdom where they have to go through birth, death, reincarnation, resurrecting, ascending, and manifesting, each one needs help because they in turn will help you. You know when you&rsquo;re resurrecting yo,u need help too Jesus said to Mary, &ldquo;Touch me not, I&rsquo;ve not gone to the Father.&rdquo; You still need help, so there are other forces working to help so this is to make you aware of how you&rsquo;re treating all the time specific, not in blanket scattered, the energy is not scattered it&rsquo;s directed, channeled. So let me go over it again, to eliminate, to dissolve, is to remove the unnecessary conditions that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow the individual, you get the picture? To strengthen and to rebuild is to reinforce the necessary normal and harmonious flow of the individual because you have both you see, you have anabolic and catabolic and as the doctor would say, you have a metabolism, a breakdown rate and a build up rate, and there&rsquo;s a peculiar thing with prayer, if you pray for a person and healing him and one part ascending and the other part is also balanced, sooner or later the disease starts coming back and some people pray and the disease multiply, you ever hear about that? Another prays and the disease stop so this is the conflict in prayer, to eliminate that conflict of overlapping we set them up in their right category, in the right frequency, that the initiate is strictly working, he knows which one is his. So if you are a dissolver and you are praying for Mary Jones for her to get well and you say, &ldquo;Dear Lord please help Mary Jones, Thy will be done,&rdquo; you might dissolve what is essentially good for Mary Jones at the same time in the extreme reconstruction period you see but if you&rsquo;re specifying it because the conscious mind and subconscious mind work together, you specify &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will dissolve all those conditions that interfere,&rdquo; not the good ones, that interfere with the normal and harmonious flow of the life principle you see in the individual whereas then those who are praying as the rebuilders now they are saying now, &ldquo;Divine will flowing through me will rebuild all those conditions that are necessary now,&rdquo; that will start to strengthen and rebuild that for the normal and harmonious flow of the individual that brings about polarity. That&rsquo;s why when Jesus sends out His disciples, He sends them out in pairs. So He had to have them lined up of one of the two camps, either an eliminator with a strengther or a dissolver with a rebuilder, He had have to have some polarity between the two of them to work because He would know exactly. If there were two eliminators or two dissolvers and no rebuilders it wouldn&rsquo;t balance out, so the laws on these forces are working and your apple is a good way to keep track, you have the measurements to work with. Now as you start working in your healing group work, you&rsquo;ll see how effective your consciousness is, Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You use your specific charge, then you call up everybody else and keep the person in thought. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: The Masters are going to work too you know so the Masters they have what is called this, that means all five are working for them. 1:40 So when they can do that and they wipe it all off like a stroke. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Have you got the one of these charts? They have to put some information at the bottom of them. Alright coming back to the Holy Breath, any questions about the Holy Breath? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: (Demonstrates the Holy Breath). Audience: Seems to be almost no movement of the abdomen. Adano: No strain, I look like I&rsquo;m sleeping but I&rsquo;m conscious. Audience: And you&rsquo;re inhaling through the nose? Adano: Through the mouth and exhaling through the mouth, you must always do three to get one registration, so a demonstration requires three breaths all the time for the registration. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Start all over again as long as you get 12 registrations. Audience: Is the inhalation the same as exhalation? Adano: The same amount of time, if you want to count it which is not practical, they used to teach that way counting it but you get fouled-up in counting. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No the one that you fall off if you yawn in the middle of it just go over it and do it. If you start to yawn stop and then start again, you got whole day to do the thing. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You&rsquo;re doing 14 to get 12 so some people like to count how many times. If you&rsquo;re gonna count one two three four then you can&rsquo;t breathe, is that practical? So let the thing come natural up without strain till it comes right to the top of the skull and then go back down like a thermometer, inside of a thermometer. Audience: You don&rsquo;t hold it between breaths? Adano: If you hold it, in some people&rsquo;s cases it seems like gives them a pressure and then they don&rsquo;t want to do it, so the wisest thing is to come up to the maximum height you come and then let it come back down natural, in its own natural rhythm it will do its own resolving in there but you can get pretty bogged down in the technique to come up and hold it for so much, go down and hold it for so much, you can get pretty bogged down and never really do the thing then you&rsquo;re doing it mechanically, you&rsquo;re not doing it with love. The motion is one of love and one of consciousness and one of feeling so it becomes a natural sigh of the body but your conscious just as you would sigh when you sound asleep, the way you&rsquo;re sound asleep and you breathe, so that this becomes a natural rhythm in consciousness not out of consciousness. See one of the readings we were looking yesterday, this is a peculiar part of the Holy Breath that was mentioned by Casey, it&rsquo;s in mind to spirit, the thing must be done in mind, in consciousness, to Spirit, to that Divinity. So Mr. Casey was well aware of what he was talking about and the Sages are saying the same thing, it is a natural flow up and come down, natural, don&rsquo;t fight it, let it become natural up but remember conscious not unconscious because the body does this itself. So he said, &ldquo;in the body itself it will take care of itself,&rdquo; it will lift itself off by itself. So if he says this already and the Yogis are saying identically the same thing, so you realize that you don&rsquo;t have to rush this thing, let this thing come naturally up and come down. Audience: But sometimes it won&rsquo;t stay here. Adano: Yeah there are times when it&rsquo;ll come and you can&rsquo;t come down so don&rsquo;t fight it, that&rsquo;s where you want it to stay up. Now Yogananda said this, &ldquo;If you can gentle gentle gentle gentle gentle gentle gentle gentle move the breath from the base of the spine to the head in one registration, you can have cosmic consciousness permanently.&rdquo; You know how many times he repeat &ldquo;gentle?&rdquo; Seven times, gentle gentle gentle gentle gentle gentle. It&rsquo;s so gentle so effortless in one registration he said it can stay there and give you permanent cosmic consciousness. So it is not how fast you do it, it&rsquo;s not how long you do it, it&rsquo;s not how many you think some people&hellip; I did like myself you know says &ldquo;oh if I can do uh 14 in the morning, 14 at night seven in the middle of the day that&rsquo;s 29 years, boy I can speed it up and make it to 98 years in one day.&rdquo; I did them and it didn&rsquo;t work, you you can&rsquo;t cheat on this thing, you only cheat yourself. There is a certain quantity you start with till the body builds up its own cycling. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Alright within the first 15 minutes take your time to do it, to do it within the first 15 minutes of the meditation and give yourself enough time to relax with it. All right after the first 15 minutes of your meditation then the second 15 minutes should be the Holy Name, do we all know the Holy Name? Is any doubt in repetition and pronouncing it in your mind. Audience: Where did I get the impression that we&rsquo;re only supposed to repeat the Holy Name seven times? Adano: No, there&rsquo;s no such thing. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: If you repeat it accidentally by saying it with your tongue you want to hollow it back repeat it mentally seven times. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;Hallowed be Thy name&rdquo; and Moses says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take the name in vain.&rdquo; Now you can&rsquo;t take the name in vain if you don&rsquo;t know the name and the only way you can do it in vain is by an oral action, that is the mouth you see. Audience: Can you sort me out on the counting of the Holy Breath? Adano: Fourteen in the morning. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You do three breaths, first one doesn&rsquo;t count, the last breath don&rsquo;t count&hellip; Audience: I do 14 sets of three? Adano: No no you do fourteen to get twelve. The first and last would never register but if you do 14 you will get 12. Audience: (Inaudible). 1:50 Adano: You see you asked me to demonstrate it, if I&rsquo;m demonstrating it, the first and last one to walk one registration, how many breaths would I have to do for one registration, if I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate it? Audience: The minimum. Adano: It&rsquo;s three but you don&rsquo;t count it that way for the 14, your 14 is considered already the first and last don&rsquo;t register. So you do 14 and get 12, you do three to get one as a demonstration, well if I was going to join you in the group and let&rsquo;s do it now, let&rsquo;s do 12 registrations, you know how many breaths you gotta do now? Just remember this.. well I&rsquo;m glad you brought the question up because this is important, here&rsquo;s the question, what is the importance of breathing through the mouth versus breathing through the nostril? You are 80 percent what? Water, all right the life energy originated in cellular form where? Water, all right. Now it has a direct contact to the brain because the brain is composed of what? Cells, the amoeba, so this is direct contact by the mouth, not by the nostril, so when you swim do you breathe through your nose or breathe through your mouth? You breathe through your mouth because that&rsquo;s a direct contact and it&rsquo;s diaphragmatic at the same time because that&rsquo;s way down in the basic part of the body. So for that reason you have a direct feedback from the base of the spine to the brain through the spinal column to send the energy up faster, therefore by breathing through the mouth you are drawing directly. Now when you sleep if you watch a person when they sleep and how they breathe they&rsquo;re actually drawing it through their mouth but they&rsquo;re unconscious, they are sighing, and they&rsquo;re gonna to snore, and as I said last night snoring is (inaudible) realization because Yukteswar snored so deep that Yogananda couldn&rsquo;t figure it out why till he came a point where he didn&rsquo;t snore no more and he thought he was dead. That&rsquo;s when he got into realization, when the body shut off. With the nearest frequency you have to go with the mouth till you come to that almost like a snore and flip in. Some people when they meditate you may see them sleeping and snoring but they are not go flipping in, when you sleep in meditation you&rsquo;re not flipping in, don&rsquo;t fool yourself that when you sleep in meditation you&rsquo;re flipping in, it&rsquo;s not, in meditation you don&rsquo;t want to sleep, in meditation this breath will shut off itself naturally and your consciousness will go in, so it&rsquo;s a breath with the mouth not the nostril. So if you find yourself (Adano makes a snoring sound) in meditation doing like that you&rsquo;re not flipping into consciousness, you are drifting away, therefore don&rsquo;t sleep in meditation, don&rsquo;t drift into that state because you&rsquo;re reproducing conditions that the body is accustomed to when it&rsquo;s asleep and you don&rsquo;t want that, you&rsquo;re leaving yourself open to the downward pull of the consciousness to the lower centers. So it is an upward pull and through the mouth and is very slow and it&rsquo;s a direct flow or direct feedback to the brain. Now it&rsquo;s not through the nostril, it&rsquo;s through the mouth, the main reason is because of direct feedback and because you&rsquo;re 80% liquid, it&rsquo;s like a filtering system like a battery, it has a direct feedback like an electronic action in a battery, so it&rsquo;s not the nose, it&rsquo;s the mouth. Audience: I think a lot of people were concerned about this because a Swami came through here a few weeks ago (inaudible) and advised us to breathe through the nose. (Inaudible). Adano: The Sau Hong exercise, or Hong-Sau as you know it, which only means &ldquo;I am He&rdquo; is done by breathing through the nose, it&rsquo;s not done by through the mouth. Now Sau Hong anybody can have that and that has been tossed around in China to India and back and forth for the past thousands of years. It was the only technique that Buddha brought, it was a technique that created the Buddha because that&rsquo;s the secret of the golden flower, it&rsquo;s the technique but Soham is through the nose, it&rsquo;s not through the mouth. Now Soham will relax you, it will bring you into a state of relaxation or attunement but it will not recycle the energy in your body and it will not expand the consciousness and will not speed up the evolution of the individual, it will only identify the individual with itself. Audience: Well thanks for clearing me up on that. Adano: So that&rsquo;s why you can have Soham. You see when I lecture their yogic principles or yogic techniques for meditation, I taught you this Soham which is a natural breathing through the nose, that was for the general public. Soham is for the general public, this what we&rsquo;re doing is for the initiates only because this is called the Holy Breath and it&rsquo;s not through the nose, it&rsquo;s through the mouth. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Okay now a person is not initiated under no circumstances if he&rsquo;s not given this, at the end of whatever money he pays for his initiation. No matter what he pays for his initiation, if he does not get this technique he&rsquo;s not initiated. Yes? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes you press on the right ear, on the right side. There was a man who heard the sound current on the left ear and he struggled for 10 years to shift it to the right side till he heard it on the right side. There&rsquo;s a reason for it, the downward current and you&rsquo;re hearing these sounds within you and if it&rsquo;s on the left side it has a tendency to pull you in the lower chakras where the lower tendencies, the animosities, all vibrate and come up and if you listen to it there you are trapped like the sailors who listen to the sirens and Odysseus plugged up their ears. Well this is the reason why the Masters sometimes block it out, that you don&rsquo;t hear anything or see anything, but you all of a sudden find yourself going into suspension, gradually it will shift over to this side, you want it to be on this side. Eventually you will discover that the sound is coming from here, that when you look inside you&rsquo;re actually hearing it here all the time and you&rsquo;re seeing it in the form of light pulsating like a metronome but until you arrive there you don&rsquo;t know and you can&rsquo;t work with it, so learn to listen here because this is the energy that&rsquo;s going this way, it&rsquo;s cycling this way already, so try to listen to it in this side, yes? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes, but you&rsquo;re going to go beyond the pulse because there&rsquo;s a higher pitch frequency beyond it and you&rsquo;ll hear it. All right there&rsquo;s a man that tells me that he hears the bells ringing in the past two weeks since I met him and I came here last time and he wasn&rsquo;t an initiate but he heard these bells ringing the first night I walk in the room and he thought something is wrong with his ears but since that time so he&rsquo;s going to go to the doctor to get it cut out. I said, &ldquo;Man you are lucky, I&rsquo;ve been struggling for nine years to get it to sound in my ears and you were hearing the bells so easy&rdquo; and but he was hearing bells actually ringing cowbells in different tones and frequencies but he was hearing it in the right ear. 2:00 So this is what I&rsquo;m trying to point out, some of us are there already. Now this is just to help you to hear it and react to it so that is very important in your initiation to lock into. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fight it, enjoy it, stick with it. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No both ears and if you get something to prop up, it&rsquo;s good to prop it up so that you don&rsquo;t get tired, so prop your hands up. Normally what you should do if you have someone in the group here who is a carpenter, take two pieces of board, small, two by one or one by two, you know piece of board and say about 24 inches long and about 18 inches high and nail a nail through it and then pad it and make a cross arm, it&rsquo;s a meditation prop for meditation. This is actually what we call listening to the Sound Current, God, all the time, tuning i. Now we can&rsquo;t see the radiant form or go further beyond that until we hear this, the radiant form doesn&rsquo;t come in until we hook up to the frequency, so the radiant form will start coming in. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Don&rsquo;t worry, just keep going, you will eventually master it, be patient with the thing. How does a Saint or Master gain patience? He doesn&rsquo;t gain it by somebody dropping on the head, he spent hours practicing. Some young people today they have taken ear plugs, devised ear plugs to lock their ears out and practice, you want you can do that, put some cotton wool, do like Odysseus in the sailor&rsquo;s ears, put cotton wool, do something to block out but here is more practical. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: The Sages knew what they were doing, they recognized the natural methods that the body was organized to work with and they just work with them, so that is what it is. Now let&rsquo;s do the holy breath 14 times (meditation).</p>
<h2 id="1968-november-2---part-1-spirit">1968 November 2 - Part 1 Spirit</h2>
<p>Adano68_11_02_1Vol1SpiritQ1RRNW6 - So many people come to hear a bunch of nothing from a guy like me. So how is everybody doing? Audience: Did you bring all the rain? Adano: Well Divine Mother wanted to wash the farmers out I guess. No the rain is important, I left Gretna you know, New Orleans is pretty warm, then on the way in coming through Dallas saw the clouds and I figure I&rsquo;m gonna get some rain. Let&rsquo;s just calm the mind for a second. (Meditation). The mind has a tendency to drift because this is natural. You&rsquo;ll find it wants to drift to an ideas concerning the past and by its own mechanics, it will generate frustration. Then the mind would want to shift and concentrate on an idea concerning the future and by its own mechanics this will generate anxiety but if the mind stays on an ID (idea) concerning Now, the present, the fact that you are, you exist, by its own mechanics you begin to feel peace. (Meditation). Slowly open the eyes but don&rsquo;t move try to adjust back to the environment as you bring the mind out through the eyes. Thank you. 0:10 Meditation is actually a direct approach to your inner self, no one can do it for you and the results are self-evident after practicing it. One, there is inner peace. Two, the inner knowledge that comes with it. Three, the inner strength that comes with it and then there are some unspoken powers that follow as a result of it but the first three are very important. In the environment in which we live in, peace is very hard to find after so much conflict and daily activity and no tranquilizing tablet can do it for us so if we can find a way to shut down this mechanism that is involved with the environment and revitalize ourselves, we&rsquo;ve got something. Every religion, every scriptural writing lay emphasis on this one particular approach but like every word that we know of pertaining to meditation or any idea pertaining to it, it is so misleading that we really don&rsquo;t know what meditation is, in fact the word meditation is a result of many words put together by the Sages. See the Sages were masters of word puzzles, they knew how to hide a complete science in one word just as we would hide now many names in one word like we have NASA National Aviation Space Aviation, these are words put together, meditation is exactly the same. M stands for mental, E stands for energy, this is mind and energy at work all the time, it is evident to you all the time that you are dealing with mind or consciousness and energy, and mind and energy are always moving, it&rsquo;s never stagnant, that&rsquo;s why it fluctuates from past to present to future. So we have MED already Mind Energy Direction, but this is an individualistic science, &ldquo;I,&rdquo; I cannot meditate for you and you can&rsquo;t for me, it&rsquo;s obvious, it&rsquo;s a do-it-yourself process. There is no broker between you and the Creative Intelligence, you are the Creative Intelligence already locked up in yourself and meditation is a method of unlocking this Creative Intelligence, so it&rsquo;s individualistic. T represents thought and A represents activities, so we have mind energy directing individual thought activities, you&rsquo;re confronted with this from the very start of the practice of meditation as an experience, you&rsquo;re struggling with it, you are struggling with ideational functions, thought action, but these thought actions move also for a purpose, they move towards &ldquo;T,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo; again intuitive, that means independent of your senses, the man who meditates eventually achieves extrasensory perception, an awareness that transcends the five senses right to the very core of the atomic structure, he knows that he knows now. &ldquo;O&rdquo; observation and oneness, that&rsquo;s why we say meditation is twofold, with seed or without seed, many books have been written on the subject as to say &ldquo;with seed&rdquo; that means it&rsquo;s an object that you concentrate on, &ldquo;without seed&rdquo; there&rsquo;s no object. It really means &ldquo;O,&rdquo; an extra sensory observation and an extra sensory oneness. &ldquo;N&rdquo; noumena, not phenomena, God, not a person, conscious reality, self. It brings peace and awareness, strength, and above all devotion. Now the last part is very hard, we can generate blind devotion and become fanatics but genuine devotion can only come through knowledge and knowledge of the universe we live in. Now when you are devoted to this knowledge, there is a transformation occurring within you, there is a gradual change occurring within the structure, then we can go back and validate the scriptures from meditation. Scriptures state of all religions that the human body is the temple of the living God and we look at it with disgust at times and ask ourselves how can this be the temple of the living God but our comprehension of the living God and the temple is what makes for the disgust, the realization makes for the appreciation. Until we realize what this really is, we cannot have devotion for God yet. To destroy it, to break it up without knowing what is involved leads us to a state of ignorance, that is ignoring the laws of creation but the moment we begin to investigate into its structure and its nature by its inherent forces, there is a wisdom that comes down into the consciousness permanently, it&rsquo;s never lost no more that is being revealed that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;revealed,&rdquo; no one can give it to you, the knowledge is revealed from within you by the meditative process, so we see it&rsquo;s a very very marvelous exposure for anyone to be with people who meditate. Jesus once said when he was in the body, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst.&rdquo; Now how many of us comprehend &ldquo;two or three gathering in my name?&rdquo; We can give lip service but as far as a personal experience is involved, this is entirely different because if we are attempting to experience that particular statement, we will discover something we&rsquo;ve never discovered before about ourselves. We&rsquo;re going to be exposed for the first time to levels of consciousness and planes of existence and depths of knowledge not possible from books and not possible by thinking, it&rsquo;s involved an extra sensory nature now. 0:20 &ldquo;The things I do you shall do also&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and lesser things shall you do, not better than me.&rdquo; Did He say that? No he said, &ldquo;greater things shall you do&rdquo; proving that He made you his equal and gave you a higher evaluation of yourself, God, by proving to us that we are God as manifested. I am not God but God manifest and became us, it&rsquo;s the difference, He has proven that by saying, &ldquo;The things I do you shall do also and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; Now if he had said anything outside of that then we can say He was the only son of God, then we would be caught in the verbal trap of language from translations and interpretations of what was meant in the meditative science but since we know by meditation that the Christ in Man is a cosmic light present here, and exists independent of our five senses, then it is possible to verify for each one of us the reality of the Master Jesus and the true meaning of His words from within ourselves. We can have an experience of it and the very things He said that He did, we can do also and if greater things are required of us it is done also depending upon the evolution or the need. Now anything that the Master has done, there was a need, it&rsquo;s never done for show, there is no three ring circus, if you look into just the life of Jesus there were always present the need, not the want, and the emphasis on looking inside. Meditation brings us right there at the start to look inside, Jesus said that &ldquo;Seek first the kingdom of God which is within you.&rdquo; Now this is a very good statement until we begin to experiment with it, it is not so good, because you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s inside of you and if you knew what&rsquo;s inside of you, you may not want to investigate, you see? So also if you know what&rsquo;s inside of you, you may want to investigate, it&rsquo;s a quite a tricky thing to seek the kingdom of God which is within you. Now he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;seek God which is within you,&rdquo; if he had said &ldquo;seek God which is within you&rdquo; there would be a difference and if he said, &ldquo;seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you.&rdquo; Now another Master put it this way he said, &ldquo;Everything else can wait but the search for God cannot,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the same as you say &ldquo;Man know thyself,&rdquo; the emphasis is back here. Nothing new has been taught by the Sages, it&rsquo;s the same thing, the greater emphasis today is HOW to look in here, we don&rsquo;t know how to look inside, no one is going to come along and says &ldquo;this is the way to look inside&rdquo; because we have no guarantee that is the way to look inside but if we have the qualifications that go from looking inside and if these qualifications are transferable. Now Jesus once said, &ldquo;By the fruits you shall know them,&rdquo; if this transferable condition is possible, how to look inside, then we can all make the effort to look inside ourselves. Now one of the first things we observe by looking inside is peace, I do not say that you will find miracles because I haven&rsquo;t found any yet but I know it exists. I do not perform any but I&rsquo;ve seen them happen. Now Jesus said &ldquo;the peace I give the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t found outside of myself through my five senses any possible way for this mechanism to become peaceful and if the Master Jesus said to look inside, then I had to make an attempt to go inside. I would not guarantee you that the first 10 minutes I achieved anything, in fact I&rsquo;ve been meditating nearly over 30 years now and it&rsquo;s a slow process, you can&rsquo;t plant a mango and eat it tomorrow or plant an orange and eat it tomorrow, it takes that much time by nature. You cannot acquire overnight peace let alone realization overnight, this is a process, you only work into it by slow methodical action. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;take up your cross and follow me,&rdquo; not the man Jesus, &ldquo;lift up your consciousness and research into yourself the me, the real self, lift it up.&rdquo; See it&rsquo;s easy for the five senses to stay outside because every condition from the environment generates emotions, very little from this environment can generate devotion, it was never intended for the environmental world through the five senses to generate devotion. What was intended from the environment is to generate emotion to pull you out, to keep the consciousness crystallized or involved, localized, and then set up arguments, debates and finally hit each other on the head, very little is left for you to go inside now and evaluate. So in poetical language or in the language of the time of Jesus, &ldquo;all ye that travail and are heavily laden, come unto me and I&rsquo;ll refresh you.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s one way of saying it, &ldquo;come let us look inside now, forget the environment, you&rsquo;re struggling with it, let&rsquo;s look inside. The I AM in you will refresh you&rdquo; that is to say &ldquo;all right, I shut off for a moment, I came on a long journey which involved an airplane and cars and so forth, I&rsquo;m shutting it out. It&rsquo;s travail, it&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s an involvement with my five senses, how can I refresh myself, where do I go to refresh? Do I take an Alka Seltzer or do I take a tranquilizer or a coke or shot of gin or do I go to bed or do I go into myself for the first time and observe this mechanism, what makes its function&rdquo; and we are confronted with the horrible fact that when we go in what is so obvious to us that we take very little notice of is that we breathe and we take it for granted that we breathe. Yet the scripture says &ldquo;God breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; Man did not become a living body or a living mind or a living spirit, he became a living Soul. So Man is Soul already but Man does not accept that, Man thinks he has a Soul and he go wrong continuing searching for the Soul and eventually he will search right where he started back, breath. After all the struggles from outside and finding no solution, nature by its own mechanics brings us back here. 0:30 Now we&rsquo;re not supposed to alter this breath or interfere with this breath, we&rsquo;re supposed to realize something about it, that&rsquo;s a big difference of trying to realize it or trying to alter it, anyone tells you to alter your breathing or to force it in order to live, you can tell them it&rsquo;s highly unscientific and it&rsquo;s untrue and none of the scriptures ever point out that you have to alter or interfere with the principle of life, which is breath. What is pointed out in the scriptures as a tangible experience it&rsquo;s a self-observation that Man is the living breath and the living breath is the audible lifestream which is the conscious. Now this consciousness has colors all of its own and certain sounds of its own and in meditation you see these colors and you hear these sounds and the colors have certain qualities and the sounds also have certain qualities. Master Jesus said &ldquo;If the eyes are single, when thine eye is single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; Now light is also a result of color you know, you break it up and you have color, that&rsquo;s how we know it&rsquo;s a composition, it&rsquo;s colors. Now when you go inside here to meditate you will see a light, some of us are fortunate some are not right away, this has nothing to do with the intelligence giving one priority over the other, nothing of the sort, this is strictly your level of evolution within yourself, it&rsquo;s just like the wattage of a bulb. Some bulbs are 10 watts, 100 watt, 50 watts, that&rsquo;s the way they made them but they will all light up nevertheless. Now this is at the level of consciousness you&rsquo;re at in yourself, now some of us may not see the light right away but may hear those sounds right away and some of us may not hear the sounds right away but may see the light right away and some of us may not see light but may see the breaking up of the light and the colors which they represent and some of us may not only hear the sound but they may hear the distinct types of sounds depending again on the level of evolution you&rsquo;re at. Now those sounds have often been referred to as the music of the spheres and the colors that we see inside, which is the light, represents God. Now all the scriptures of every nation or group of people who have ever attempted to write something about God ended up saying that God was light, never could say He had form and that God was sound. Now the best statement ever laid out by a great Saint was John who said &ldquo;In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt in Man.&rdquo; Now the question is &ldquo;what is word?&rdquo; We all know word is sound again and sound is vibration, you can only experience it by meditation. Now in the deepest states of prayer, if you want to say prayer or affirming a thought in your consciousness to the exclusion of every other thought which borders on almost what we try to achieve in meditation, that is a centering of your mind in the present, not on something concerning the past or the future, you will hear those sounds again. So some people who have prayed very deeply have often heard these sounds also they have often seen these colors and thought something was wrong with their ears or something wrong with their eyes not knowing that they were experiencing the reality of themselves. Yet at the same time they were convinced in the affirmation of the idea that the deity was listening to them. Now this is no blasphemy or disregard for the deity, understanding what the deity is and trying to put a label on what deity is. God is reality already, He has become us and the fact that matter, consciousness, energy, all locked up in one, the purest consciousness, the purest energy, crystallized as the purest form, matter. Now this realization is a challenge to our thinking today, why? Because of the imprinting of environment and the education of the environment, it challenges us to think and to accept the reality of ourselves, we can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s too harsh a pattern to look upon ourselves and say &ldquo;this weakling carries a God-self? This vehicle can do something that is supposed to be Godly?&rdquo; When every attempt turns out to some form of failure but there is a purpose behind that, it is to teach us humility and to teach us understanding, that&rsquo;s why Jesus would say if he was standing in this room, &ldquo;The things I cannot do by myself, I myself can do nothing,&rdquo; he says or do anything, &ldquo;but the spirit which is within me,&rdquo; there is the difference, what is the spirit, where is the spirit, how comes the spirit, where is the spirit going from? &ldquo;But the spirit which is within me&rdquo; or the Father which is within me, another name for the positive principle, &ldquo;doeth everything.&rdquo; Now this is a challenge to us because we cannot experience this challenge until we meditate, we cannot match this consciousness yet until we meditate or start to stabilize our five senses, we get glimpses of it when we pray. Now this isn&rsquo;t to say prayer is inadequate, we haven&rsquo;t begun to pray, let&rsquo;s put it that way. Now prayer doesn&rsquo;t need words, the real prayer as Mahatma Gandhi once said, is a complete fast, that means of food, of ideas, of speech, of sight, smelling, and hearing, you&rsquo;re fasting away from all these things, you&rsquo;re shutting off from all these things, that would be a complete prayer of putting it in his words. In the words of the Master Jesus, &ldquo;When thou prayest, retreat into thy innermost chamber.&rdquo; Now where would be the innermost chamber of a human being? Certainly it is not in the bathroom of the house, where would the innermost chamber be in this physical frame that you would have to retreat in to pray? And the instructions were specific, &ldquo;knock.&rdquo; Now you can only knock at one particular portion of a building for it to open, he says &ldquo;knock and it shall be opened.&rdquo; Do you knock out the window to have somebody admit you in or you knock at the door? A certainly I don&rsquo;t think a Master would indicate such terminology unless he was fully aware of the inner workings of the mechanism that it was a door. Now in the oriental writings this is called &ldquo;the tenth door of the house of God,&rdquo; the Dasam Dvar or the third eye, it&rsquo;s a door, it opens, and we see three colors in light. When we see the first color it&rsquo;s gold and this golden light is the presence of the Holy Spirit and you begin to speak in tongues, it&rsquo;s the gift of the Holy Spirit when it does descend on the human being. 0:40 Now speaking in tongues is one of the functions but not as what we see today and call it speaking in tongues, there are living Masters who do converse in every known language, as scholar would converse, not just talking some few words out of a language and then somebody tried to interpret it, they are fully realized. Even in the time of Jesus the twelve disciples who went out and spoke in every man&rsquo;s language according to the area he went to, so there&rsquo;s a big difference between having psychological awakenings and a spiritual awakening. The five senses can do many things, this subconscious mind can do many things except one thing, anything it does there is no permanency in it, it is the greatest imitator of all the spiritual laws that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re the psychic and the Saint part company, that&rsquo;s where the people who have all these so-called spiritual experiences think they&rsquo;re having spiritual experiences but they&rsquo;re only having mental experiences. The genuine Saint don&rsquo;t even do anything because in the first place he will transmit to you without the use of language the thought image to your mind and that&rsquo;s where he transcends the psychic. He will let you have the inner experience, he will open a door in your consciousness for you to experience something that&rsquo;s not possible to be transferred, there&rsquo;s a big difference. Now we have evidence of that, when the Master Jesus was in the body he fed many people, now if it was a mental hallucination or a hypnotic trick to feed so many thousand people good and fine but why make an issue over twelve baskets of crumbs after they finish eat? Who makes an issue of the dishes you gotta clean up when you feed the group of people as something so important and significant at a feast because that&rsquo;s labor involved, to clean it up during and record it, then it&rsquo;s a permanency involved, there&rsquo;s a big difference. You can trick the public into thinking they have eaten and you can take a camera photograph and there&rsquo;s nothing being eaten but if you have the evidence of 12 baskets of crumbs then there&rsquo;s something here that transcends, there&rsquo;s a difference altogether, we&rsquo;re speaking of entirely different experience, an entirely different control of knowledge that is passing by way through Man from the higher self, God. Now a real genuine Saint or Master would never say the things he do, you cannot do. If he&rsquo;s giving you the truth it&rsquo;s because he knows that there is no monopoly on the truth, the emphasis is towards meditation but meditation is a very tough road. I don&rsquo;t say you can sit down and meditate and become Masters, I don&rsquo;t promise you that, well I do say this though: through the practice of meditation you will gradually learn how to meditate and in so doing you will experience everything that the Master Jesus spoke of. Now through the practice of playing on the violin one day you may be out on the podium, a virtuoso in front of the audience, realized men are the result of long practice, it&rsquo;s not an overnight thing but what it offers in the early stages of the growth, it offers you peace, sense of direction, knowledge of yourself, and strength that comes that nowhere else can come from. Those who have passed through these fires, as I call them the fires of realization, they&rsquo;re no longer the person they were when they started. I have seen many, this last summer I was fortunate to be with some young boys and girls who spent some time with me in New Orleans and they were not pampered and they had some rough going to get knuckled down to meditation but I do say this, I&rsquo;m very proud of the results that came from them of their tremendous growth from what they were to what they are now and more is yet to come out of it, they&rsquo;ve made tremendous strides in acquiring the inner peace. Now when you begin to meditate three things occur right away: one, you&rsquo;re going to be the center of ridicule and aggravation and in fact you wish you had never meditated or ever heard of the word because everything starts crashing on you then, crumbling down, they think you&rsquo;re a nut or something is wrong with you and since you don&rsquo;t go along with the environmental ideas of how to acquire calmness or maintain your peace of mind, something has got to be wrong with you. Now the second thing you&rsquo;re going to run into, your selection and association with ideas, behavior patterns, starts to be very confusing. You don&rsquo;t know which is the right one and which is wrong one, what was accepted before is no longer seem to be accepted and before you know it, you&rsquo;re swamped with all types of behavior patterns which to choose from. You&rsquo;ll be actually sitting at the cafeteria of behavioral ideas and don&rsquo;t know what to do, you&rsquo;ll get indigestion of the brain, then you need mental physic, that&rsquo;s a mental laxative, to clear out the whole thing out of the consciousness and again you find that some days you&rsquo;ll meditate and you&rsquo;ll be going pretty well like nothing in this world can affect you, boom for a whole week everything goes the other way and for a whole month it goes the other way or a whole year it goes the other way. Nothing seems to go, like if you run into a stone wall, then all of a sudden you find that you&rsquo;re more confused than when you started out, you&rsquo;re grasping for every thread of information on how to to stay on an even keel in meditation and then you start to wonder, &ldquo;Why did I ever get into this thing? Why weren&rsquo;t I content to live in my little ignorance where it was blissful than to investigate into truth where it is so drastic and demanding?&rdquo; Just then your higher intelligence comes to the rescue, as you say in some writings you will call it your guardian angel takes care now or the Guru takes care or God takes care, anyone you want to use. This is only the various cycles of natural resistance built into this mechanism in order to produce strength, in order to produce volition. As I said first you&rsquo;ll get peace, you&rsquo;ll get a knowledge of yourself, then there&rsquo;s a strength that comes, and finally there&rsquo;s an extra sensory force that follows you. 0:50 These are fires, they burn, and at the same time they can do something, they&rsquo;re power at the same time and they say &ldquo;When the Soul has been burnt in the fires of wisdom and been bleached of all dross, it returns back to its pristine state, ever knowing, ever doing, ever experiencing, but until that time it&rsquo;s searching, it&rsquo;s trial and erro. Now don&rsquo;t think for one moment meditation is just horrible and drab, it&rsquo;s not, these are the many aspects of it, there are beautiful aspects in it too, there are aspects of beauty in it that will eventually, if we don&rsquo;t watch ourselves, we will develop into a big egotist because you think of something and it happens and sooner or later your ego starts puffing up, you can do no wrong but that&rsquo;s the worst time. He who knows is guilty first and he is more gullible because he will use these forces of his consciousness unknowingly, uncontrolled, without any sense of direction and hurt his own self with his own ego but the divine intelligence is also great in itself that it stops it, You can only use up so much of this so-called force to develop this so-called inflated ego before the needle of bitter experience comes and punctures it and you come tumbling back down on your feet, you start all over again learning humility. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said to his mother and she sensed it in him, &ldquo;They have no wine,&rdquo; she said. She sensed this in her son and you can imagine in a nice Jewish family wedding, &ldquo;Abe my boy, there is no more wine here, what can you do?&rdquo; And you can see him thinking, &ldquo;Mama my time ain&rsquo;t come now.&rdquo; This could be the kind of expression if one has ever lived among Jewish people and understand the humor that passes in their conversation but she sensed it in her son. Now if he was not aware of what this force could do, he would never remark &ldquo;my time has not yet come&rdquo; because if he did it before his real time, it would be all ego. By not doing it before the divine time, which is conscious will or God&rsquo;s will in Man, he was not liable for the repercussions of his thinking which we call karma or the seeds you sow, you reap, there is no ego. You see ego, an action performed from an egotistical attitude, has certain repercussions, it is like a man writing on a piece of paper with a pen, versus a Man who would try to write on water, that is an egoless man. An egoless person anything he does there is no repercussion, in fact the Masters have always said, &ldquo;Where there is no ego, under the worst conditions where every man would fail, an egoless man would succeed&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s what makes the difference because there is no motivation for personal gain but meditation shows us this. Through the meditation we are confronted with these things, we wouldn&rsquo;t find it in a book, we cannot find it in no scriptures, the scriptures are only references as to what we will experience from meditation, that&rsquo;s why meditation is such a difficult science to follow. Some of us give up, others who continue will reach it, but I say this, don&rsquo;t give up. It&rsquo;s like two frogs at once fell into a bowl of cream, there was a large frog and a small frog. The large frog says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to swim around here, why try to get out of this thing, might as well give up and die.&rdquo; Little frog says, &ldquo;No as long as I am living, I&rsquo;m breathing, I&rsquo;m going to try.&rdquo; So he tried and tried and tried and getting weaker and weaker. So with all his encouragement to the bigger frog, so the bigger frog joined and they tried, getting tireder and tireder, so the big frog says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fed up, there&rsquo;s no hope and he gave up and died.&rdquo; Little frog who kept on breathing said, &ldquo;Well as long as I&rsquo;m breathing I&rsquo;m trying.&rdquo; So he kept on trying and what happened? From moving around so long in that cream, the cream became hard like butter and he found himself sitting on a solid piece of substance and he took a deep breath and jumped out of the bowl. So it&rsquo;s exactly what would happen in meditation, you&rsquo;re gonna find yourself sitting in a bowl of cream after a while then you start swimming around in it, you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going and if we give up, we&rsquo;re back just where we started. If we don&rsquo;t stop and we keep going, eventually we come out. This is one of the requirements for the strength of the Soul, as I said you will acquire a strength that you never had before, you will not know the strength existed in you until you passed through it. These are qualities that cannot be gained unless you experience them from within yourself, no one can give it to you or you cannot read about it and in a meditative class you&rsquo;re forced to struggle with yourself, you&rsquo;re forced to study your mind how it functions, why does the mind move back and forth. Even if you close your eyes for a second, you want to think, it seems that you cannot stop thinking and you ask yourself &ldquo;Why is it I cannot stop thinking just for one brief moment and give my brain a rest? So I&rsquo;ll force myself to sleep&rdquo; but do we stop the brain thinking when we&rsquo;re sound asleep? Ask yourself again, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m sound asleep, do I know if I&rsquo;m a man or a woman?&rdquo; Right again the brain is thinking, &ldquo;Do I really know if I&rsquo;m a man or a woman when I&rsquo;m sound asleep?&rdquo; And it will hang on your consciousness, &ldquo;which is it? Who am I? What am I? What is this? Why do I keep thinking? Why can I not stop thinking?&rdquo; Now the Zen Masters have said &ldquo;Zen begins when thinking stops&rdquo; and we fondle and worry what do they really mean? They try to meditate for hours trying to figure out what does this man mean when he says &ldquo;Zen begins when thinking stops.&rdquo; Zen is only a shortening of the word Zenith, you reach the zenith of consciousness when your thinking stops, for the first time you get an extra sensory awareness, an awareness that is devoid of thinking. Now this is an entirely different experience altogether, that the moment it occurs when that thinking stops and there is no idea that you are familiar with via the five senses passing through the brain, at that very split second the Japanese people or the Chinese people have all called it Satori or the Orientals have called it realization, illumination, the Christian mystics have called it that. At a very instant there is an extra sensory awareness, an awareness that stays with you if you are conscious of what you do and if you are not, then it passes away but it&rsquo;s never lost, you always seem to recollect in some form, you always seem to think back &ldquo;I did have a strange experience, what is it?&rdquo; And then you start searching and you start seeking the information for it but the answer is in ourselves again, we have to go back in and we will see a light and the answer is in the light, the three colors of the light has the answer. 1:00 There is the gold and there&rsquo;s the blue. Now the gold is the cosmic vibration on which the whole structure of creation exists or come into existence, everything in this universe is a result of vibration, we cannot go outside of it, it&rsquo;s there. The Zen Masters had this, if this is the sound of two hands clapping (clapping sound), what is the sound of one hand clapping? Challenges the mind and you start to ponder but it&rsquo;s all vibration. Now the Masters have said this is not where we stop, this is just where we begin to watch inside ourselves, observation, I said meditation is observation and oneness of the numina before, we are trying to observe first in order to become one. Now in a few weeks from now the Jewish people will be celebrating a particular day called Yom Kippur or the day of atonement which actually is the day of &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; but eventually became adulterated into a day of atonement. When the early mystics of the Hebrew faith practiced &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; and since they achieved the realization, the followers didn&rsquo;t achieve anything because the followers were not competent or did not evolve past it, so they then finding like a dog in the manger, you know can&rsquo;t eat the grass, so he says &ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; these masses weren&rsquo;t trying for &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; they&rsquo;re trying for atonement and end up having something to atone for. All the scriptures show in all the writings of all the great Sages we are not atoning for anything, we are all striving to reach the &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; of God in ourselves and by our own actions and thoughts we modify what we have done, we alone can modify it. If you did something, we ourselves have the ability and the courage to make the modification, that&rsquo;s why Jesus could tell the man &ldquo;your sins are forgiven you&rdquo; and the people say he blasphemeth, they did not comprehend the thing. We can modify what we have done by our power of thinking, concentration, and volition, no one has to do that for us but we shirk this responsibility and we throw it off for somebody else, we pass the buck, this is a human principle too, this is part of our nature to do that because we find it was easy to do under certain environmental conditions at certain times but then we sooner have to face it some time or later that we have to modify these things ourselves again. Until we make the jump to modify, we cannot realize the &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; of our nature with God. Now the Sages are trying to tell us that we must make the effort to realize our divine nature, they gave us basic techniques of how to do it, it has been called meditation but the techniques are obvious to us all the time, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; How can you make your eyes single but to close them and watch inside. Now you have a car, it has two lights, do they not form into one single beam when it&rsquo;s focused out? The same principle of the optical nerve here, doctors have proven now that the human brain has enough electrical power to light up a 25 watt bulb, now if the Master Jesus is talking of light, he&rsquo;s talking of the factual laws of nature, he&rsquo;s not talking of something imaginary thing, that there is a force, a divine power existing right in here that we have totally ignored, totally did not understand or comprehend, that&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;the light shines in darkness and darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; The five senses of the human brain cannot comprehend the intricacies of the extrasensory nature and its subtle electrical forces, it takes the extrasensory nature, the intuitive nature, to comprehend it and it takes the actual inner experience of meditation to be exposed to it. Now those who have gone in and see this light and felt it can always vouch for three things any place anytime: they can vouch for peace, they can vouch for consciousness, they can vouch for strength, and the peace means this whole body is shut down as if it&rsquo;s a state of suspended animation. Consciousness it knows, your whole life history is open to the man who see it. That&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;God is always watching you,&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t make a wrong move in front of this consciousness because it&rsquo;s knowing, total knowing. And strength, that is you can face your obligations or your responsibilities without shirking them or trying to hide in some retreat. The only retreat or any hermitage is this (Adano pats his body), the physical ones are only shortcuts to help us to realize this, they are not the real retreat, the real retreat is here. Yet to understand this mechanism, to link this mechanism back to its source, the divinity itself. Now meditation has another subtle function which is not obvious to people except those who are highly sensitive and can observe what goes on in meditation and that is a switching over of the inner currents from the negative portion of the human body, which is the emotional nature, to the positive portion of the human body which is the devotional nature. Now Jesus made one reference to that state, that condition, when he rebuked Peter, he said to Peter, &ldquo;You have been with me so long in the regenerative life and knew me not&rdquo; and many are stumped with that statement not knowing what is involved in that statement but Jesus was making reference to a very scientific principle within the principles of meditation and the process of meditation. &ldquo;You were with me in the regenerative life,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;you were with me in the degenerative life&rdquo; or the generate life, but with the re-generate life, &ldquo;you were with me in the re-generate life and knew me not.&rdquo; Now here is a human body talking to a human body, is it that what is involved in the statement? No, the Master Jesus is fully aware of what is going on within his mechanism, therefore he is seeing within his own inner consciousness not only the golden light of pure vibration that is the cause of creation, he is seeing the pure Christ consciousness now, the intelligence present within that vibratory creation from an independent source of the five senses, from an intuitive nature, he&rsquo;s fully aware of this function and that this function regenerates all life. This function is responsible for life staying on the planet or on all planets, it&rsquo;s responsible for bringing the dead back to life because it&rsquo;s the intelligence within the life, it&rsquo;s the intelligence between the atomic structure and this can only be perceived by an extra sensory nature. He&rsquo;s seeing this within himself but Peter could not see this because Peter was not that evolved, Peter was only a disciple and could not comprehend it, that&rsquo;s why when he asked Peter the question, &ldquo;Who do men say that I am?&rdquo; He was trying to find out if Peter had reached any realization within himself to comprehend what is going on and Peter barely said, &ldquo;Thou art Christ, Son of living God.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you that, my Father which is in heaven revealed it to you.&rdquo; 1:10 In other words &ldquo;you got a glimpse within yourself Peter of the extrasensory nature of your own self and from that plateau of consciousness, you see the same thing I am seeing, you see the thing that I am identified with&rdquo; and Peter still could not comprehend, that&rsquo;s why he made the remark. Peter was not able to have the transference from the energies from the emotional nature, transfered to the energies of the devotional nature, this is something that goes on in meditation, that&rsquo;s why there is a link between a Master and a disciple. We cannot meditate by ourselves and achieve real success, we all need help, that&rsquo;s why even when Master Jesus was on the earth, he had 12 disciples who he helped and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a relationship between a Master and a disciple, this goes on in an unbroken link all the time. Now he said, &ldquo;He that doeth the will of the Father is my brother and my sister and he that followeth in my word is my disciple.&rdquo; That is very specific, none of us can say we are doing the will of the Father, otherwise we&rsquo;d be doing identically the same thing as Jesus. Now how many of us can say we are following in the words so we can be disciples? It&rsquo;s very difficult yet to be a disciple, let&rsquo;s just take one of the requirements, not all the requirements of his life, there are just two fundamental requirements: &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind and heart and neighbor as self.&rdquo; If we can&rsquo;t do that, how are we going to start following being a disciple of such a Master? You see the tremendous challenge that has been thrown upon an individual? The challenge is too much yet at the same time within the challenge there are the keys necessary to face the challenge and to cope with the challenge, the keys are: &ldquo;When thine eyes are single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness,&rdquo; where is it going to shine? Inside this cranium of ours, this skull box, &ldquo;and the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; The darkness is only your five senses because it&rsquo;s limited to the wall, you cannot see beyond the wall, so how can it comprehend outside of the wall? Until you have an extrasensory nature or an extrasensory experience, it transcends it and some people call it clairvoyant, clairvoyant is to see clearly, but until you have this extrasensory experience of this divine quality in yourself and I don&rsquo;t mean what passes for ESP on that level, I&rsquo;m talking of something entirely different removed from that, until this nature of yours is perceiving the creative principle, then we can comprehend what the Master Jesus is talking about. When we meditate there are three colors, there&rsquo;s a gold color and the gold is the Holy Spirit or holy vibration, Saint Paul experienced it when he was struck blind, totally blind, to teach him humility that another physical human being had to restore his sight by touching him on the eyes and remember Paul was a Jewish man by birth of Roman citizenry. He&rsquo;s born under a Roman government that to occupy the country of his native land and he pursued his own countrymen who were calling themselves Christians, they were all Jewish people. Now he pursued them and he turned them in for money until he was struck down blind to be taught humility to go to one of them to be touched on the eyes to be healed to regain a sight. We&rsquo;re talking of something here that is involving difference and he saw this light and out of this light he heard a voice, now where did this voice come from? The Masters say it comes from the blue, the color that we see inside, there&rsquo;s an opalescent blue light in there and all the Masters and I don&rsquo;t say mediums or entities that people go to mediums and try to hear something about the past life, the Masters, the real Saints of God, the real realized people of God, they communicate with us from that realm that is the intuitive realm, that is the Christ realm, it&rsquo;s blue. In that realm and Master Jesus knew it thoroughly and Master Yogananda when he was in the body used to teach people how to see Jesus, not an imaginary Jesus because he gave the technique. He said &ldquo;When you meditate look inside here until you see the blue light and don&rsquo;t stop until you see Jesus.&rdquo; Now he says, &ldquo;If you see Jesus don&rsquo;t stop, unless you think it&rsquo;s an imagination, until Jesus materializes himself in front of you.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t stop meditating until Jesus speaks to you&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stop meditating until Jesus will eat a piece of bread that you have taken and hand him to eat and have evidence that that bread would not rot 10-15 days after, then you know you had an experience with the real Jesus of the scriptures, not an imaginary experience of some dreamed up thing or the fact that he didn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; and this was a Master who lived in this century, passed away in 1952 and these were his explicit instructions to all his disciples, that the Masters are not fakes, they do exist and they are not dead and the approach to them is via meditation, it&rsquo;s a genuine science. Now, but they say to us the road is not easy but it has its compensations, do not look for the miracles because &ldquo;what would benefit you to gain the whole world and lose your Soul,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s one way of putting it but first concentrate on attaining the inner peace, attaining the consciousness, attaining the inner strength, and the fourth will be added to you. That&rsquo;s why he says, &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and all these things will be added.&rdquo; This added is a real truth, if you set out seeking extrasensory perception, developing one two three different parts of it, sooner or later they will fade away, pass away from you, but if you concentrate on acquiring the inner peace, the inner consciousness, and the inner strength, these forces flow by divine grace, this is an unusual principle. Why? It&rsquo;s to separate the psychics from the Saints, the psychics will always be around us but the Saints are very few because their road is so hard not to be trapped by the ego, to exhibit the psychic power, to exhibit the spiritual forces. It&rsquo;s easy to know that we have this thing and we want to do it. You have a loved one who is dying and you want to help them and you may be in the possession of the force and you say, &ldquo;Is it wrong that I should not?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll go through all type of mental turmoil to do these things yet the divine law is still there that tells us we can&rsquo;t interfere with that person&rsquo;s spiritual principle. We can send them thoughts and love and hope that the Divine Will flow through, that&rsquo;s why in time certain people Jesus never healed them, he said &ldquo;with these people I can&rsquo;t do nothing&rdquo; and some he healed but he didn&rsquo;t come primarily to heal. If that was his mission then that would be the mission of all the spiritual Masters, the mission of all the Masters is to make us understand the principle of life. &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly&rdquo; that you may understand how life functions within you as God, more abundantly, not in the sense of material objects, in the sense that consciousness can focus it. That&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;No man taketh my life from me, I lay it down, I can pick it up back. I have this consciousness, I know from what I speak of that this conscious life can go down in a physical frame and walk away and come back.&rdquo; Some people call it astral projection but it&rsquo;s more than that because how will you raise up Lazarus from the dead? There are other principles involved, there&rsquo;s principles of love that are highly involved in it that we don&rsquo;t know about. See love above all things was his first commandment and above all things was his last commandment, he says &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; because within the secret of love all the things that are added come flowing quicker but once the concept of love is dried up in us, we struggle to find these things, it don&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s why he made a great issue of love and all the Masters who teach truth will tell you that love can move it, love can do it, love is devotion, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s different. 1:20 To those who meditate and they say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get results Adano, how can you say I&rsquo;m getting results when I don&rsquo;t see results. I&rsquo;m getting more turmoil.&rdquo; And I say &ldquo;you are getting results, it&rsquo;s the turmoil that represents results, the more turmoil you get is the more results you&rsquo;re getting because you&rsquo;re getting the strength that I&rsquo;m looking for, it&rsquo;s coming out of you.&rdquo; The ability to fight back your emotional nature, the stronger you get above your emotional nature, the greater your devotion will become, the greater the realization will become but without it you have nothing. If a car don&rsquo;t have a certain traction or resistance to move against&hellip; it&rsquo;s like a chicken and a shell, if you try to tear off the shell to help the chicken, the chicken will die, let that chicken fight its way out. Sometimes you see it fighting and you so much compassion feeling for that chicken, &ldquo;why does he have to struggle so much?&rdquo; But he&rsquo;s gaining strength, how is he gonna gain strength if you only spoon feed him or lead him by the hand all the time. Meditation, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s individualistic, it is something that demands the strength to come out of us, it&rsquo;s a process that brings out the strength in us, it&rsquo;s the process that brings out the peace that is latent in us, it&rsquo;s a process that opens up a consciousness that is dormant in us in order that we can become a channel for the forces that hold us together, it&rsquo;s a big difference when we start meditating to understand what we are doing. Meditation is not involved in healing, neither is it involved in trying to perform miracles, neither is it involved in trying to make us holier than thou or better than the other individual, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s totally involved with a face-to-face reality with yourself and God and the emphasis being on your self effort. Now when Jesus spoke, he spoke in a dualistic language, very psychological, very spiritual, very literal at the same time, &ldquo;You see me you see the Father&rdquo; and this is a very psychological statement and a very spiritual statement and a very literal statement. God is a manifested form, body, matter, &ldquo;Come let us make Man in our own image and likeness.&rdquo; Man is the organized mechanism or thinking mechanism, male and female, image is the electronic principle, likeness is the total awareness, the conscious life in it, and if you see it you&rsquo;ve got to see the realized consciousness which is God, but you&rsquo;re not seeing a body, you&rsquo;re not seeing an image as to say my hand is God, you&rsquo;re seeing the forces of nature or the divine principles congealed as a result of these laws. Until as a scientist we start breaking it down and we start to see the complex mathematical intricacies involved in putting it together, then we realize we haven&rsquo;t yet tapped this divinity because we couldn&rsquo;t even make a fingernail let alone try to put it together, we&rsquo;re tapping certain of its functions. So when He said, &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father, it&rsquo;s psychological in one way, it&rsquo;s literal in one way, but spiritual another way because this was the whole creative principle, that we face the life within us and experience this from an extrasensory nature, that we do see this force for the first time responsible for us. The only way to describe that until you can see the white light inside your head and it looks like a dove that&rsquo;s why he said a dove descended in his shoulder, it&rsquo;s like a five-pointed star upside down, always beaming on you like a spotlight, there&rsquo;s no way you can turn, it&rsquo;s always there. You can open your eyes and you&rsquo;ll see it all the time, you can&rsquo;t shut your eyes there&rsquo;s no place you can go to hide from it, they&rsquo;re always looking at you. In other words you&rsquo;re always in front of the consciousness of God, there&rsquo;s no way you can hide from God, in other words there is no way you can hide from your inner self once it&rsquo;s open to you. That is why Masters have always said when the student is ready they will come, that means when we are ready to live a life of self-observation, a meditative life, they will intercede and take us in hand, not until we are ready for that, they don&rsquo;t take a hand, they allow us our own free will to burn up ourselves through our own ego, through our own emotional nature, but when we&rsquo;ve reach what we call the point where we want to change, we want to re-evaluate ourselves and really set our consciousness on realization of ourselves, then they will intercede, then they say you&rsquo;re ready. Now you can&rsquo;t find them, they&rsquo;ll find you, this is a peculiar part of the truth, none of the disciples found Jesus, Jesus found them, if you read back in your scriptures did they find Jesus, did they go out and look for him? He came and found them, he called them to him, this is one of the laws of it. A disciple is not seeking his Master, a Master is picking up his disciples, those who are ready in consciousness, he&rsquo;s drawing them to him. Now when you are ready you are drawn regardless and you don&rsquo;t have to hear this conversation, the moment you close your eyes to meditate you will feel it, the pull from inside that you know you&rsquo;re ready to go inside, my conversation will just flitter away to your ears, moment you shut your eyes from now on inside you&rsquo;re going, the inner consciousness, the God within you, the real Master is pulling you in now, he is taking you out of this sensory realm, he is lifting you up, that&rsquo;s why they say the Guru means, &ldquo;he who lifts up,&rdquo; not the literal man, literal man don&rsquo;t lift up, it is the consciousness that lifts us up from within ourselves but we have the respect and we have the obligation and the example of what Soul is in a literal Man. Unless we had one to inspire us, we wouldn&rsquo;t know, we would have no way to evaluate ourselves. So we are given meditation as a way, as a process, to make this evaluation, to make this self-discovery. To sum it up we have to do it ourselves and don&rsquo;t worry about reaching the end of realization, realization is a moment-to-moment experience, most people have already pictured in their mind that realization is some way out in the limb you know, it&rsquo;s not. If you get into the French word &ldquo;relisier,&rdquo; that is to make concrete and to make concrete is to experience, it&rsquo;s a moment-to-moment experience from within yourself. So once you begin to look inside there&rsquo;s a golden light, there&rsquo;s the blue, and there&rsquo;s the white. The white light is pure consciousness but I said before the whole thing is sound also, there are some sounds that you will hear from the audible lifestream flowing in you. In the Book of Revelation, and it&rsquo;s well named too, Revelation, that means it was revealed from within to the man who wrote the book, no one gave it to him, no physical person gave it to him, he had to meditate and he did not get it in his early part of his life, he got it in the latter part of his life when he was in exile and in prison. The author of the Book of Revelation is called John and he died in an island called Patmos and it was in the prison he had the revelation of the electronic structure of his mechanism. From the meditation he saw now the electrical anatomy of his mechanism for the first time he saw it and in that electrical anatomy he saw and wrote in the language he thought best he could write and describe it. 1:30 He said around the throne of God there were seven golden candlesticks with seven angels, this was the only way he could have described it because he lived in an agricultural society at the time, a throne would be a seat, candlestick would represent light, an angel would represent an intelligence. In modern terminology to the realized man at the center of pure consciousness there are seven vortices of energy revolving in the electronic anatomy of the human body and within these vortices there are seven levels of awareness representing your seven angels. Now when you look inside, as I said this is revealed and you look inside from long practice of meditation, you begin not only to see but you hear, that&rsquo;s why in the scriptures you will often read where the prophets said, &ldquo;Lo they turned to the east and they heard the voice of God like many waters and like the sound of the trumpet blowing.&rdquo; People thought you looked to the geographical east and there was some guy behind him with a long thing blowing, you know standing by the river side, it didn&rsquo;t mean that. This is east in man, this is west in man, this is north in Man, and this is south in man, he&rsquo;s a miniature universe already. Trumpet blowing is one of the centers, one of these vortices, giving off a particular sound and that particular intelligence with that sound has a certain extrasensory power of its own, which they call the Siddhic force or psychic power that reaches out and effects matter and all we can say is that he has acquired some force from God that he can control his environment. He heard this within himself and therefore acquired it, this is an acquired knowledge now by revelation, God, the Soul reality that we are. The first phase of this whole process is towards observation because we would not know what to do when we became one if we did not observe, we are creatures who must rationalize, we don&rsquo;t know why we have to rationalize, you ever ask yourself why you have to rationalize things? But you do it, some form of self satisfaction for your ego that you want to do it but you do it nevertheless, so the Creator has made it possible for you to rationalize as much through observation even in the extrasensory part of your your make-up, He has made this rationalization possible, remarkable man huh? A marvelous concept and it is a principle of truth, until you&rsquo;re totally saturated with observation of your inner nature of your whole being, none of us will accept the oneness of his divinity. It&rsquo;s very hard for any man to want to accept the oneness of his divinity. Yet when you do accept the oneness of your divinity, this is an odd thing because even Jesus had to accept it and all great Masters do accept it eventually, &ldquo;I and my Father are one&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re not talking it from lip service now. &ldquo;I and my Father one&rdquo; is definitely a realization that comes now from a transformation of the emotional nature to a devotional nature, it&rsquo;s a change in that person. Sometimes you see it among Catholic mystics or Christian saints where there&rsquo;s a certain transformation from one phase of life and they never seem to go back as if some people who can stop smoking and drinking like that (snaps his fingers), others may take time. Some people who stop instantly may fall back, it does happen, and so it has happened too with those who have had a certain change of consciousness. There are cases where that had happened, it&rsquo;s a big difference when we understand what&rsquo;s going on, that an inner change can come in a dramatic way or it can come in a gradual way. One last aspect of meditation, and you can ask questions because I hope not keeping you folks bored with my words. The final aspect of meditation is called moksha or liberation, freed while living, it&rsquo;s easy to be freed when you&rsquo;re dead, there&rsquo;s nothing to be worrying about, there&rsquo;s no more responsibility in a physical sense to be involved with but then you&rsquo;re freed into eternity in which the greater involvement and the greater responsibility becomes but you don&rsquo;t know what that responsibility is and what that involvement is, this is something we can only assume from our five senses that we look out through the sky. We can&rsquo;t see it by an extrasensory nature what is occurring in its electrical principle, let alone it&rsquo;s in its ideational principle, we don&rsquo;t know, but to be freed while living in a mechanism gives us a possibility of what the responsibility and the involvement can be when we do decide to shed the frame.</p>
<h2 id="1968-november-2---part-2-spirit">1968 November 2 - Part 2 Spirit</h2>
<p>Adano68_11_02_2Vol1SpiritQ1RRNW6 - That&rsquo;s why the question will always come up, &ldquo;Why do Masters die? If they are Masters of life and death, why do they have to die?&rdquo; This you can see is a question that will come up in their rational mind. It&rsquo;s not that they have to die, Masters are only realized Souls who use the physical frame for exemplary service to other individuals who believe they have a Soul until they have enough strength to shut off the concept and stand up on their own two feet, then they go on and leave them knowing that they are now capable of living as Soul. The Master is not going to pamper you, in fact the Master, he&rsquo;s tougher than your father, he&rsquo;s tougher than your mother, he&rsquo;s tougher than the worst jailer in jail, he&rsquo;s tougher than the biggest slave master possible you can dream up, he&rsquo;s tougher than that, but he is far more loving than your father can be or a mother can be, or a wife can be, and at the same time a Master is the only true godfather you ever had. You know when Christian people say you get baptized you have a godfather or a godmother, only the Master is a godfather because he is the God Man, he is the Man that &ldquo;god-fathers&rdquo; you or fathers you God-ward in yourself, he&rsquo;s the only man can do that because he is in that state of consciousness but he helps us to get to that state then we see ourselves. Now in meditation this final phase is what he brings us to the point we are freed while we are living, a Master does not leave us halfway. Now if he has 50 disciples he&rsquo;s going to pass on to one or two of them the total awareness and the other 48 may not be competent or capable of handling the total awareness, nevertheless that one or two who has the awareness transferred will live long enough to raise another four or six more out of the 50 and the rest will be struggling too and when they gone on, that first two, that four or six that remain they will also be strong enough to lift up another half a dozen and they&rsquo;ll go on and eventually that whole 50 will be all lifted out by the principle of which it has been set up. Now this is true, you have an example, a very good example of it especially in the life of the Master Jesus. The Master Jesus had 12 disciples, when he was in the body none of the 12 got cosmic consciousness except one man and he was not even a disciple and when I say a disciple he did not follow him around as a disciple as the 12 men did yet he was the only man that the Master Jesus bestowed cosmic consciousness on. The Master Jesus told his twelve men at the last supper they&rsquo;ll all leave him and they all jump up with pride, &ldquo;me Master?&rdquo; You can imagine somebody tells you that and you&rsquo;ve been with them so long and you start examining yourself, &ldquo;where did I go wrong&rdquo; but the Master consciousness is perceiving what you are, he&rsquo;s perceiving the structure of your nature, what you will do, what is your lessons to learn, you&rsquo;re not complete so you got to learn these lessons, you don&rsquo;t know what it is to make a mistake in failing someone until you fail them and it could be very insignificant when you fail them but it could be a tremendous catastrophe in your mind. Well these 12 men had to pass these tests, yet there was one man who was not among the 12 and that was the thief on the cross and the recognition comes from the words and the communication between a Master and disciple, this is how we recognize them and how we know there is a transference of this knowledge being given to them or uplifting or lifting up. These two men were being crucified along with the Master Jesus and one said to him, the Master Jesus, &ldquo;What are you so great, why don&rsquo;t you come off, you heal the sick, you raise the dead, why don&rsquo;t you heal yourself now, why do you have to die?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a rational mind, we will all do the same thing, I&rsquo;m not beyond it, I&rsquo;ll be guilty of that too, that&rsquo;s a part of life I may have to pass through too, to make those same mistakes until we learn better and there was the other who says, &ldquo;You have no right to condemn this Man, we have a right to be hanging up here, not him, he didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; That very man turned now to the man Jesus and said, these were his specific words, he didn&rsquo;t say teacher, he didn&rsquo;t say sir, he didn&rsquo;t say Mr. Jesus, he said &ldquo;Master&rdquo; the very first word he used was Master, &ldquo;remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&rdquo; Now this last statement can be very misleading to most people who are unaware of what a disciple relationship with the Master is, for most of us will say &ldquo;Master remember me when you come into your kingdom&rdquo; as if you&rsquo;re challenging him or demanding something from him or he has a right to give you something or he has a right to remember you or &ldquo;Master remember me&hellip; when thou comest into thy kingdom?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a big difference, only a disciple knows that statement thoroughly and only from personal experience can a disciple vouch for the last statement as being the correct one and not the first one as what went on between the thief and the man on the cross. If these two men were about the same age let alone forget there was a spiritual connotation between the two men or connection, they might have seen each other as boyhood friends and one decided to be a minister and the other one decided to be a rebel or a revolutionist and they ended up now hanging on a cross together and one&rsquo;s gonna say &ldquo;You know you didn&rsquo;t have to hang up here like this, you know you could have come my way. Yeah we could all chase the Romans out of this country, you would have to go that way too.&rdquo; Well it&rsquo;s a big difference, a disciple once he sees the Master consciousness and he recognizes it, he&rsquo;s recognizing something from within himself like Peter was recognizing something from within himself when he said, &ldquo;Thou art Christ, son of living God.&rdquo; This is a personal experience occurring in that man&rsquo;s consciousness that he knew that this was his Master, not just for this present body form but that this body form was total consciousness was passing to him in many many body forms and in many many levels of awareness. That&rsquo;s why he said to him, &ldquo;remember me,&rdquo; in other words lift me out from the levels of consciousness that I have dropped down and I&rsquo;ve identified with the various thought patterns and cannot seem to get out and cannot solve the problem of behavior within my own makeup &ldquo;when thou comest into thy kingdom.&rdquo; Now what kingdom is this man going to go to, he&rsquo;s dying on a cross, is he going to Mars? He&rsquo;s on the Earth. Is the Earth the only place where intelligent beings exist? The question comes up is there another kingdom or is there another level of existence that we are totally unaware of that this thief was fully aware of? If the thief is fully aware of a level of existence and the Master Jesus when in the body told his own disciples there was a level of existence, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place. In my Father&rsquo;s house there are many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you, if it were not so I&rsquo;d tell you&rdquo; and he made an issue saying &ldquo;if it were not so I&rsquo;d tell you.&rdquo; Now certainly if he is a Master he cannot lie and if he&rsquo;s lying then we&rsquo;re all victims of a big lie, you follow me? Now realization can vouch for it, meditation can vouch for these Masters truth because they say in their own words &ldquo;heaven and earth will pass away but not one word of mine shall pass away.&rdquo; Anything they have said or done can be validated by the meditative science and we are the recipients of that science, Man today, we&rsquo;re left with this knowledge but we are not using it to validate it, now we are forced to validate it. Are we going to validate our heritage, are we going to accept God now or are we just going to accept being the victim of our circumstances or our environment. No we can&rsquo;t, we have the life within us, we have the intelligence within us, and we have the methods left to us to validate therefore we will validate it regardless or in spite of ourselves the creative intelligence will force us to validate it. This is one peculiar thing of God, in spite of ourselves we are forced to eventually by the laws of evolution we will be forced to validate all these truths about divinity. 0:10 We will have to go from agriculture society to industrial society to space society and beyond the stars to validate what is being said because it is the law of life. Now meditation will follow us all the way, it&rsquo;s a peculiar thing, the Master Jesus was aware of the thief on the cross therefore his answer, his reply proved what the thief knew and experienced. He said to the thief, &ldquo;On this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.&rdquo; Now is paradise somewhere in the galaxies, is paradise a state of awareness? On this date, on this twenty fourth day of June or whatever it was or this good Friday, or was he saying something totally different, &ldquo;there friend, at this very instant, here man, experience total awareness. You and I are in it now, you and I are the same one reality, both of us are one in God, there&rsquo;s no difference, there&rsquo;s no death, it&rsquo;s all life. So don&rsquo;t for one moment falter now because we are all dying from the sensation of pain with the five sense still pulling back.&rdquo; We associated with it through pain you know and yet pain is important. If we have no pain and were we injured and become numb, before we get medical attention we&rsquo;ll be all dead people but it&rsquo;s because of pain and through pain we can incite sensation in these cells until medical attention arrives to keep you alive, so don&rsquo;t knock pain. I happen to say it because I was a living example of the experience, I know what the difference lies, that pain is important as well as it&rsquo;s not important, pain is necessary under certain circumstances and it&rsquo;s not necessary under certain circumstances. So you can hold your consciousness within this frame without having to leave it via pain or you can lose this consciousness and go out and never return into this physical frame by hiding or rejecting pain and it&rsquo;s easy to do that by dulling the senses, the more you dull the senses, the more this consciousness takes over and you become unaware. Now the Masters have always said if liberation is the final goal while living and meditation offers this as a personal experience, tangible experience, then everyone should learn the art of how to die. Now this may sound tragic, sounds so for a young person but that&rsquo;s not what is intended, the art of how to die to your five senses in order to be awake within your extrasensory nature within a physical body. Therefore Saint Paul said in his own statement reversing it, he says &ldquo;I rebuke you in your rejoicing&rdquo; that is &ldquo;I rebuke you people for over indulging through the five senses because I live and die daily in this consciousness. I am capable of shutting on, turning on, this vital power within my mechanism daily, instantly instantly instantly, knowing that when this mechanism has served its purpose of lifting up others who are in need of being lifted up, I eventually will leave it and the &lsquo;I&rsquo; in me would never die because the &lsquo;I&rsquo; in me is eternal like the man and the thief on the cross.&rdquo; You know the thief on the cross he was experienced to say so he said, &ldquo;On this day you will with with me.&rdquo; In other words at this very instant you are going to experience this transition from between being locked up in your five senses in death or to be awake in your consciousness in death. Now we have an example of a man being raised from the dead who was locked up in his consciousness in death and that was Lazarus. Lazarus was a wealthy man you know, he wasn&rsquo;t a poor man and he was one of Jesus&rsquo; sponsors because Jesus stayed there but he wanted to prove to Lazarus that he could not carry his wealth to the grave so he let Lazarus die. When they says &ldquo;but Master you helped so many people, why couldn&rsquo;t you come and help your brother Lazarus&rdquo; and you know the brothers and sisters are all crying. Here he stayed at this man&rsquo;s house and he&rsquo;s his best friend and here of all people he should have been more interested&hellip; that wasn&rsquo;t the reason why he let the man die, a Master and a disciple had a relationship, he saw that this man was locked up in his senses to what he thought was important, that&rsquo;s why he could not leave and follow him as a disciple and when he said &ldquo;leave and follow me as a disciple&rdquo; it don&rsquo;t mean to throw away everything, let your consciousness separate from your possession to your inner self, there are lots of great Masters who have many disciples in this world who are multi-millionaires who have absolutely no desire for their millions, living right here in America and this man had one such disciple. The man had already achieved the ability to shut off his association from his millions and seek the devotional life within himself and did achieve this in this material and did not live in a monastery and this man achieved mukti, he achieved the liberation freed by living in the physical body so we know that by meditation it is possible that this condition can be brought on. Now in Lazarus&rsquo; case Jesus just allowed him to pass on to let him experience that he could not take the consciousness, he could not carry the possession into the grave, then he brought him out and he was a different man after because he was freed now for the first time from the attachment to physical objects. Now many of us when we go out of this frame either by natural law or by accident or some form, may not go out free from attachment because you do not know what you&rsquo;re attached to. Can you say what things you are attached to and what you are not attached? If you analyze your whole consciousness what single idea are you free from? You don&rsquo;t know, if we all knew then we&rsquo;d junk it right away but we can&rsquo;t see and I&rsquo;ll show you a little illustration in my own self. I had an accident once, I fell from 30 feet and I had 54 compound fractures and when I hit the ground I saw my whole life go out of my body and I was in every planet to the universe, it was a marvelous experience, I didn&rsquo;t want to come back. Who wants to come back knowing you have this total freedom, knowing you have the total awareness, who wants to come back? You look at the body on the ground, &ldquo;Heck, you can have it!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing here really holding me because there&rsquo;s no walls, no doors, nothing holding you back, it&rsquo;s total freedom and then the inner consciousness is saying, &ldquo;You have to go back because you have certain unfulfilled functions. That means you cannot just throw yourself out, if those conditions are finished then you don&rsquo;t come back, if it&rsquo;s unfinished you have to come back so I find myself slipping back into the body. Now I&rsquo;m coming back into the body and what I&rsquo;m leading to is how I&rsquo;m going to discover what I&rsquo;m attached to now. I did not know what I&rsquo;m attached to, I find my body all of a sudden started to be numb right up to the lips and I knew if it went to my eyes I might as well give up because then there&rsquo;s no more help and I&rsquo;m not in no medical hand yet to get help. So I realized there the consciousness start to permeate now and you&rsquo;ll be surprised how fast your consciousness can work, it&rsquo;s faster than the speed of light squared. My consciousness is working that fast, it&rsquo;s computing mathematically everything, what&rsquo;s going on and it&rsquo;s telling me &ldquo;create pain or you die.&rdquo; No it&rsquo;s not my physical consciousness, it&rsquo;s the higher consciousness which holds the body together is telling me that. So how do I create pain? I put the finger in my mouth and I started to bite but I couldn&rsquo;t feel nothing, the teeth have no sensation you know when you&rsquo;re numb. You ever get injection from a dentist, can you bite? You can&rsquo;t bite so imagine the whole body is already like if it&rsquo;s in a state of cocaine right up to the hair and I&rsquo;m trying to create pain in a numb area. I&rsquo;m biting, I must be biting for nearly five minutes till I get the first sensation and it&rsquo;s been bitten real hard to create the sensation of pain. The first sensation of pain causes the eyes to dilate. Now if you&rsquo;re dying or you&rsquo;re in an accident or anything and your consciousness is leaving you, the first sensation of the eyes are the eyeballs that start to go like this, start to go down, and eventually when you do die they pull themselves up and they stick up in the brain because the energy goes out via the medulla and you&rsquo;re pulled out by the optical energy because God is in the light already, you are locked up into it, your whole vital current is locked up in there with your breath and when you leave your body through conscious experience, you pass out the same way except those who pass out by psychic phenomena through the solar plexus. Now Saint Paul had this experience and he knew how to go out, now this experience is coming on me and I had to bite and when I did start to feel the pain then my eyes started to pull back, I&rsquo;m seeing the relationship and I started to see clearly now. 0:20 I start to keep on biting then the sensation of pain start to descend as I keep biting the sensation start to descend and it stops just above here, from here on I&rsquo;m clear, I can feel myself, I can touch and pinch my ears and I know I&rsquo;m alive, from here on I don&rsquo;t feel anything so I&rsquo;m not worried as long as I&rsquo;m seeing and I&rsquo;m not going to fall asleep, I&rsquo;m staying awake and awake means to be alive. Now concentration means to focus one&rsquo;s attention and that means to be alive so when he says &ldquo;do you concentrate&rdquo; ask yourself &ldquo;Am I alive?&rdquo; If you are alive you&rsquo;re concentrating, if you&rsquo;re dead you can&rsquo;t concentrate, so you&rsquo;re not focusing, you&rsquo;re not centralizing your energies, so I&rsquo;m pulling in and right away I seen this light coming down, there was a light starting to descend, from this light I can feel life now come. Well until I got into the hospital and the doctor stuck the hypodermic into my arm and I knew I was under medical attention right then my brain for the first time fluctuated and went to something that I considered at the time important to me, having totally disregard for what happened to this physical frame. The thing that I was thinking of, I have three employees that I have to provide work for tomorrow, I own a store, and I got to open up at seven o&rsquo;clock. This was hanging on my mind and here I didn&rsquo;t even know the extent of the damage of my body and this is so predominant in my mind. Now I begin to realize what is my attachment, the attachment wasn&rsquo;t this body, the attachment wasn&rsquo;t the sense of death, the attachment is these three people and they&rsquo;re only employees to me in a sense and a business that I have and the bills I have to pay. So okay, so I said to myself when he gave me the injection I&rsquo;m going to wake up seven o&rsquo;clock next morning because that&rsquo;s when I have to open the store. So I&rsquo;m picturing a clock in my brain, a long arm at 12 and a short am at 7, and again the pain starts to disappear for now, it&rsquo;s coming right up, and I went totally blank. Now in the last state of my mind, and this is what the Masters are saying again, is that your whole thing that pulls your life back into your body, it has to do with the principle of life and breath, and I&rsquo;m out. All of a sudden I am thinking, it goes to show you how this phenomenon of the brain works, I am thinking that it is seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning and this happened on Wednesday night, ring ring ring, like an alarm clock &ldquo;wake up Adano, wake up, it&rsquo;s seven o&rsquo;clock, wake up&rdquo; and I can see this big clock right there banging and I see the long arm and I&rsquo;m struggling to get out of this stupor, you know you want to wake up in the morning, it&rsquo;s tough to get up when you don&rsquo;t want to get up, well I&rsquo;m struggling to get up and I did like this and I heard some voices said, &ldquo;Well if he doesn&rsquo;t die now he&rsquo;ll never die&rdquo; and right then I said &ldquo;Who is dying!&rdquo; The shock and when they pulled down all the plasma and I see my friend standing in the room, my mind is fluctuating again, &ldquo;How can he be in my room? I locked the door, this is Thursday morning.&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Hey how did you got inside?&rdquo; My conversation is betraying the fluctuation of mind and my attachment and he says &ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re in the hospital what day.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;hospital, what day is this? Is this thursday morning?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;No this is Saturday at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; Loss of time, the attachment that brings my life back into my body to wake me up in a conscious state. Now you see what reincarnation can put you in, why you wake up bawling when your doctor take off from the mother and the umbilical cord? You&rsquo;re in the wrong environment with the wrong set of ideas, confined to a physical body of only eight or nine pounds, and you gotta bawl. There&rsquo;s nothing else for you to do, you&rsquo;re restricted, there&rsquo;s nothing else you can do. So you find your straight jacketed and I found I had to accept lying in the hospital like that, why? I couldn&rsquo;t go anyplace, do anything, so sooner or later the mind started to absorb now the new impression. Realizing this, I realize now why they say you have to learn to rid your consciousness by meditation, you have to wash it out daily of the attachments, the things, it may seem kind of cold to say you have a business and you owe these people these things but you don&rsquo;t have no responsibility to them. In emotional nature you feel you have, in a real devotional nature you don&rsquo;t have because in the devotion nature what would have happened had I really broken the attachment to them, I would not have to go back into the body when I fell out the first time but then my consciousness to those people who I was helping or trying to help in meditation, I would be present with them more. Now this is how a Master is able to work with his disciples, you see the disciples of Jesus were not helped the most spiritually while he was in the body, it&rsquo;s after he left the body and having no physical attachment for the physical world pertaining to himself, he had now a devotional quality developed to help his 12 disciples after, that&rsquo;s why he came back to them. Now he had this devotional nature open so there was no attachment, it was totally freedom so he picked up the body again with this total freedom now because he can lay it down and pick it up, having no repercussion from thinking, having no craving, having no responsibility in an emotional nature now, he don&rsquo;t have no business or anything, he was strictly a teacher in truth. So he lift the body back, came to his disciples and reaffirmed their faith in him and themselves, at the same time lift them to a higher plateau of awareness and emphasize that they meditate, that the meditative science was the thing they had to do and this is the final thing about the liberation, that&rsquo;s why you see resurrection is greater than reincarnation. Now until we realize the purpose of resurrection, we&rsquo;re going to keep reincarnating, and the Masters have always said the only reason why the Soul reincarnates because of an unfulfilled desire. Now when all desires are fulfilled or all attachments are eliminated then we achieve resurrection and this is a natural law you see. Now the trees reincarnate but a butterfly resurrects, you have it right in front of you all the time you see, every summer, every spring, every winter, every autumn is the same tree, the same apple growing, coming up all the time, it&rsquo;s reincarnating, hasn&rsquo;t changed but you don&rsquo;t see that when a butterfly comes out from a maggot or a caterpillar. He&rsquo;s a transformation from caterpillar to butterfly after he spins his own web, he is the only creature showing you the principle of resurrection by spinning his own cocoon, which you call the shroud, every principle of creation around you is truth of yourself because we are the epitome, we are the whole crux of it all but it&rsquo;s hard for us to comprehend as tissue because we don&rsquo;t see much of it, we see it happening around us and it&rsquo;s alien and foreign to us and it&rsquo;s separate from us and we have dismal recollection of a few people who have supposedly to have done it and it&rsquo;s hammered into our brain to a point where we get a sort of a constipation of hearing it too often not recognizing what is really happening till we are confronted with having to experiment now for ourselves and I don&rsquo;t blame the young people who take all kind of chemicals to experiment because what has it got to do to find out what&rsquo;s going on inside but the masses will tell you this. There is no shortcut to the extrasensory realm if it was so they had all the opportunity thousands of years to fight it because you could not fool the early Jewish people because they were well versed in psychic phenomena, they knew what hypnotism and all the psychic phenomena. That&rsquo;s why they said Thomas wasn&rsquo;t doubting Jesus because he was a doubting man, he was a scientific man, he wanted to know is this the same thing we&rsquo;re going to have again, is this another apparitional technique somebody&rsquo;s going to pull off on us. No, with all the things that the Master Jesus did there are certain evidence that separates the psychic from the Saint, the evidence is always after the phenomena which you call a phenomena, it&rsquo;s not a phenomena, the act is complete, there are certain tangible evidence that involves physical labor, physical work. In Jesus case the final thing to Thomas, he made him work for it, he said, &ldquo;Come feel friend, touch, make sure.&rdquo; He had to work and go up and touch the man, you know that&rsquo;s why the Master Yogananda says &ldquo;You want to see Jesus, you meditate and keep meditating until he eats a piece of bread or something, you got tangible proof that the Master Jesus is not a figment of your imagination.&rdquo; 0:30 None of these great Masters are a fragment of imagination, men who have fully realized God, as they say &ldquo;Lives of great men all remind us&rdquo; but the lives of the great men don&rsquo;t mean people who knock you on the head and become great you know, it&rsquo;s those who have made the life within the mechanism great by concentrating how to evaluate it and to lift it up that&rsquo;s the difference, these are the men we&rsquo;re talking about so these Masters are Masters of life itself. Audience: Could we have a few question? Adano: Yes sure. Audience: It seems to me that you have said here that meditation is the means to the end of the realization that I am I, when you look inside and see whatever color lights you do see and realize that you are one with God. This realization it seems to me would destroy you as a human being because it would destroy the simple essence of the human being, of free will, free choice, because you couldn&rsquo;t have free choice. Once you realized that you were one with God, your free choice would be gone and it would seem that this would be the end, not the beginning as it should be. Adano: No Abraham, that ain&rsquo;t what it is. In the first place you are never gonna be free from anything, what you are being freed is to be freed FOR, you&rsquo;re never free from responsibility or from choice, you&rsquo;re going to be free for the first time to choose and for responsibilities to be put upon you so that you can choose correctly. This is the first time you can really choose, you&rsquo;re not choosing yet, you&rsquo;re choosing with error, you&rsquo;re not choosing unerringly so that&rsquo;s not choice no more, that&rsquo;s circumstantial pressure. When you are free as a real person, free from within, you are not freed FROM responsibility, you&rsquo;re freed FOR responsibility. Audience: Let me put it another way, anyone who&rsquo;s ever looked through a microscope and seen a simple one-celled animal knows that this cell has irritability which you spoke of, it has reproductivity, it can assimilate, and it can eliminate, and it can move, these are the five essences of life. This combination of elements, inorganic materials and organic materials in this set is mathematically impossible by chance so we know it had to be put together by a divine intelligence. This is one knowledge that it&rsquo;s not difficult to relate, as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s difficult not to believe because there&rsquo;s so much evidence around and that man and the higher primates certainly in this extremely complex, super complex of specialized cells that they have could never never in all of the time become a mathematical possibility of chance. Therefore again, this is a substantiation of this, but the higher realization on a different point again that when you look so far inward that you realize that you are not just a child of God but that you are yourself God or oneness with God is an untenable position to remain living in this phase that we&rsquo;re in, it would seem to be impossible. If you really truly realized, how can you have contact and intercourse with the rest of the human race knowing this or do you know this? Do you really truly yourself know that you are one with God, have you heard &ldquo;I am I?&rdquo; You see the distinction I mean now? Adano: The distinction you&rsquo;re making is only in relation to mind, m-i-n-d, there is no separation at no time, never was. The electrical current in this building lights all the bulbs in various sockets in various parts of the room. Audience: Granted everything that we perceive and everything is&hellip; Adano: So you&rsquo;re experiencing exactly what I&rsquo;m experiencing at the same time but you are unaware of it that&rsquo;s all. Being unaware doesn&rsquo;t make you any less or being aware doesn&rsquo;t make you any more important, the fact is that it&rsquo;s there. Audience: I think that my awareness reached that vibration I couldn&rsquo;t bear to be a human. Adano: That&rsquo;s the time you are a human being, that&rsquo;s the first time you are a human being, you begin to see what a human being is for the first time. Until you are aware of this true nature you don&rsquo;t know what human being is, &ldquo;Come let us make Man in our own image and likeness, male and female create ye them.&rdquo; Audience: Let me either clarify or muddy the waters more by saying this, I believe that every Soul is an emanation of God whether it be a light or a splendor or however you want to express it, that must live all the knowledge that there is, to know all the truths both good and bad, the depths of depravity to the essence of Saintliness before he then is resurrected and goes back to the Godliness and it would seem that looking inward and knowing that you are this essence, knowing, I don&rsquo;t mean saying, giving lip service to it, thinking, believing, suspecting, but knowing this, that then would be the essence (inaudible). Adano: It doesn&rsquo;t destroy anything, you never lose your individuality, you never lose anything, you gain everything you have, you&rsquo;re not losing anything. In fact you&rsquo;re regaining what you don&rsquo;t even begin to use yet. Audience: I would think that you would have been refined in the sense of purity, in the sense of the refining of a metal or the refining of an energy to one point and this point would be both the alpha and the omega, the full circle. Adano: Yes but that doesn&rsquo;t take away anything from you, it doesn&rsquo;t take away anything from you. Audience: It would have removed everything from me but this one essence. Adano: No no no no, as I said that would be the first time you will know you would be you&hellip; Audience: Then I would be also would be that part of God which cannot be divided, which is God, and I would cease to exist. Adano: That&rsquo;s only an intellectual experience that&rsquo;s not a reality. You are always going to be, regardless of how many times you see yourself inside of yourself and how many times you realize this Goddess is in you, you are not going to&hellip; Audience: I should hope that I was indestructible, yes. Adano: Yes, you&rsquo;re not going to go no place. That&rsquo;s why Paul says, &ldquo;I live and die daily in it.&rdquo; Audience: I wouldn&rsquo;t go any place but I would be everywhere. Adano: Well that&rsquo;s what it is. Audience: May I ask the question&hellip; Adano: That&rsquo;s what it is, omnipresence. Audience: (Inaudible) there are many points to God, that is God exists in many places in the form of points. The solar logos, the planetary logos, these are way beyond me and because I think of God as being a sort of a hierarchy, like the army system and yet these are all points in the divinity, the divinity exists everywhere and I hope to become one of those but in fact I am one of the points known as a monad in some nomenclature but as you said I&rsquo;m not fully conscious of this position but becoming conscious of it doesn&rsquo;t make me less human any more than becoming conscious of a position makes a solar logos less in charge of this solar system or a galactic logos less in charge of a galaxy yet they&rsquo;re all one with God. 0:40 I mean this presupposes a definition of God which is even beyond me and I can&rsquo;t imagine that I would lose my humanity. There are Masters who are as Gods to me and yet they have elected to stay with humanity as humans as teachers. Audience: I was simply just trying to define the level of the vibration of this knowledge, where is this level? I mean is it the essence in the end or is it a step along the way? Audience: It&rsquo;d be so hard that you can no longer exist in a human form. Audience: I mean how can you know something without knowing at all? If you realize that you are oneness with God, this seems to me to be the end and also the beginning. Adano: No no no. Audience: Well if you leave humanity, you will not cease to exist. If you reach this point you will leave humanity. Audience: I would think you would no longer be human. Adano: Well you see the thing is this, let me put it this way, when you&rsquo;re sound asleep are you man or woman? Audience: I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any real point to discussing that, I think I&rsquo;m both but sure I&rsquo;ve been a woman in previous incarnations and I&rsquo;m probably certain I will be again. Adano: But that doesn&rsquo;t prove that you are a man or a woman. Audience: I&rsquo;m neither, I happen to occupy a man&rsquo;s body at this time. Adano: Yes but the thing that occupies, what is it? Audience: Pardon? Adano: The thing that occupies, what is it? Audience: It&rsquo;s electrical energy. Adano: All right, has it got form? Audience: Yes. Adano: All right is it positive or negative? Audience: It should be balanced. Adano: All right, there any end to it? Is there any start to it? Audience: I hope not. Adano: So if there&rsquo;s no start, no end, aren&rsquo;t you it already? That doesn&rsquo;t detract you from being a human being yet. Audience: I&rsquo;m not completely convinced of it. Adano: You see this is where you have to experience it. See that&rsquo;s why they say it&rsquo;s only through the experience that Paul&hellip; Audience: In the first place the golden light must be out of our realm of spectrum because we do not have a golden light in the spectrum. When you break up white light there is not a gold light. Adano: But until you experience it, then it will be there. That&rsquo;s why Paul says, &ldquo;I rebuke you,&rdquo; meaning the world &ldquo;in your rejoicing&rdquo; your involvement through the five senses &ldquo;for I, Paul, live and die daily in this consciousness.&rdquo; He says he&rsquo;s able to go in and out of this mechanism, like the current coming in and out of a bulb when it&rsquo;s turned on and off by the will, the switch. Audience: I like you, I realize certainly without a question of the doubt that this is only one step. I also have died and come back to this body and it was very nearly the same experience you had. Adano: So there&rsquo;s no end to yourself you&rsquo;re always there. Audience: But it seems from your progression and your development of your thesis that you were telling me that this looking inward and finally seeing the truth would have necessarily (inaudible) because it seems to me this is what you would see when you pass from this plane on to the next plane. Adano: Yeah all right let me ask you one simple question. If you were going on a journey to a foreign country, you had no maps, no one to inform you when you get there, would you know you&rsquo;ve got there? Audience: If I were completely outside of any recognizable frame of reference, I don&rsquo;t know if I would or not. I would have to look to what I had with me when I got there to find out if I knew I was there. Adano: Right and it will all be relative to what you carry with you. Audience: Your frame of reference, yes. Adano: So in pure energy would be the same result, pure consciousness will be the same result, that&rsquo;s why we never lose anything, we take ourselves into the pure consciousness and the pure energy. Solve it? Good, this is what it is all about, we take ourselves to it. You see the Divinity is pure consciousness and pure energy, it&rsquo;s only modifying itself to suit our relative frame. That&rsquo;s why we can never lose our identity or our humanistic qualities or anything, we&rsquo;re never going to lose anything, in fact we&rsquo;re gaining the the trueness of it. Audience: I hope I&rsquo;m more precious than that. Adano: Oh yes, see the thing is the preciousness of the humanistic function of our nature is based on the fact that we can generate love, we have this quality within us to generate it and if we can generate it whenever we are involved in the pure consciousness and the pure energy, we will be constantly generating love to the frame of reference that we came from. Audience: We can also generate hate. Adano: Right so the thing is we take it into the consciousness so there is no loss or any depreciation of yourself because that&rsquo;s why the Masters are saying to us when we realize the thing that we are not going to be free from anything, this is an illusion to think that you&rsquo;re going to be freed from responsibilities or free from human qualities or free from human condition, no. We are going to be freed FOR them, in other words if you never had responsibility before, you&rsquo;ll get them now and if you never had the time to be a human being, this is the time you&rsquo;re really going to experience what it is to be human. In other words if pain never bother you now, this is going to show you what the human body can take or what you can&rsquo;t take. In other words you&rsquo;re going to be forced into greater conditions, not with the sense of self-destruction or sense of devaluation of yourself, it is a sense of establishing the quality of yourself. You see you&rsquo;re establishing the humanness of yourself, you see why did he make Man or why did he take an organism and put consciousness into it? It was only to establish the humanness of it so that it can demonstrate divinity. See God could do without us you know, if you want to put it that way but because he became us you see. When we say he became us, it&rsquo;s very hard to comprehend at times: pure consciousness and pure energy slowed down and manifested itself as matter and within this manifested form it endowed itself with the capacity to organize. Now in the organization it gave it choice either to depreciate or appreciate, to degenerate or regenerate. Now since we don&rsquo;t know how to regenerate, we first have to degenerate, we always destroy ourselves first before we build ourselves up so we think we are not humans by trying to be non-human to another human being and this is our first attempt to humanism or a first attempt to rediscover ourselves as human beings. So we say that by hitting him on the head it will make me more human because when he hits me back I&rsquo;ll find out what it is to be hit in the head but this is the first approach we go by. Audience: Do you feel that as every molecule must be balanced, that every Soul must also seek this balance by the positive and negative through all the experiences and through all the passages from one plane to the next and when this isn&rsquo;t in perfect balance and in perfect growth and in perfect truth, it is incomplete. Would you say this is reasonable at this time, the state of our knowledge. 0:50 Adano: That is from the mind&rsquo;s view, that is not from the Soul&rsquo;s view. Remember this, &ldquo;God breathed into Man&rdquo; or &ldquo;Consciousness vibrated upon organism, and organism became a living Soul.&rdquo; Audience: Say that again. Adano: &ldquo;Consciousness vibrated upon organisms and organisms became a living Soul or an organism became a living Soul.&rdquo; In other words God breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul, Man did not become a living mind or a living body. The scripture was explicit and if we say it&rsquo;s not that, then we can say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use that as a reference point for the statement.&rdquo; Let us observe from research. Audience: I could be mistaken but I don&rsquo;t believe that that&rsquo;s the philosophy of Edgar Casey. Adano: Edgar Casey never said that &ldquo;Man had a Soul&rdquo; he said &ldquo;Man was Soul I&rsquo;ve read Casey too and he was a firm believer that Man was Soul. In fact he went even further to make&hellip; Audience: But the Soul came first then into the organism, he looked the organism over pretty closely before he went into it. Adano: Again we&rsquo;re talking something different. You see what Casey is inferring there is something different, you&rsquo;re talking of reincarnating into an organism. Audience: We can&rsquo;t get away from this. Adano: I&rsquo;m talking of the start of the structure of Man, in the very structure of Man, he is Soul. Now reincarnating is involved with his mind because it&rsquo;s only through the attachment in your mind and that attachment fed by the life energy, do you reincarnate. If there is no attachment in that mind of yours, the life energy has nothing to feed on, it has nothing to pour itself into, you first have to have an idea for the mind to latch onto. That&rsquo;s why I said before when the Master Jesus left his disciples there was no idea of attachment in his mind. Now in my experience I had an attachment in my mind, I didn&rsquo;t have an attachment in my life energy, my life energy fed the idea in my mind that I had a business, three people to support and maintain work and open up next day and bills to pay, that was my mental attachment. Now as far as my life was concerned that would be the end of me, stop the breath, but what would happen to Mr. Baurice here? The cops will have to come in and haul away a dead individual and this again would be an attachment to what I feel for them in the physical frame. See what is in the mind and what is in the life principle are two different things all together. Audience: How old were you when this happened? Adano: Oh in 1952, I was 32. Audience: It&rsquo;s pretty hard to phrase the question, I guess the answer is there always are attachments but even if you seem to die without attachments, you do not reincarnate anyway in order to learn lessons you have not planned. Adano: Yeah don&rsquo;t get me wrong, maybe using the word reincarnating and resurrecting we&rsquo;re using it in two different aspects of Paul. Reincarnating occurs faster then the resurrecting principle, Masters resurrect and Masters reincarnate. Now they don&rsquo;t reincarnate because they have any attachment in their mind, they are strictly a voluntary principle that comes into a body either by one of four methods: the one method is that the moment they&rsquo;re born and that&rsquo;s the very instant they&rsquo;re born, they have the total memory of all their past lives, they don&rsquo;t lose that because they are Masters already, they know it all the way till they grow up and take over the the Mastery of themselves in the physical world. Then they have a second way to be born in which they are born by immaculate conception or what you call extrasensory insemination. Then they have a third way to be born that is by direct materialization. And then there&rsquo;s a fourth way in which they&rsquo;re born, that is by a normal birth in which they recall just one or two incarnations and then open up after. Now if they are not realized, they will be born but they will not recall an incarnation, they couldn&rsquo;t recall anything, they&rsquo;re not realized. Now once they decide to come back to use a physical frame, they can pick any frame they want to come back and they&rsquo;ll pick a cripple and come back in it, only because they have a particular purpose in it, there is no desire on their part. Let&rsquo;s say for instance the level of intellect has reached such a condition among certain people where they are so inhuman to each other, where there is no real hope among the crying mothers or daughters or sons or Fathers, then a consciousness that will lift them up will decide now and the lowliest of all and be born there just for the sake of giving them inspiration to pull them out. Now this consciousness can perceive already what may happen, there may be a cataclysm in the next 20 years or 30 years to come that will wipe them all out and the consciousness will decide now because of the incurred hatred and the intense emotional pull, these people are setting up psychic waves, because thought is energy already, that will trigger off or fracture off this cataclysm because a stone is no different because it&rsquo;s still consciousness is involved and a Master consciousness knows this, that if they don&rsquo;t help that level of evolution, it&rsquo;s going to destroy itself. Now maybe it was intended to be destroyed and they would not even intercede and they will recede back into cannibalism but if they do intercede and they come in, they will pick the lowliest of them, they never pick the highborn, they&rsquo;ll pick the lowliest because that&rsquo;s the one that has the most pain and aggravation to fight with because I said before through the meditative process they have achieved peace, they have achieved consciousness, and they have achieved strength. Now the fourth thing I said the extrasensory forces is a gift to them, they didn&rsquo;t go out looking for it, this is something that is added to them, they bring that with them as a bonus. Now when they come into this lowly aspect, they are coming with an inner peace, the first thing in that grieving family, this child is unusual, it seems to give the family little hope, a little peace, it doesn&rsquo;t cry too much, this child is unusual it seems to demonstrate an ability to grasp to the consciousness, again it seems to have a strength of its own, it can stand up for itself, it can stand up for the underdog, these are unusual qualities in this child. Before you know it if the parents has any degree of awareness and if they don&rsquo;t have, that very Soul consciousness is going to transmit some of its extrasensory sources to them, they may have it in the form of dreams, they may have it in form of visions, or they may have some unusual conditions occurring in their home because he&rsquo;s helping them know to lift up. So now he&rsquo;s going to be again the center of a big confusion because everyone is going to be against that entire family. Now he&rsquo;s going to help that family to gain their own strength, gain their own peace, and gain their own consciousness but he may not help them with any extensory force to make them be unusual, he may keep that for himself but he has already extended them a portion of his divinity. The environment is going to be affected by him because he&rsquo;s going to be opposing their whole way of thinking but if he&rsquo;s forced to go to school by conventional methods, he&rsquo;ll have to go to school by conventional methods and there are Masters who live today who have gone through and got their BA&rsquo;s and their MA&rsquo;s until they have complete all their educational studies and then open up themselves as Masters helping their communities. So we see that it is not so much where the Master wants to be born, it is what level of evolution that community or environment has reached that needs lifting up. If they combine the de-evaluation or they combined degeneracy, it is bringing a Master in to lift it up. You know Jesus put it this way, &ldquo;Physicians don&rsquo;t need physicians, the healthy people don&rsquo;t need a doctor, you only go to the sick people.&rdquo; You remember he says &ldquo;Why do you sit and eat with publicans?&rdquo; Well if they weren&rsquo;t sick in some form or other, he wouldn&rsquo;t be associating with them, they don&rsquo;t have to be sick with disease from a physical way, you can be sick with the wrong type of attitude you see and still this is something he has to work with. 1:00 Audience: You said before that God does need us, I think God does need us. Adano: No no no you didn&rsquo;t understand what I said. When I said &ldquo;God wouldn&rsquo;t need us,&rdquo; we wouldn&rsquo;t be here. Audience: Because God would need us. Adano: If he didn&rsquo;t need us, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here. Now see God became us, this is what you got to realize, we are the result of God. Don&rsquo;t get in your mind that this is some creature sitting on a throne making us in little clays and so forth, you know we got this particular concept, we&rsquo;re stuck with it until we are free from it. The divine principle is pure consciousness and pure energy at the same time but when these two forces react it becomes matter, so we see it as a material form. That&rsquo;s why he said, &ldquo;Come let us make Man in our own image and likeness,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t put three things together, two things to make the third thing. Man was the result of image and likeness, image is the atomic principle, likeness is consciousness, without this consciousness you cannot comprehend and without the atomic principle you&rsquo;re not here and you are the result of these two things. God is not two, God is one manifesting as a result of three things: body, mind, and spirit then if you want to put it that way, as three things so we say he&rsquo;s a trinity. We are seeing the result in ourselves of these forces, the third part is this result, the self, the physical self is the result. This physical self is the third part, it is a result of consciousness and energy coming together ending up as a third part. Now if it doesn&rsquo;t have these two forces pushing again to bring this third part into existence, this third part is not there. Now you take science and science starts to break down the third part, it returns back to the first two parts. Every scientist will try to break down the third part which is matter now we&rsquo;re looking at, ends up in energy and consciousness. The energy is gone away into the atmosphere as pure current but then he realizes there had to be an intelligence to hold the thing together so that is consciousness, the moment he realizes there&rsquo;s intelligence involved, this consciousness, so he can&rsquo;t seem to get out of the three things, you see, so we know that we are the result of this force. Now we don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I am God&rdquo; because then right away if I say &ldquo;I am God&rdquo; then you&rsquo;re thinking of somebody sitting there, I am the result of this force, that&rsquo;s why when you go into yourself you begin to experience this result, that&rsquo;s why we say you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re achieving a state of at &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; with it. Now you don&rsquo;t lose anything, most people think they&rsquo;re losing everything you know, well I&rsquo;ll show you what I mean. Here&rsquo;s a spoonful of water from the ocean and I throw it back in the ocean, has the spoonful of water lost its water-ness, has it lost its wetness, has it lost the chemicals that it came out from? It&rsquo;s still there, (inaudible). Now if you have the ocean you have waves that are big and have waves that are small, now which are the more important waves, the ones that are big or the ones that are very small? There&rsquo;s a slight difference, not in size but in quality. Those that are big have much wind in it and those that are closely floating right on the surface are identified with it, so we say the waves that are rippling are identified with the thing because it&rsquo;s closer to the water action, whereas the one is jumping up is not so closely identified. Now but they haven&rsquo;t lost anything you see. Now the closer you are to the realization of God, you are rippling, the further you are away from the realization of God you are tidalizing, you&rsquo;re getting bigger and bigger see. That&rsquo;s why we say that Man has an ego but spiritual people don&rsquo;t want to impress nobody because that&rsquo;s not their purpose, they are strictly trying to identify you see. They are trying to identify but in the identifying they are not going to lose anything, you know this is the hardest thing for a person to realize when he starts out looking inside, that he&rsquo;s going to lose his identity, he&rsquo;s going to lose his personality. You don&rsquo;t lose anything in fact you discover what you didn&rsquo;t have, what you really should have is the first time you&rsquo;re discovering these things that these are all yours, you&rsquo;re discovering something else. You see another thing is you cannot live in that high state constantly, you cannot be putting food into your mouth to fill your stomach all the time, remember this is also like spiritual food, this constant &ldquo;at one-ment&rdquo; is something that you have to immerse in. Now you have the whole ocean in front of you and you go swimming in that ocean, do you try to swim across the ocean? Audience: I would think if you were in constant meditation as it seems that there are some philosophies that think the more you meditate, the more you meditate, the more you meditate, and so you spend your life in meditation, it seems to me a sterile existence because what is meditation without the works that the realization is bringing? Adano: Well this is what we&rsquo;re trying to point out, we must realize what we&rsquo;re pointing out, what passes for meditation may not be what meditation really is yet. Now, what meditation is supposed to do, this is something different, you cannot sit down and meditate all the time just as you cannot be active all the time, it&rsquo;s part and parcel back and forth, there&rsquo;s a reason why you meditate a certain portion and you work a certain portion. Now those images or places where you&rsquo;ve heard that people are sitting constantly in meditation never did happen. In the real facts that are being revealed that individual is not sitting totally all the time in meditation, if anyone went in their presence you&rsquo;ll find out that he may be only there for a few hours, he get up and do something else, very few of them would be meditating more than 24 / 36 hours steady. Some people say some of these individuals are spending their whole life in meditation but when you do assess the facts and stay with them to see if they&rsquo;re really spending their whole life in meditation it&rsquo;s not really true because they have to feed themselves in some form, so it is not really what we think it is. Now we can get pretty hung up on this term meditation and not really be meditating, see because sitting down and closing your eyes is no proof that you are meditating, your mind can be wandering, you see. Now what you are trying to do in meditation is to experience that you are here and as I said the first three things you want to experience: peace, consciousness, strength. The fourth thing is a bonus, that is the extrasensory forces come to you, you don&rsquo;t have to look for them, they come. The first three things are personal disciplines on one&rsquo;s nature and that is what you are accomplishing in the meditation, you are actually sitting down and acquiring this inner consciousness, inner peace. Now we can sit down here tonight and meditate for about 10-12 hours and many of us may not get anything and some of us will get something, yet we can sit down and meditate for 15 minutes and everybody can get something, or none of us will get anything, you see so again it is how we react inside. Well conversation don&rsquo;t help us to experience meditative and only by doing it that&rsquo;s why I would like us to really get a little meditation now so we can really know what we are doing inside, see. 1:10 And unless you go into it and start to feel it, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re trying to work for. No one can say what he is going to feel in it until he experiences it, then he knows what he is experiencing, that is what he is striving for to experience. Audience: One of my main interests is hypnosis and extrasensory perception, do you believe that this could be the route to true meditation? Adano: No, I&rsquo;m not laughing at the thing, I&rsquo;m just thinking of myself, saying the same thing to myself years ago too, that that could have been the route. I had to learn the hard way too. You see we get hung up on certain unfulfilled psychological want or needs, the need for experience, the need for demonstration, the need for some attraction getting gimmick in the consciousness, not that I say you personally want that but this is something the consciousness seems to crave for. It&rsquo;s a strange phenomena and in this form that we have to overcome. Self-hypnosis, nothing is wrong with it, people use it, suggestion, you reinforce your confidence in yourself in many things as a form of therapy it&rsquo;s good. Extrasensory perception is good but where&rsquo;s the peace of mind, where is the awareness? Audience: Wouldn&rsquo;t this be heightened by hypnotic suggestion? Adano: When we&rsquo;re talking of awareness there&rsquo;s a different type of awareness I&rsquo;m talking about, it is a level of consciousness. Now this consciousness in which the individual sees creation as it is, for the first time he actually perceives the atomic structure from this very little brain of his. This is an unusual quality that&rsquo;s why the Masters say it has nothing to do with hypnosis, has nothing to do with extrasensory perceptions or any attempt in the psychic world that when the person reached this level of awareness, everything he sees, he sees it as it is for the first time. Now he will see what the next man will make but he&rsquo;ll never interfere and say &ldquo;here you&rsquo;re going to make a mistake with that invention.&rdquo; He will see the man&rsquo;s attempt to make the mistakes, how many attempts that man will make before that particular law of creation is revealed but he cannot interfere, he&rsquo;s strictly an observer, as I say he&rsquo;s a first witness for God then. That&rsquo;s where they got the word Jehovah Witness. He is a true witness now, he&rsquo;s witnessing creation as it is going on, he&rsquo;s witnessing the thing as it is but his purpose is to identify, his purpose is to be at-one. Now he knows he has a purpose of being alive too, he knows where his purpose comes in, he sees his purpose and he doesn&rsquo;t fight his purpose because sometimes his purpose may not be to what he wants or what he needs, it may be something very disconcerting to him, something very aggravating and frustrating to him too, something that will really tear up more people and then do any good as far as he&rsquo;s concerned, many people will be hurt with what his role may bring. Audience: Has he lost his free will? Adano: No he hasn&rsquo;t lost his free will, he has the all with him, you see the thing is he&rsquo;s seeing the thing. Now let us say we&rsquo;re going to meditate, the first thing you&rsquo;re trying to do and this is what we wanted to do before and that&rsquo;s what we came primarily for and that&rsquo;s not for lectures, we got too involved. (Adano meditating). Keep the mind at the point between the eyebrows. (Adano chanting with group). &ldquo;Door of my heart open wide I keep for thee. Door of my heart open wide I keep for thee. Wilt thou come, wilt thou come, just for once come to me. Wilt thou come, wilt thou come, just for once come to me. Will my days fly away without seeing thee my Lord? Will my days fly away without seeing thee my Lord? Night and day, night and day, I look for thee night and day. Night and day, night and day, I look for thee night and day. (Repeated twice). Night and day, night and day, I look for thee night and day. (Repeated twice). 1:20 Door of my heart open wide I keep for thee. Door of my heart open wide I keep for thee. Wilt thou come, wilt thou come, just for once come to me. Wilt thou come, wilt thou come, just for once come to me. Will my days fly away without seeing thee my Lord?

All the doors do open themselves, all the lights do light themselves. Darkness like a dark bird flies away, flies away. Darkness like a dark bird flies away, flies away. (Chanted twice).&rdquo; &ldquo;Om Brahma, Om Vishnu, Om Shiva, Om. (Chanted many times).&rdquo; (Gap in tape)&hellip; 1:30 left as a natural catalyst to draw upon these spiritual forces, that&rsquo;s what they call the extrasensory forces, you don&rsquo;t have to develop them, Jesus said these things are added to you, these are the end results but the thing that is hard to develop or to maintain under development is peace, consciousness, and strength (inaudible) to have the capacity to hold on to all the time. Even the extrasensory abilities we don&rsquo;t hold on all the time, when you have them they just come and go and those who have them by accident, they lose them sooner or later. There are very few people who are born with it developed and very few people spend all the time trying to develop it (inaudible)&hellip; You see the thing is, once your inner consciousness begins to open every unfinished part of your nature begins to open up too (inaudible)&hellip; This is Shakespeare&rsquo;s way of saying it, &ldquo;Happiness is nowhere to be found but in a contented mind&rdquo; but what is a contented mind? It would be easier to find happiness in the contents of mind, this is a vast difference than in a &ldquo;contented mind&rdquo; because you don&rsquo;t know how to make the mind contented, there&rsquo;s no possible way you can make the mind as it contented because mind is content, but what you place is that consciousness is what leads for happiness (inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes, it is what you call the audible life stream which is the only thing. Audience: So it gets back into the computer area. Adano: Well it is a computer, the whole thing is sound, the whole universe is sound, ultrasonic (inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Because you cannot get out of the sound frequency but there is no way. What is consciousness in the first place? Consciousness, the moment it&rsquo;s demonstrated in the baby at the first breath is sound. Now the moment you&rsquo;re thinking, you&rsquo;re in sound already. Now when two clouds hit each other we see the lightning first and we hear the sound last but the sound is first before the lightning anyway because contact is sound. Just because light travels faster than sound through a certain media doesn&rsquo;t say the the sound was not there. Sound is always there because everything you see around you is crystallized sound and light. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: That is part of it, there is more to it than that. Well you first think of a sound or a word in your mind (inaudible) but that is not what it really is that is only to help the individual to focus his consciousness. There is a difference, there is a particular transference of consciousness that goes on in meditation, only a person who meditates will get this transformation. Now it&rsquo;s like two batteries, here&rsquo;s a battery and this battery is run down and you have another battery, you take a jumper cable and you put it across and we give the battery a boost and the battery will pick up and go again. In meditation this is what is occurring, there is a transference going on through the people in your room, it has nothing to do with prayer or anything. In those moments of complete silence, this is what is being transferred (inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, this is what is flowing for the individual and this is what Jesus is saying, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="1968-november-2---part-3-inner-universe">1968 November 2 - Part 3 Inner Universe</h2>
<p>Adano68_11_02Vol3InnerUniverseQ1RRNW6 - &hellip; Christ consciousness, that is the intelligence present in vibratory creation then within this blue, this is a white silver star but it&rsquo;s upside down looks like a dove descending. It almost seems like it&rsquo;s coming down to you, the descent of divinity, that&rsquo;s why they say avatar, the descent of divinity into Man. The divine is (inaudible) into Man, it&rsquo;s manifesting in Man, (inaudible) you can see it all the time in your outward universe, it&rsquo;s also inside the inner universe, what is inside is outside already and those who experienced it had no other instrument to experience it but by their own physical body, there we go again saying it was the instrument chosen to retain the principle. You see God (inaudible) principle to retain it in this physical body, that&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;and dwelt in Man.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt in Man.&rdquo; Audience: Let&rsquo;s say the color was ultraviolet (inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s the same principle: blue, gold, or ultraviolet blue or opalescent blue but it&rsquo;s in there you see, it may look to some people purplish or violet and it&rsquo;s the same you&rsquo;re seeing. You have to keep going you can&rsquo;t stop you see that&rsquo;s why Jesus says &ldquo;knock,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a door you see, you have to knock this inner door, you have to keep knocking with your consciousness until it opens. You don&rsquo;t stop that&rsquo;s why Master Yogananda used to have a whole day, Christmas Eve day meditation and he used to tell the students to meditate and meditate until they see Jesus and keep meditating until he can talk to them and he would eat a piece of Christmas cake with him. Well I remember a friend of mine she says when she first went there to meditate she heard him lecture on this thing about seeing Jesus you know and couldn&rsquo;t figure out (inaudible) and two Christmas passed and nothing happened so one Christmas she was sick with a cold and she couldn&rsquo;t go down to the meditation and all day meditation and all night meditation was going on and she sat in her bed and she decided to experiment and the Master said &ldquo;try and try&rdquo; there&rsquo;s this like a big noise in the room and she opened her eyes and she says&hellip; it didn&rsquo;t shock her, here he was standing right there and looking at her with peace and the love was flowing to her, the Master Jesus was standing there and she says &ldquo;we can see all the hair on the skin&rdquo; and she described him exactly as she saw him flesh so it stayed about 15 minutes the experience with him. You see he doesn&rsquo;t have blue eyes, he has brown eyes and he looks more the color of&hellip; like of Kate, a little darker, olive color, he&rsquo;s not completely like they clear skinned Jewish people, he looked more like Syrian type, olive color looking, and she said he wasn&rsquo;t six feet tall, just a little under six feet. She was very perceptive, her work used to be reporting and she could size up anything, she had the experience. What was peculiar about it was his hands she said, they were so delicate and the gestures and his eyes, the beard was sparse (inaudible) then she spoke about the perfume (inaudible), the perfume was so predominant, the cold left her she said after he was gone and she sat up in her room and kept on with her meditation and she says &ldquo;Two years after the past and she&rsquo;s walking along in the garden and the Master was coming around and he looked at her, &ldquo;Well did you meet brother Jesus?&rdquo; (Inaudible) the bliss came pouring down, she realized that it was the bliss was the thing she had to work for (inaudible) because the bliss she had to meditate on to hold on, this inner bliss, this inner peace. Audience: (inaudible) smelling like honeysuckle. Adano: That&rsquo;s it, once I met a Man in Austin&hellip; Audience: Is there is there anything significance, one great person or another will have a different fragrance? Adano: It&rsquo;s the same. I met him, he came all the way from Austin to see me in Tomball Texas, he arrived at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night and we started to talk about meditation, he was initiated by Master Charan Singh, he and his wife, he&rsquo;s a nuclear physicist and we start talking about meditation and I said to him, &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t teach anything but meditation.&rdquo; He said it takes him about nearly two three hours to get into meditation so I said &ldquo;Why? It shouldn&rsquo;t take you that long.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;By the time I slow down, concentrate, and repeat my holy names and so forth, it takes me three hours to even feel some kind of feeling. So I says, &ldquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be, it&rsquo;s not how long, it&rsquo;s how deep you go in.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible right here.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;You mean I don&rsquo;t have to have a special place to sit down and meditate?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;This is East, this is West, this is North, and this is South, what other place I want to sit on?&rdquo; (Inaudible). In fact there&rsquo;s no North, South, East, and West outside, it&rsquo;s all in position to where you. You&rsquo;re a nuclear physicist, you should know this by now.&rdquo; Well all right, so he sat in the rocking chair and I was sitting on the bench and I said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s close our eyes and meditate.&rdquo; Close our eyes, 10 minutes, now open your eyes, he don&rsquo;t want to come out of it. I looked at him for awhile and he comes out, he says &ldquo;Well I never been this deep in such a short period of time, what did you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did do nothing, just meditated.&rdquo; Well he left, he didn&rsquo;t tell me what he experienced. He meets a friend of mine who&rsquo;s another Charan Singh disciple and he tells this friend, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about that man, sit down with him for 10 minutes and I&rsquo;m in deep meditation and all over the room there&rsquo;s incense and perfume, honeysuckle smell.&rdquo; And he says, &ldquo;Impossible, I think he was burning it.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;But I knew when I arrived there they weren&rsquo;t doing anything, just sitting there and he wasn&rsquo;t burning anything but I smelled it.&rdquo; 0:10 So their friend is telling me what he said, I said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, just tell him meditate some more.&rdquo; Two months pass, he and his wife came to visit me in Tombul and this time I&rsquo;m sitting under a tree, right in the yard and there are three or four people sitting there, he wanted to meditate. So they came over and they sat under the tree too and we started to meditate. Meditated for about an hour and when the meditation is over, he wouldn&rsquo;t come to talk to me, he and his wife took off (inaudible) and a friend went to talk to them, he tells the friend the same story, he says &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand, there were no incense burning and this is in the outdoors. There&rsquo;s no way for honeysuckle, they don&rsquo;t have a single stuff looking like that in this yard, the the nearest tree is maybe about 50 feet away from this one tree we&rsquo;re sitting on.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I smell this perfume, this incense, so strong can&rsquo;t figure it out. Adano is doing something.&rdquo; So the friend came &ldquo;Go and ask him&rdquo; so he comes over to me, &ldquo;why is it when I meditated with you I smell these things?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me, this is the way God is showing you and your Guru is showing you that meditation is not restricted to no one particular individual.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Wherever you are gathered in that consciousness their presence can be experienced.&rdquo; In other words some people are still laboring that you have to&hellip; &ldquo;this and me and mine alone and there&rsquo;s no other way that this God is going to manifest&rdquo; and he was experiencing&hellip; and it&rsquo;s only now since he went back to India, he&rsquo;s getting this experience in his house now and Guru is helping him to experience it but his Guru was showing him that it had nothing to do you see that God&rsquo;s presence and love flowing to them. You know you hear these things, I don&rsquo;t try to do these things because first thing, there&rsquo;s no way you can do it, you just got to meditate. If God wants to give this man an experience of His love, good and fine. Anyway a year after a magazine came out from SRF saying what Paramhansa Yogananda had said way back in 1923, &ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; strange that particulate year, &ldquo;the love of God can be perceived as a perfume in the room and incense and so forth.&rdquo; Now that same year I&rsquo;ve met one of the leading disciples of Kirpal Singh, that&rsquo;s the other student of (inaudible). So I met his leading disciple here in the United States and how I met him was unusual, there were a few fellows who came to a meditation one night, a friend of mine and he says to me, &ldquo;We are students of Kirpal Singh.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you what to be, I&rsquo;m just trying say &rsquo;learn to meditate.&rsquo; All I have in this place is an hour, an hour and a half of meditation, you want to join us, good and fine.&rdquo; So we meditated and he felt uplifted, he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to meet our leader.&rdquo; So he&rsquo;s called his leader friend on the phone and tried to make an arrangement and the friend told him, &ldquo;Sorry we don&rsquo;t go out, we are loyal to our Guru (inaudible), you come to our place. So he said to the fellow &ldquo;Well look we can&rsquo;t come to your place, you&rsquo;re too far off, why don&rsquo;t you meet us at our place.&rdquo; I just wanted to meet the man. So the next day there was no confirmation, it&rsquo;s possible that we&rsquo;ll get together, possible. The next day I&rsquo;m lying on the couch in Los Angeles in a friend&rsquo;s house, we were meditating, and he just left and went to the grocery and I was lying on the couch and I can perceive all of a sudden this person who I&rsquo;m supposed to meet, I saw him clearly in my consciousness and I saw this light in the room in my meditation and at eight o&rsquo;clock this fellow called and says, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come over, maybe they&rsquo;ll show up like they promised.&rdquo; Anyway I got dressed and we went over, they were sitting down, and a quarter to eight the doorbell rang, in walked this man with his wife and they sat down. We talked a little I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong to no school or anything, I&rsquo;m strictly meditation. If you want to join in the meditation, good and fine.&rdquo; All right, they sat down and they meditated and the room was flooded again with this perfume, this incense. We meditation for 50 minutes and we opened our eyes and they don&rsquo;t want to come out and when they came out of it the wife said, &ldquo;Our Master was here with a company of Masters,&rdquo; she knows she couldn&rsquo;t recognize who they were and he said, &ldquo;Yes, it was the funniest thing, early in the day when I meditated and I was supposed to meet you, I didn&rsquo;t want to meet you and when our friend phoned and tell me you were the person would spoke about meditation, I sat down in my study room and I&rsquo;m really meditating and I asked the Master what should I do&rdquo; and he says the Master said, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I came tonight, I wanted to see who you were.&rdquo; (Inaudible) This is the student telling me this and he sees his Master constantly, he the most advanced student in this country and the Masters manifests to him all the time, He says, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; and we met and he says to me, &ldquo;Well this is an unusual experience.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;The love of God is the greatest experience, what your Master is trying to tell you is that once you realize that God is in everything and that there&rsquo;s no one particular school that has a monopoly on Him, then you become universal minded in meditation, you don&rsquo;t restrict yourself meditation. Anyway we had a wonderful evening and they left. A year after, he went to India to visit his Guru in the ashram in India and then he came back with his wife and you know what is his philosophy now? Meditate any place with anybody you meet because he realized now when he went there, he learned the truth, that the Guru is all over, God is everywhere, there&rsquo;s no one spot in the world. So in fact he wanted to be a minister, maybe in a past incarnation he this tremendous desire, that he bought a church, a small church that was empty and rundown in a certain area in Anaheim, he bought it and remodeled it so that he could give lectures twice a week and another friend of his, they were disciples, and I used to visit them and we&rsquo;d had meditation at his house and I was telling the friend, I says, &ldquo;You know you people are very fortunate, you don&rsquo;t know how to use your good fortunate qualities with your Guru.&rdquo; 0:20 I says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to India, I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;re not going to pester your Guru with lots of questions because then your Guru is only going to give you the answers and that&rsquo;s all but if you close and tune-in to the Guru while you are in his presence, while you are there, learn to tune it to the inner consciousness then you&rsquo;ll get more.&rdquo; Well I found out that they did do it and they got more than they expected because he really poured his love into them and they admit now that when they meditate they can smell this perfume. This is the thing you see, God is always pouring his love out. Audience: How can you be sure you are attuned with the inner consciousness? Adano: No, you see the thing when you are attuned to a Master there is a particular feeling that comes over you and you can sense it very clearly and distinctly and you know that your Master is linked into you and he&rsquo;s giving you this vibration, this experience, this love you see and if you are in doubt of any spiritual experience in meditation then repeat the holy name of So Hong or Radhi Soami and if it&rsquo;s not a genuine experience, it will go away. If it&rsquo;s a mental experience, just a psychological experience it&rsquo;ll go away because it&rsquo;s not a real thing but if it&rsquo;s a genuine experience, it will stay. If you suppose you&rsquo;re seeing somebody in your meditation, if you see me or somebody and you are in doubt, then repeat the holy name, if I remain then it&rsquo;s a genuine thing, if I don&rsquo;t remain then it&rsquo;s a mental hallucination, you have proof of which you&rsquo;re experiencing. I remember one friend of mine, you&rsquo;ve heard of this fellow called Lomax who is on TV sometime, he&rsquo;s something like&hellip; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well this fella is colored commentator who creates arguments, (inaudible) so he had this girl come on his show and she would give him a reading and she really gave him a reading because everything she told him came true and he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met this woman&rdquo; and on TV that night he said, &ldquo;She said it exactly accurate, I have the data right here.&rdquo; Anyway this girl meditates and she sees these Masters and she challenges them with the holy name you know, one after the other, they don&rsquo;t go away you know. So one day she says Jesus came and she challenges him too with the holy name and she says the eyes looked at her and she says she just wanted to crawl into a hole and hide. When he opened those eyes and looked at her for a second she says she just wanted to crawl into some hole and hide. (Laughter) This is the thing, if it is a genuine experience it will stay and she says she saw all these Masters and they came with love vibrating from their (inaudible). She was a Catholic you know and she wanted to be doubly sure she&rsquo;s not involving&hellip; so she start challenging with the holy name and she says when he opened his eyes to look at her for a brief second, she said she felt like she wanted to crawl in the hole and hide, it went right through her consciousness. See that&rsquo;s what these Master are telling you that genuine experiences are things that you can rely on because you don&rsquo;t have anything to hide, teaching one truth all the time, it&rsquo;s love, the basic truth. I was telling the boys I got some flowers that they brought the last time they came down to Gretna, remember those flowers that you brought? They come from Tyler Texas, you know they are front of the picture, none of the petals have fallen off, they are all crystallized, they look like artificial flowers and it has been long time since you brought them. They just look like natural artificial flowers, like if they&rsquo;re glazed strictly from the love of the devotion that they poured into it, it is left there in the glass. I was looking at it this morning before I left, it looks like if it is being slowly glazed against its own self and you can touch it and feel the difference. Here you feel the softness, there you feel the kind of waxy coating on it and I remember Jim, you remember Jim? He saw it the other night he said, &ldquo;Boy I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this.&rdquo; He wanted to break off a petal, I said &ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t break a petal.&rdquo; Well when Yogananda was alive, there was a boy, I met him in Montreal, himself and another friend, and they were interested in meditation so they started to meditate and he was very evolved in his own way, he didn&rsquo;t know it until he began to meditate and he meditated meditated and one day he&rsquo;s meditating all by himself in the room and he says he had a vision, he saw Yogananda standing in front of a group of people and in this, he had a basket with some tangerines and he was giving everyone a tangerine and then eventually there was one he had left in his hand, he turned around and looked and he saw him standing in the background and this is a dream he says he&rsquo;s having. Anyway he says Yogananda reach out and hand him the tangerine. Now he bit into part of the tangerine and kept the other part in his left hand and the dream ended there and he&rsquo;s sound asleep and he wakes up and his friend comes to wake him up and he opened his hand and there&rsquo;s a half a tangerine (inaudible) and the room is filled with the smell of tangerine and his friend said, &ldquo;Where did you get that from? Where did you buy it?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy it, I dreamt the thing or did I really dream it?&rdquo; And that portion that he didn&rsquo;t eat you know it didn&rsquo;t rot, yeah it didn&rsquo;t rot, and this boy was working as an orderly in the hospital. Now this is a peculiar thing, there was a doctor that is a student of Master Yogananda and when he was at SRF he was doing his postgraduate studies and in that same hospital and he was from France, French doctor, and he didn&rsquo;t know who the doctor was and he&rsquo;s walking along the corridor day and he saw a doctor come along the hallway and the doctor walk and stop, looked at him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do too much Kriyas you know&rdquo; and walked off and he ran behind the guy and asked him &ldquo;Know how did he know he&rsquo;s doing Kriyas?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a disciple of Yogananda. Now keep it quiet and go about your duties (Adano laughs) and it was in the same hospital and then he said afterwards he recognized that face of that doctor as one of the men that he was telling the dream that got the tangerine. Well when he go looking for the doctor in the building and next day, they said the doctor had already left and after that he got kind of scared, it was getting too far out now for what he was experiencing. I realized that he had been a pretty bold man in a past life and just couldn&rsquo;t handle it then he moved out to Vancouver to live in Vancouver. 0:30 It&rsquo;s like another friend of mine, you&rsquo;ve that I&rsquo;ve mentioned of George, here&rsquo;s a person who has a link with Babaji.  He never knew anything with yoga, the first time he came in contact with Autobiography of a Yogi, &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s my friend Babaji&rdquo; just like that. Well you know you think the person is joking and one day he&rsquo;d had a bottle of rum he brought from the islands and he wanted to give his mother a drink, they in one of these old fashioned French homes, I was visiting with him and he had no ice, it was in the summertime, so he says &ldquo;Well Babaji I need some ice&rdquo; just like that jokingly you know and two minutes later he&rsquo;s walking on the balcony looking outside and he says &ldquo;Mum is that your ice down there?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a Sunday afternoon, she says &ldquo;No George, I don&rsquo;t buy no ice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then it belongs to the neighbor.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s 12 o&rsquo;clock in the sun, it should be melting away. He says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; he goes downstairs and he asks anybody &ldquo;Whose ice is this?&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s melting away if they don&rsquo;t pick it up. No ice cart passed in the area to bring this ice so it&rsquo;s a 50-pound block and he looks at this thing and he says &ldquo;Well if nobody don&rsquo;t want it in an hour&rsquo;s time, then I can take it, I need to have a drink.&rdquo; Well we were all looking at this condition, an hour passed and in the sun a 50 pound block would pretty melted away right? He goes down, George is a very healthy man, he picks up the ice and starts walking up to the balcony with the ice but where the ice was just the edge, the outline of where the ice was resting on the concrete, it was the mark right there, and he came up with the ice and the mother says, &ldquo;George, it doesn&rsquo;t below to you, put it back, that&rsquo;s stealing you know.&rdquo; She was a very staunch believer in her religion, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s stealing son&rdquo; this man&rsquo;s about nearly 58 years of age, he&rsquo;s still her son you know. (Inaudible) break the ice, he had a drink so I asked him &ldquo;George how did that ice feel?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like it lifted me up. I just feel like I was lifted up and I got a hunch that Babaji gave it to me, nobody owns this ice, it&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; And he was very adamant to a point you know, he says it&rsquo;s Babaji who gave it to him, his friend Babaji. Well how am I gonna argue the man, he has this inner feeling? After that, every time he would say &ldquo;Babaji&rdquo; something, it seems to happen then he got scared. No more from them would he get involved it it but what was funny, of all the pictures of all the Masters in that Self-realization, he went to visit Self-realization and saw Sister Dayamata, of all the pictures that were available, the only one he acquired was Babaji and he was a photographer, he blew this picture up so big and he colored it in paint oil that that picture seemed to come alive. He said &ldquo;This is the way I see him&rdquo; and you can&rsquo;t argue with him because right when he starts, he gets like he wants to fight you. It&rsquo;s funny just to get his reaction to really what&hellip; he says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my friend, I don&rsquo;t know about you people but he&rsquo;s my friend.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the only picture he keeps and he doesn&rsquo;t meditation, he wouldn&rsquo;t meditate, I said &ldquo;Well while you have the experience, why don&rsquo;t you meditate?&rdquo; He says no, he says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can go it yet.&rdquo; Well I can see there&rsquo;s so much turmoil in himself you see and one day I saw him meditating and I ask him how he&rsquo;s getting along. He says to me &ldquo;Well I can see what you say about meditation being pretty tough, I prefer to call on Babaji. If Babaji takes me through the meditation ok, but I won&rsquo;t attempt it in this incarnation, it&rsquo;s too tough.&rdquo; Well these are some unusual things of these Masters but in a case like his you see I could see his case because how old the man is in relation for when Yogananda came and how did Yogananda come to be in this part of the world and what brought him to this part of the world and Babaji saying to Sri Yukteswar, &ldquo;These vibrations are already coming from the West&rdquo; to him, he&rsquo;s picking them up so these Masters are already seeing certain disciples or connections with certain souls who they have a connection with that are already living in a Western body and this man is an artist and he could really paint and his family comes from a line of wonderful artists and early in the morning at 3 o&rsquo;clock that&rsquo;s his time, he goes to paint. He sits down in front of the empty canvas and then concentrate for maybe a whole hour looking at an empty canvas (inaudible) lost in it, then he starts to paint just like that but I realize that this man had some connection but he was afraid of how far he&rsquo;s gone, what was happening, because any time he called on this or think, in the Autobiography it says, &ldquo;If you repeat the name of Babaji with devotion, instantaneously a blessing will come&rdquo; and he would say the thing just jokingly and it would happen and this is what got him so scared because then he realized how he lived in relation to why this thing should happen. Audience: It&rsquo;s a pretty powerful connection he had. Adano: He sure did and he still has this connection with the Master but he doesn&rsquo;t use it no more because he says he&rsquo;s not ready for it but he&rsquo;s holding on to the connection, when the time comes he will sit down and meditate. See his mother is still alive and she&rsquo;s very ill. Audience: Did you say they&rsquo;re in the north somewhere? Adano: No she&rsquo;s living in California, she moved down from Canada, they used to live in Canada and she moved down because of the winter, they&rsquo;re living out there in California now. Audience: Pretty severe. Adano: Yes it&rsquo;s severe, 10 below zero, it ain&rsquo;t so nice like sunny Dallas. Audience: I&rsquo;ll tell you I don&rsquo;t think I could take living in the north again that far. Adano: No my company is up there, I have to go there to work, I have to go back in the office you see. Wherever the company sends me, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m working. Audience: Cold or otherwise. Adano: Cold or otherwise, since last month, October in fact, my boss has been nominated the head of the federal Power Commission and corrosion investigation so and that kinda changed the whole picture now. He called me last night, &ldquo;Well Charlie Chan, you&rsquo;re my number one hatchet man.&rdquo; He has to go in and check all the corrosion so I says &ldquo;Yes Mr. Ness of the Corrosibles.&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible)&hellip; I meditated all night and I felt like you were coming here. I said &ldquo;if that car can&rsquo;t get fixed by Saturday morning&rdquo; (inaudible), then Roger called me and said you were here. Adano: She&rsquo;s in San Antonio attending a teachers convention. You see this is how it works actually&hellip; Audience: I kept saying what you said, &ldquo;Divine Mother willing&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll get out of here (inaudible) in the right place at the right time. Adano: And that is how it works you see the Divine Will is in everything. See years ago I used to force myself into what I want to do it, I want to do it you know and nothing stops me. I realized too many knock downs and you gotta wake up one day and change your whole attitude around and from that time on then I realized that God has a plan already set up like a big jigsaw puzzle and our lives, each one of us, fit in into this plan. Audience: There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any friction, you just kinda flow with it. 0:40 Adano: Right and that is the whole purpose. You see abundance, possessions, there was a time in each one of our lives when we had a surplus of it, where we abused it, or hoarded it up and never shared it, you understand, or we didn&rsquo;t know how to acquire it so we&rsquo;re thrown back constantly into the world stream strictly to realize this but we&rsquo;re realizing it from the ego standpoint wanting to do it ourselves, wanting to solve the problem ourselves. Now when the principle that has been set up that the divine is taking care of that, that&rsquo;s why Jesus says, &ldquo;Do not pray like the Gentiles do who want something because Father never knows what you need already with a lily don&rsquo;t plant or anything, these things go on, rather seek the kingdom of God which is in you, rather go inside and all these things will be added to you.&rdquo; So that is learning to fit yourself into divine will. Now Master Yogananda clarified it by saying &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re trying to do daily is to be at the right place, at the right time, for the right experience and everything will take care of itself.&rdquo; He says that in the first part of it it&rsquo;s a little difficult to adjust because you are bringing with it unfinished karma. Well the moment it starts to make the adjustment then the karma begins winding itself up then your whole life changes, then you begin to see now what Jesus meant, &ldquo;You have life abundant,&rdquo; flowing, you see this is life flowing through your mechanism. Audience: Well you know early in life it seemed to me that the concept I had was you were given a mind, you are supposed to instigate all things. In other words if you&rsquo;re sitting back and letting some other person make the decisions it&rsquo;s as though you&rsquo;re being weak-willed, willy nilly kind of a person. Adano: As I said, &ldquo;best laid plans of mice and men often turn to ridicule&rdquo; but I could never see mice making plans. That&rsquo;s the only part of that statement I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend, mice making plans, I think we are the mice. Now it is a part of our nature that no matter if it&rsquo;s here or any part of world, we always seem to be ridiculed or pushed into wanting to do or take over the reigns, grab the bull by the horns and twist it and turn our destiny, man is the master of his destiny but I think we got a wrong comprehension of the thing. Audience: It&rsquo;s that razor&rsquo;s edge between discrimination and letting go or allowing these things to happen because you don&rsquo;t let go of the mental powers entirely because you those have to still operate. Adano: Yeah, see go back to Carl Jung, you see Carl Jung made this his whole life of investigating the religious experience, what he called the super consciousness or super-ego, he was the only one that was interested in this part and he, in his summation in psychiatry for mental health or what you say successful living, said that &ldquo;Until we learn to turn over our basic self or subconscious self to this higher self, we really don&rsquo;t fit into the scheme of things, we&rsquo;re always going to be a misfit.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;and this is a challenge to the Germanic mind and the Anglo-Saxon mind whereas to the Oriental mind this is part and parcel of his makeup.&rdquo; You see in the Germanic an Anglo-Saxon mind he is already trained into a thinking process that he has to take the bull by the horn and charter the course and successful living is not the acquirement of things he says, it is the art of how to adjust. He says &ldquo;and this is what you&rsquo;ll find in those minds, people who have got this ability that they fit into things and their mental health are better.&rdquo; Audience: And is that adjusting (inaudible). Adano: Yes it is, it is letting. Audience: You can see how anybody with a Russian nature would say if you&rsquo;re doing that, you&rsquo;re just a weak sister. Adano: Well it&rsquo;s true, you see they point these things out to hit at the ego but in the end it is what counts is the results of how you adjust is what counts. You see because many great works of art or inventive discoveries were never actually the result of slow methodical research, they were all the result of accidents. Audience: There are not many people who are trained in that particular line of thinking or business. Adano: Well take for instance the discovery of penicillin, penicillin was not something that was set out to be discovered, Dr. Fleming did not set out specifically with a train of thought to discover penicillin, he was looking for a certain substance to do a certain particular work and years went by his research work but to no avail. One day he turns up in his refrigerator a piece of old cheese that had molded and didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it, he was just gonna throw it out and he said just then then under the microscope he noted some organisms and he took these organisms and he placed it in the same batch of stuff that he was working on to see what these organisms would do and he noticed these organisms began to eat up all the rest in that batch and they were the only ones that remained, result of an accident, and take your Salk vaccines is the same thing. If they had specifically set out to say they&rsquo;re gonna land at the right point, it&rsquo;s never true. Now Columbus was the same thing, he set out to look for India and where did he end up? He end up here. Now this would be exactly in relationship (inaudible) tonight, going to a place, not knowing where you&rsquo;re going but only when you arrive using the frame of reference to the things you brought. Columbus call the people here Indians, he was going to India, not knowing what India looked like first place, he was searching for a shortcut route but ended up in an alien place and everybody that walk along was an Indian because they look a little dark. Now if he&rsquo;d met a bunch of Cherokees like Eric the Red met, what would he call them? The big squabble is now did Columbus discover America or Eric the Red? Now the Cherokees are fair skinned people. Now where Columbus landed they were darker people, he landed in the southern part, this is a peculiar phenomena of nature. The northern people of every country seem to be clearer or fairer and those in the South always seems to be darker, the pigmentation like that. Now this is something doctors are realizing today, that pigmentation is due to location, weather, and the diet. Your northern Orientals are clear, your southern Orientals are all dark. Audience: Did the American Indians call themselves Indians? Adano: No, they never knew the word Indian until they were called that by the Spaniards and the French and the British were the people after Columbus. See Columbus was the first man that call them Indians and the French writings that I&rsquo;ve read, it was called the &ldquo;savage, savage nation&rdquo; you see savage means primitive in French, it doesn&rsquo;t mean what we call savage. When they said the man was a savage, in French it doesn&rsquo;t mean that. In English a savage is a person who has no culture or anything but in French &ldquo;savage&rdquo; meant a primitive, a native of a land. So there&rsquo;s a French author who listed the 722 tribes of the &ldquo;savage&rdquo; nation, that&rsquo;s what he called it, the whole area was the &ldquo;savage,&rdquo; the primitives of the Americas and he listed how many of them there were, there were over 722 tribes. Audience: I know we were looking at this in a museum up there of the various tribes, I didn&rsquo;t realize how many, many different tribes there are. Adano: Well you takes &ldquo;agan,&rdquo; you say the man is a Pagan is Italian for country cousin, that&rsquo;s how you get your word &ldquo;Pag-an&rdquo; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s nothing but a Pagan&rdquo; &ldquo;Paganistic,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s your country cousin he&rsquo;s a pesant you see this is the same thing, we&rsquo;re stuck with words and then before you know it, it&rsquo;s distorted to the meaning of the thing. Like your barbarians, they come from Barbaria, now the Barbarians were not barbarians, they were people who lived in another part of the country and they invaded certain areas in their search for land and cattle and so forth and before you know it, anybody who is looking for cattle or land without paying for it was a barbarian. Audience: So it came to have even a fiercer meaning. Adano: Yeah, like the Vikings you see. Audience: This word business is one that can be very misleading and I daresay that looking back on our twentieth century, English is going to be quite an experience, they will not know what they&rsquo;re talking about. Adano: It&rsquo;s changing so fast you know. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: There was a good book I read the other day, it&rsquo;s called Googly Gook, how to read, speak, and talk Googly Gook. This is a professor of English who devised this thing he says, &ldquo;Googly Gook is a way to communicate the people who don&rsquo;t want to understand too much.&rdquo; Audience: I wonder if that doesn&rsquo;t take about 80% of the Americans. Adano: He says, &ldquo;Now when you communicate in Googly Gook, you make complicated words short&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;like instead of night, nite. Nity, she&rsquo;s wearing her nity this night.&rdquo; He goes on to make words that they&rsquo;re all one word making up many other words out of it and he calls it Googly Gook. Now it&rsquo;s interesting because he says we&rsquo;re gonna be finding this coming up constantly, words will be shortened up. Audience: It&rsquo;s been involved in various advertisement now to the point where children, well I know for instance the word &ldquo;cat,&rdquo; half the time they&rsquo;ll spell it with a &ldquo;K&rdquo; and the child doesn&rsquo;t know whether cats is &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;K&rdquo; anymore unless he just had specific training. You read billboards and advertisements&hellip; Adano: Well the argument you see in this book, this is where Googly Gook comes in, it is trying to communicate without having to use a formal way of spelling, you understand, for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want to understand too much and he&rsquo;s showing all the different examples, how we shorten all these words and then he says, &ldquo;Now the ability to say nothing with lots of words at the same time is Googly Gook.&rdquo; Audience: He has a block full of about 30-40 words and you combine them, it sounds good but it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything?&rdquo; Adano: Right, this is the same thing. Audience: When rendering a report either to your boss or to the public for that matter, big long words. Adano: Right that&rsquo;s the same thing, Googly Gook, guess what he called Googly Gook? And he invented the word himself, this is peculiar thing, how he invented this word, and one time Churchill made an issue over slang and prose you know and then&hellip; have you read his memoirs? In a portion of his memoirs, he writes in slang you know, well it&rsquo;s very well done and you wouldn&rsquo;t know if you never knew what the slang was because he made the comments all in pertaining to how the English people in England would use the slang. To an American it doesn&rsquo;t appear as slang, it appears as prose but to the Englishman in England the way it&rsquo;s written they call that slang and he&rsquo;s showing how this condition can occur during the war, that they had to use words that were totally not dignified English but became slang and he was a quite a master of words himself as an author, let alone a writer. Well here&rsquo;s a typical example that this professor used, that he says Churchill was a master of Googly Gook too, he says when he told Hitler &ldquo;We will fight you the hills, we will fight in the street, we will fight you everywhere&rdquo; he says &ldquo;before you know it, Churchill was fighting himself&rdquo; because the way that the thing goes around, if you keep repeating the thing over and over, he was a man fighting with himself and he says this will kind of scare anybody let alone Hitler. He gave wonderful examples of the thing, how to recognize this Googly Gook. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: (Inaudible) my friend, is that your new role? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: (Inaudible, then gap in tape) &hellip; the body&rsquo;s ability to utilize its oxygen in order to revitalize yourself. Well there the doctor did some research on gerontology, the science of aging of the cells, and he is pointing out that because the body is incapable of utilizing oxygen, its process of aging is speeded up and those people who know how to breathe deeply and he made some researches in the Orient now and because this was the part that intrigued him, the yoga breathing. He&rsquo;s found that these people don&rsquo;t age or their cells don&rsquo;t seem to break down as the ones who don&rsquo;t know how to breathe and there&rsquo;s a definite connection between the aging, the oxygen, and a certain amino acid in the food and this amino acid is found in meat and it speeds up aging so what is interesting about it is the Yogis have always known that the art of rejuvenating the body were based on oxygenation and they&rsquo;ve always known that the meat had certain chemicals that interfere with the normal flow. Now you heard of Dr. Alexis Carrel, who write a book called &ldquo;Man, the Unknown&rdquo; and how he kept a chicken heart for 28 years? It was because the solution that he kept at him did not have the amino acid and also he was aware of the fact that oxygen was important but he never made a connection until this other doctor came along now and has made this connection in his research. 1:00 He says that the cellular functions themselves constantly flood and wash out by oxygen and in the breathing it causes the blood to flood these cells and clear it. Now if there are toxins in the cells especially this particular amino acid, it&rsquo;s called tryptophane, if it&rsquo;s found within the tissue it speeds up the aging process. Now he did that with a chicken, he took away the tryptophane amino acid from the chicken&rsquo;s diet and the chicken remained a chicken. Now a chicken is supposed to mature approximately after 21 days is born you know then in another three months the chicken is full grown. He kept this chicken for about six months as the chick, just like it came out of the shell, as soon as he replaced the amino acids it sprung this fella back, start aging got bigger and bigger until it was full size. Audience: Well in keeping it as a chicken by the same simile if you were to stop the aging process as far as the appearance is concerned, what does this do to the consciousness? Adano: Well in the chicken&rsquo;s case, he didn&rsquo;t experiment with the chicken to find out how smart the chicken could be but in the human being, it can because you see we have the same principle applying to the fifth dimensional law of Einstein. See Einstein says if you have a twin who would live on this earth and they put you in a capsule and shoot you from here to Mars and back, he would have aged while you would have remained young strictly because you went through space and came back and though it took so many light years to go and come back, he would age and not you. Audience: Why? Adano: Because you will be living in a controlled environment while he would not be in a controlled environment and if the laws of that particular relationship would bring you back intact under his control environment whereas he would not be in a controlled environment, he&rsquo;d be living strictly by his whims and his natural sensibility, therefore he will deteriorate. Audience: Only because the only way could you remain alive to Mars and back would be within this controlled environment. Adano: Right and within this controlled environment your mechanism would stay as it is. Audience: Could you have this controlled environment right in Dallas, put you in a capsule and control it. Adano: Right. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes the gravity of the Earth has one way of eliminating the pull on your mechanism but you&rsquo;re in a weightless state, that would have one thing to do with it you see, then there is no pull on your mechanism. See gravity is only a pull on a mechanism which displays weight you see, now we age not because of gravity, we age because of a certain inability to cope with the oxygen in the atmosphere and certain residues in our nutritional makeup whereas the man who is going to be in a controlled flight, his oxygen is controlled for him with certain impurities taken out of it already, his diet is controlled where those impurities are not going to be present in order for him to survive so his makeup would be different, he is not gonna age but it gets back to the thing about meditation, all these things tie in with the meditational techniques because they all hinge on the same principle but in meditation your body is oxygenating itself and when you shut down periodically in meditation, you are in a sense simulating a control function on your mechanism, you are in a sense bringing this mechanism to slow down process. Now in Kriya Yoga the Master said that the slow decarbonization of the blood helps you to utilize the added oxygen to reduce the decay of the mechanism. See in this particular aspect here&hellip; (Adano reads from Autobiography of a Yogi). &ldquo;Kriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which human blood is decarbonated and recharged with oxygen.&rdquo; This is an important part, it&rsquo;s recharged with oxygen. Now in gerontology, which is the science of aging, it&rsquo;s the inability of the cells to utilize oxygen due to the residue left in the tissues by the amino acids from meat. Now &ldquo;the atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers. By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of the tissues.&rdquo; See it&rsquo;s also aiming at the slowing down of tha aging process or the breakdown of the tissue structure. &ldquo;The advanced yogi transmutes his cells into energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir, and other prophets were past masters in the use of Kriya or a similar technique, by which they caused their bodies to materialize and dematerialize at will.&rdquo; What they trying to point out is this, that modern medicine is slowly entering into a deeper understanding of this mechanism and as Mrytle said &ldquo;what becomes of the consciousness even when you slow down these tissues, is the consciousness going to increase? Yes. Audience: (Inaudible). and I kept worrying about people coming and going, what&rsquo;s wrong, what do I need to do, and as long as it&rsquo;s on my mind I can&rsquo;t concentrate. I&rsquo;m just now relaxed to the point where I can listen. (Inaudible audience discussion). 1:10 Audience: (Inaudible) Well I&rsquo;ve gotten to the place where I would prefer to correspond by tape recorder about as well as any other way, you get the sound of the voice, you get the inflection and everything that goes with it and I know when our boy was in Korea it was so pleasant to hear his voice even though there were a little trite sayings he would say, it was quite pleasant to hear him. Which is again only an extension of the thing that could be sent firsthand once we learn it. Adano: You see meditation is a constant self-remembering too of yourself, you have to spend time with it. There is the group meditation and there&rsquo;s the individual meditation but in those periods even in a group or by yourself, you have to bring your consciousness to observe yourself, this is an observation processes. If it was in books, believe me there are lots of book written on the subject, but very few people are actually practicing the thing or doing the thing and it&rsquo;s only by doing it or getting involved with the action will discover what is not in the books, you discover of yourself what is happening inside of you. Audience: But what happens inside of you is it exactly the same thing that happens inside of me or is it only the general principle that works is the same but the actual experience is different? Adano: No, each one of us carry within our mental makeup his own set of experiences, his own set of exposure to ideas, and own set of programming and imprinting on his mind. Now (inaudible) of general common functioning between the two of us is the fact that we can both self observe ourselves. Now the set of experiences that you carry may not be the same set of experience I carry. Now this would be postnatal experiences, that&rsquo;s afterward, the set of experiences that you carry prenatally, that&rsquo;s before your birth, it not going to be the same set of experiences that I would carry prenatally before birth but in that prenatal period there are certain experiences that we may be involved which which have thrown us to be involved right now here in this postnatal condition, this after birth condition, find ourselves in this new incarnation. There may be ideas or experiences involving where we are thrown in and where we are locked in. Now it is those experiences that keep coming back that holds us together and move us towards an inner search, otherwise we don&rsquo;t remain together, we don&rsquo;t come together and we each branch off in our own inner search in another area. Now if there have been closer inner connections and the inner search has placed us where we have made definite signs of progress inside, we will see the same thing occurring right on the outside here and are brought back to it with a much deeper understanding. It&rsquo;s this self remembering principle that helps us to awaken our association, they certainly don&rsquo;t come up in our consciousness but it&rsquo;s not imagination, it&rsquo;s strictly that consciousness began to reveal now for the first time the associations that you&rsquo;ve had prior to birth and it comes back to us. Audience: But the self-remembering is for what purpose? For the purpose of making us aware of we function, for what purpose we function? Adano: Yes, remember the thing is it&rsquo;s making you remember a part of our nature that is yet untapped by our five senses, it&rsquo;s a part our nature which we are unaware of that is already functioning through the use of our five senses, that is deciding and making decisions on our outward life. Now these decisions sometimes they can be forced upon the outward life without us being capable of handling them, that&rsquo;s why when we try to remember or try to analyze ourselves, we are trying to gain a control over the flow of experiences from that part of our nature to this part of our nature. In other words we&rsquo;re only accepting so much as we can handle and meditation is to help us to cope with it so it don&rsquo;t flow too fast and we can&rsquo;t handle it too fast. Audience: In other words, we&rsquo;d be overwhelmed. Adano: See certain things comes from that realm to this realm that would automatically destroy interest in this realm and some will come that will stimulate interest in this realm, it&rsquo;s to know how to apply the brakes, or how to apply your will but it doesn&rsquo;t overdo one or the other, it keeps an even keel. Audience: I know that Gene Perkins said when he had the accident and was unconscious for three days, he was aware of where he was and didn&rsquo;t really want to come back but there is something within you that draws you back into incarnations to finish a job. Adano: Yes, there&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about, the attachment, what is the actual attachment that pulls the life current back to the body. See in my case the actual attachment that pulled me back was the fact that I had three people working for me and had some bills to pay and this was a hanging so heavy in my mind not even realizing the damage to my body. See this is the unfinished condition and you begin to realize that this can be so embedded in your consciousness that no amount of will, no amount of detachment seems to break it, it seems it has to be faced and be fulfilled. Now even when I came back into the body with the intention of fulfilling the obligation, it turned out that I had to sell the whole thing out just to pay off the bills, so they were eventually out from under it and whoever took over it either kept them or fired them and whatever value I placed on the object, I didn&rsquo;t get those values you see. I had (inaudible) lost value to get what I had to pay off. So again I am placed with a lesson to learn, that sometimes the values we place on certain things and when you&rsquo;re confronted with having to face these values, these values are not really there. That you may have to alter your entire decision just for what is it the important thing to be solved. 1:20 Audience: Are those values brought over from other lifetimes, for instance like small children and so forth who do not have parents that set obligations or cause obligation to be outstanding in the child&rsquo;s life, do they automatically seem to have some sort of life goal or purpose anyway? Adano: No, I really don&rsquo;t know. See from the experience that I went through, this is what became obvious to me, &ldquo;important things first, the more important things become important, the least important they seem to be&rdquo; because if you make an issue of the ultra importance of an important thing, sooner or later it loses its importance, other things seem to take its place that are more demanding. You find yourself confronted with much more important things and the same time then you don&rsquo;t know which one is more important than the other. So with this in view, I begin to let go now of the attachment of what is really important and do what I supposed to do. Audience: Do you mean this attachment that you were talking about that brought you back to a responsibility was personal whereas the responsibility that you mentioned that Masters feel is impersonal? Adano: Right, impersonal, highly impersonal. Audience. That&rsquo;s hard for us to imagine. Adano: Right, it&rsquo;s very hard for us to imagine how impersonal they can feel towards another human being, definitely a responsibility, that they can give of their love and compassion to make us equal to themselves. Audience: Well that much be because it&rsquo;s just so much a part of it. Adano: Right, remember this my responsibility was not based on an equality basis, these were employed people, you understand? You have to weight the thing in balance where the Master varies from my condition,  I am not seeking to make the employee the boss of my business, I employed them to give them work so that they can work and I carry on a business so there is a definite relationship that is established. A Master is not establishing no such relationship, he&rsquo;s establishing a relationship of raising you to his level to make you into a Master yourself. He doesn&rsquo;t want you to worship him or follow him, he wants to lift you up to face the reality of yourself so he has a very impersonal responsibility, not a personal one, and impersonal one. It&rsquo;s like take story, there was a lioness that was pregnant and chased some sheep and in chasing the sheep the lioness gave birth to a baby lion and the lioness died. The sheep now adopted the baby lion and nursed it and it grew up and it ate grass and howled and growled just like a baby sheep, it did not know to roar like a lion, all it did was imitate what it was exposed to. One day a huge lion came down the hill and saw the sheep and started to give chase and he roared like a lion and just then he saw this other lion was full grown running and crying just like a sheep so wondered why and he chased that particular lion and caught him by the river, caught him by the neck and the lion started to whimper like a baby sheep and he took the lion by the neck and pushed his face in the water said to him &ldquo;Look at yourself&rdquo; and he says, &ldquo;you see you&rsquo;re a lion like me and roar like a lion.&rdquo; That is the responsibility of a Master to us, he catching us by the scruff of our psychological weakness and shaping us to our spiritual heritage. Audience: He&rsquo;s out recruiting more Masters. (Laughter). Adano: You see he doesn&rsquo;t want us to be like the sheep that is still groveling in the five senses in our state of inner weaknesses. He wants us to awaken to our inner strength and the reality of ourself. Now my responsibility to these people is that they were my employees and I was not in any way trying to make them into a boss, I was simple employing them and giving them work and that was the relationship and I had this responsibility to see that these people got paid and I had to pay my bills, you follow me? Now in the case of a Master to his disciple, he is raising these people up to a different level therefore his relationship would be highly impersonal. That&rsquo;s why in the Autobiography of a Yogi, the teacher said to the student &ldquo;I will give you my unconditional love, would you give me your unconditional love?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy for a Master to say he gives us his unconditional love but it&rsquo;s not so easy for us to say we can give a Master our unconditional love. Our love to Master is always conditioned, we want something from the Master, we want cosmic consciousness or we want to have an easy life, we wants something from the Master. The Master is giving us unconditional love but we cannot seem to cope with it. Now because this responsibility is impersonal, it takes time for us as individuals to realize this impersonal-ness in it, it&rsquo;s hard for us to grasp why it&rsquo;s impersonal and it seems so cold but it&rsquo;s not. It is because it was intended to awaken us from our own delusion. Audience: (Inaudible). You see the thing is now, they say if you cannot train your own children send them to your neighbor&rsquo;s house, your neighbor will make a better mother for your child and if she wants her child to be well trained, send him to your house and you will trained him because what you will implant in his mind, his parents would not allow it to do or you would not allow him to do, what his parents would allow him to do and what she would not allow your child to do you would allow your child to do, you see? So in that way, the Romans, the Greeks, and the early Orientals used to take away the children from the parents and send them to these foster parents, sort of Godparents, that&rsquo;s what the ashrams were too you see. Take a young child, eight or nine years of age and send him away and he doesn&rsquo;t see the parents until he&rsquo;s 21. Well in the Autobiography a Yogi an example like that, Sri Yukteswar was always involved with the training of the younger children because the parents left them at the ashram and he trained them and disciplined them and eventually when they were ready to go back home, they went back home, those that remained remained but those that went back home, went back home. You see a Master can sense what would be the occupational part of the students life, he can sense if this child is gonna stay on the spiritual path or the child get married or go back to his parents or they will take up a business life or so forth and this is what he helped the person realize. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You see any responsibility that you would have which is not in the category or condition of a Master to a disciple, that attachment is gonna be personal. Now a Master, I&rsquo;ll show you why a Master relationship is impersonal, &ldquo;Do not grieve for me, grieve for yourself&rdquo; did He not say that to the people on his way to Calvary? &ldquo;Do not grieve to me, grieve for yourself&rdquo; because you are attached you see. 1:30 Their whole attachment was personal and his is not personal, he has no personality in the thing, he loved them for what they are, he blessed them and lift them up to what they can be lifted up but he had to go on for the higher realization so it may seem that Jesus, &ldquo;My gosh he&rsquo;s a Master, how can he be so harsh and cruel, don&rsquo;t grieve for me, grieve for yourself&rdquo; you see. Why did he made the comment, it&rsquo;s only because he is not involved with personality, he is involved in the impersonal self, the impersonal life all the time and it&rsquo;s this impersonal life that permits him to return back to them and to help them after the mechanism was undergone the change. You see he couldn&rsquo;t help them enough prior to his death but he can help them more after he died and in fact if he was a figment of imagination as some people wanted to claim, we have evidence after the fact of the identical imprints occurring centuries after on human beings to show that he is not a figment of imagination. The stigmata wounds are no figment of imagination because every doctor and every psychiatrist will tell you, no amount of hypnotism will produce it to the extent that it&rsquo;s gonna remain permanently. They have tried to duplicate it through hypnosis but as soon as the subject is taken out of the hypnotic condition, those things are gone, and they will never come back but not in the stigmatist, the real stigmatist who have had this impression planted on their mechanism, they&rsquo;re not in no state of hypnosis because they have measured their brain and they know these people are wide awake and conscious, they&rsquo;re definitely in a higher state of awareness and that this is a genuine thing. As I said tonight the difference between the Saint and the psychic, the psychic can duplicate many things by mental capacities but there will be no permanency in it. When a Saint transfers or a Master transfers some identification of his presence, you can rest assured that there&rsquo;s a certain degree of permanency involved all the time. Audience: Well is that what causes (inaudible) is just a step on the way, it&rsquo;s just something to go through but not to linger in? Adano: Very very good, it&rsquo;s the garden in front of the house but it&rsquo;s not the treasure box in the house. In other words here you&rsquo;re going to the garden and it&rsquo;s got beautiful flowers all around it and it&rsquo;s all made of what you call it, costume jewelry but right inside the house is where the real jewel box is. Now no person displayed the pure jewels outside of the house. Audience: Then the solution instead of working with that you would say is just more meditation. Adano: Yes and every Master will emphasize the fact that this is it you see, the Master said this in their writings &ldquo;In the early stages of meditation, this is a personal revision of your life because we have made so many different mistakes.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t know all the mistakes we made because we have to remember, to recall these things to the surface but we shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about the past lives because they&rsquo;ve already been made. In other words you&rsquo;re carrying a knapsack on your back already like the turtle you know, but don&rsquo;t worry about that, what you got to figure out now is how to revise your consciousness, how to reevaluate your consciousness, how to modify this principle so that this thing will have a chance now to work itself out. Now let me show you an idea, you have water and if you freeze it, it will float because it turns to ice but it gets heavy. If you cook it, it will evaporate then there is no more water. We have many mistakes from past behavioral patterns and if we freeze up in ourselves, that is to say if we shirk the responsibility to face them, they&rsquo;ll get heavy in us, and then it will really sink to the bottom. There&rsquo;s no possible way for us to get out of it, we will drown in our own psychological makeup but if we apply the heat of meditation, we apply our consciousness to cause it to evaporate out of us, sooner or later there is no more. Meditation as I said produces three conditions first, like fire, like all of the fires, the fire of peace because you have to struggle to get this peace, the fire of consciousness because you have to struggle to be conscious, and the fire of strength in order to overcome. Now these three fires, or these three qualities, once you bridged it, it sort of dehydrate or get rid of, burn up the accumulated patterns of our thinking for the first time we are ridding ourselves of it so it is not less meditation and it&rsquo;s not more meditation, it&rsquo;s how deep we meditate. See there&rsquo;s a big difference between how long we meditate and how much we meditate or how little we meditate, it&rsquo;s how deep we meditate. The depth of meditation is different, Charan Singh and many of the Masters they say meditate for two hours minimum and the best time is around three o&rsquo;clock now, what time is it there, half past five? Good time to meditate says now is a good time to meditate when all the cosmic vibrations are pouring in because all the Masters themselves are meditating so but look how much vibrations have been pouring into the room already, you see. Now this is Satsanga you see, this is communion with them because you are calling their consciousness into your life at this period of the day when they are at their peak this is their peak moment. In other words the transmitter is really generating because the earth is already in position now with the sun to really send vibrations out. Now to sit in a Satsanga or what you call a fellowship in truth, this association and of listening and talking of the Masters&rsquo; consciousness, pull in on our own consciousness and lift us but we stay with that vibration. Now they say at least two hours of meditation but two hours of wandering in the meditation is no good, it would be better if you had ten minutes of no wandering in meditation than to  have the two hours wandering away in the meditation. Now if you can have two hours of no wandering in the mind in meditation that will be still better so the idea is behind the meditation is not to wander. Now not WONDER, WANDER, the one word could be very misleading because wondering WONDER is the key to real meditation. You see if you take away the power of wonder, to question, then you&rsquo;re not going to meditate. Now and if you retain the power of WANDER that is wandering, drifting all over the world with your consciousness, that is no good to the meditation either. The idea is to come into consciousness and to watch, to feel, to identify. Aim for the first thing which I think is the thing most of us don&rsquo;t realize we should aim at, aim for the internal peace, aim for the internal tranquility, the internal serenity that this mechanism under any condition retain its tranquillity. In other words don&rsquo;t let the body generate too much adrenaline, don&rsquo;t adrenalize, try to get this phosphorus going in us, phosphorize our cells you know, light up so we have this joy going in us, this bliss going in us. 1:40 You know it&rsquo;s a hard thing to say to somebody &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling bliss&rdquo; and they are feeling pain. Audience: Back to bliss again, that&rsquo;s the one I had a hurdle trying to get over. Adano: But the hurdle is wonderful. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: That&rsquo;s like &ldquo;which witch went which witch way?&rdquo; Now here is another experience, in this particular time of the year in India you have what is called Diwali, the festival of the lights, in our environment we got All Souls Day, it&rsquo;s the same thing. On All Souls Day don&rsquo;t the church light up a candle&hellip; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well were do you think they got all these ideas from and All Souls Day follows Halloween, Halloween is the witch stopper &ldquo;which witch went after which witch?&rdquo; And Diwali is the conquest over the darkness so where do we get the ideas that we&rsquo;re carrying on today that comes down all through time and the idea of the light passing on down. It is this was the very central idea where it came from, passing of the light on from in here to the next person through meditation, the overcoming of the five senses, which is the Halloween in us, the hallucination in us, that&rsquo;s the overcoming of that five senses so that the inner consciousness can work. See we are all going back to these same basic principles but over the centuries it became now tradition or custom, it became sort of a holiday but the real principles are still there. We don&rsquo;t imitate or retain certain traditions or customs unless they did not at one time had an origin in truth, see there is always that particular period where the truth was actually experienced. Now among the North American Indians they have the same principle, Cherokees will chant and light the flame from this grotto in Tahlequah and once the flame is comes up with their ritual then the first man goes and lights his lamp then everyone comes and lights from his and they always keep that flame going. Audience: It&rsquo;s really a symbolic gesture of a real truth. Adano: It all comes back of trying to find a light inside of ourselves. Now you go in the Kahunas on the island and you&rsquo;ve got the same thing too. Now they were totally removed from all these things and if you go back in the Egyptian writings you&rsquo;ll see they had that too, used to carry the light from one house to the other and even the Hebrew people copied it. Today on a Friday night they got their lights you see from time immemorial Man has always been&hellip; in other words from the day the Greek Prometheus discovered that two stones produced fire, everybody lit up, and when they said the Gods punished him for that by letting the vulture eat his liver out, that&rsquo;s also a mythological principle. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well this is a funny thing now that you mention it when I was a young boy in my country I heard a joke and I thought this was a typical original joke originated in my country, nobody else would have this. Years after traveling around I heard this joke is so many different parts of the world I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how it got around. Who started the joke in the first place? I heard this thing being told to me and I though, &ldquo;this can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; A joke that I heard when I was a kid, I went to Canada and heard the same joke, I travel across the United States and hear people say the same joke and I figure to myself, &ldquo;Where did it start?&rdquo; It reminds me of that thing &ldquo;Kilroy was here.&rdquo; Funny, some things are just carried on and on and you don&rsquo;t know how it comes to be carried on and this is like meditation, we hear it so much mentioned that when we do come to it itself, into the actual involvement with it, it&rsquo;s not what we were expecting. Audience: Well the books are so different it seems to me like they emphasize different points and you wonder really what your object is by the time you read several books on it. Adano: Well here is a good example of Masters writing on meditation, Master Yogananda&rsquo;s writing on meditation and here is what he states which will give you an idea what you are trying to attempt in meditation. &ldquo;Most people would want to meditate if they understood how to do it. The purpose of meditation is to know God, to connect the little joy the Soul with the vast joy of the Spirit. Meditation is not the same as concentration, concentration consists of freeing the attention from objects of distraction and focusing it on one thing at a time. Meditation is that special form of concentration in which the attention has been liberated from restlessness and is focused on God, the noumena. A man may concentrate on the thought of Divinity or on money either but he may not meditate on money or any other material thing. Meditation is only focused on the thought of God and its holy prophets, communion of the Saints.&rdquo; Remember I said before in meditation this is what you&rsquo;re really establishing, a communication with the Saints. &ldquo;Meditation consists of certain physical, psychological, and metaphysical processes by which the static or restlessness may be removed from a man&rsquo;s mental radio which may then be tuned in with the infinite. All forms of meditation involve the one who meditates, the process of meditation, and the object of his meditation. The aim is to attain a consciousness of spirit by calm, continuous, one pointed attention until the Soul is merged in everlasting bliss. The meditator should therefore know a definite method of meditation and should choose a definite spiritual thought or experience on which to meditate. This book offers certain definite metaphysical methods of meditation for the student who has already struggled through the mob of rowdy thoughts and has entered the portals of silence. In the temple of silence, I will greet Thee, I will love Thee on the altar of peace.&rdquo; What is he going to greet? Who is he going to greet? The inner light. &ldquo;No more do I pray with blissful words but only with yawns.&rdquo; Do you remember that chant? If you listen to the chant, what he is doing in meditation you will see what meditation really is. The chants themselves tell you what he&rsquo;s supposed to be doing, sitting at the lotus feet of thinking of your Guru, making communion with a holy being. &ldquo;The meditation given are of three types: those that are addressed to God or affirmations about God and those are spoken to individual consciousness. We can select either one to meet the need, audibly or mentally repeat the words slowly and purposefully until you become absorbed in the meaning.&rdquo; Well what he&rsquo;s trying to point out that when you come to meditate there is no other object in your consciousness but the object of God and that&rsquo;s why I say when Jesus said &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind and all your Soul, strength&rdquo; this is the object of meditation but it is love, to fill this consciousness with love because the whole ocean of love is passing around us but we can&rsquo;t to connect to it and love brings joy. Now we know the tears of pain that can come from love and we know the tears of joy that can come from love, but the tears of joy are so seldom in relation to the tears of pain that come from love. 1:50 We can have more pain and tears from pain than from joy because everything we turn to leads us to pain, very little will lead us to joy until we connect inside and recognize that there is a joy, there is a fountain of joy that we connect with and then those tears are natural tears. It&rsquo;s is the funny thing when it comes, without even trying you just well-up in the deepest meditation and you&rsquo;re gone and tears just seem to flow out and you don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re crying. Now it has been said by psychiatrists that prayer or tears coming out of the eyes are one of the means in which the brain rids itself of unwanted ideas. That&rsquo;s an unusual statement, it&rsquo;s a way the brain can rid itself of unwanted ideas after a good hearty cry. In many of my experiences in helping people through their problems, I always try to reach the point where they can cry that I know a healing has occurred because without the tear coming out, the pent-up emotion is so strong in them, there is no release, there is no break but the moment they can break and this condition comes out, there is release, there is a tremendous release of inner tension, it breaks all the forces and this is a natural thing you see. The doctors now are realizing that it is one way we can throw off or rid ourselves from these unwanted ideas, that there is a mental release coming on from inside you see. Now another thing they point out is the man that does not cry or the woman that does not cry is mentally ill. You see if you cannot cry, it&rsquo;s like you cannot laugh, you see this is something wrong, there is something stricture in some part of your mechanism that is preventing that from happening to you and all great men or all spiritual men have cried and have laughed. You see even you look at the pictures of all the great Saints, you always see the tears on their eyes and you want to know how is a holy man having tears but his tears is not tears of sorrow or tears of pain, these are the tears of joy that well up from within him seeing the evolution of the race coming up or maturing after laying his life down or giving what he could give to them but this is not involved in personality, you see this is involved with the impersonalness of the thing because he is so wrapped up in the impersonal nature of God in the whole of humanity that he&rsquo;s crying you see, he&rsquo;s not crying from berevement, he&rsquo;s crying from the happiness that the humanity is lifting themselves up one step higher now, they are pulled themselves up. Audience: That&rsquo;s what they say, why men can&rsquo;t understand women, when she&rsquo;s happy she cries, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Adano: But it is and now the doctors are realizing that this is a very important function. Audience: Well but the other kind of tears (inaudible). Adano: Well they tell us if you don&rsquo;t cry well it could be from pain or something, if you don&rsquo;t cry something is wrong mentally somewhere and there&rsquo;s stricture somewhere because it is natural for the brain to release. You see they found this only from experimental in dream now, that people cry when they dream, unknowing to themselves, and this was what bring release too from inside. Audience: Well you know what I&rsquo;ve heard is that coughing is inner crying. You cry from a cold? And the more I watch that, the more I believe it, don&rsquo;t you? Adano: Yes I&rsquo;ve seen it and it is a form of crying. Audience: It&rsquo;s an inner&hellip; Adano: Inner crying, it&rsquo;s a release, it is this mechanism that we really began to learn from. You know one time, I have a friend, he&rsquo;s a colored boy, I met him years ago, he&rsquo;s not educated, he didn&rsquo;t pretend to be educated and we became friendly under odd circumstance, he worked in a railroad yard and I had this restaurant right across, I used to deliver coffee. So one day he said to me, &ldquo;I learn from people and I&rsquo;d like to talk to you,&rdquo; just like that, he said, &ldquo;You must know something otherwise you couldn&rsquo;t own a restaurant.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much, all I know is how to buy and sell.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s pretty good, I will learn how to buy and sell from you. What do you buy and what do you sell?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I buy bread and all these different things.&rdquo; We start talking, he says &ldquo;You make a profit on all this?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the only way you can operate.&rdquo; Well the strange thing, every day I see him talking to different people and I&rsquo;ll get him in a conversation at the end when he comes around and from the various people he met and spoke to, he learned exactly what they were doing because he had an outright way of asking questions that will bring up the conversation that the other people were involved with, what they did for a living or what made them what they are and he would ask questions pertaining to this thing and he would have a whole list of information from so many different people that I said to him, &ldquo;What are you going to do with it now after you got it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well I may use it someday.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s good&rdquo; but he was learning from people, he figured if a man did a certain thing a certain way and was continually doing it, this was a belief, continually doing it and was happy at it, there must be something to it. So he would like to find out from that person how he did it or why he did it and by this exposure in conversation he begin to see that person. Now what I observed eventually of this boy, he became a very astute student of life without even going to school or studying any book of psychology he could size up people so fast from the various people&rsquo;s occupation and their reactions who was successful or was not, he was able to spot successful people just like that and he would point out &ldquo;See that man over there, I don&rsquo;t know him but I can bet you he doesn&rsquo;t know how to make a success of his business&rdquo; and he could actually point out people who, by this observation the way they walk and talk (inaudible) and this was an interesting way of learning. They say well some people learn about life that are important to life itself in a different way. Audience: Well this brings to mind a story I heard about primitive people that didn&rsquo;t have contact with outside people with their religions and so forth, but in their normal course of living developed the idea of meditation and certain ways of life and it must be that it springs from (inaudible) because there&rsquo;s a truth within if they ever allow it to come out. Adano: Well I have an interesting thing, there were two brothers that lived in South America when the missionaries came there and one had his Indian name Running Bear there and the other one had his Christian name, he was baptized, his name was John. So every day Running Bear would be sitting down and he would be thinking, happy, nothing on his mind, he would sing and whistle	(inaudible) and there was an engineer guy who was trying to find oil where I was born you know, he would always see John and John was always sad and he&rsquo;s a Christian. 2:00 He says &ldquo;John why are you so sad, so glum like the world is on your back?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confused boss, my brother he not baptized, not Christian, yet he happy man. Me I&rsquo;m supposed to be that modern, very hip kid, I&rsquo;m baptized, can&rsquo;t find happiness, very discontented.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Why are you discontented?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well look church says when I die, I have eternal life. I don&rsquo;t see that, my tradition, my people believe different but I leave that tradition to join church.&rdquo; So the engineer guy says, &ldquo;Explain to me what is your tradition.&rdquo; He says Well if somebody and me get in a fight and I beat him and I kill if, I eat him, eat my enemy so I get strong. Now he live in me, he get everlasting life. Now when I die maggots eat me, maggots get everlasting life, they get something to eat but this Christian doctrine priests say this cannot be, I cannot eat my enemy, and when I die I got to be buried away from the maggots. Very very bad because I cheat the maggots and I&rsquo;ve been cheated eating the guy I didn&rsquo;t give him everlasting life.&rdquo; You see what one concept in one man&rsquo;s mind can do? He&rsquo;s been trained this way you see and his brother is happy. Now here he&rsquo;s being taught a whole new concept, which is important, the concept that or the happiness of the individual (gap in tape)&hellip; a group or individual you&rsquo;re trying to feel. Now we cannot think in meditation, eventually we find out that thinking in meditation does not help us no more, we are constantly going to try to generate ideas or think ideas in meditation, sooner or later they interfere with the feeling. Now but when you begin to feel or sense that you can feel all over your whole mechanism in meditation, then automatically the naturalness, the internal peace, the internal love, begins to flow. It&rsquo;s through this feeling that the consciousness begins to rise and that&rsquo;s why it begins to expand and you become aware of levels of consciousness, you could not begin to think levels of consciousness, you can only feel levels of consciousness, and by feeling levels of consciousness you perceive these levels and they are always going to be in the form of a picture, mental image. Now it is true the mental images that are left in the brainwaves that we begin to perceive, now the Masters are saying that we watch here in this point between the eyebrows and this level of light then the images start moving in, we are like a receiver now and we begin to pick up. Now the first thing we are trying to impress on the mind is that we should always think of the realized individuals, those who have completely realized themselves because their vibrations, their electrical vibrations that are manifesting on the inner plane can lift us up and hold us at the higher plane of existence. Audience: Well do you contact those by having them in mind, is that the idea or is there only a sort of an acceptance or an invitation within consciousness? Adano: No no no see you turn on a TV set and you pick up a program and you associate and identify with the program. Now but that doesn&rsquo;t say you can control the program. Audience: The only thing you can do to control it is turn it off. Adano: Right but not the program itself, you can only control the unit that is handling the program. Now the Masters are saying this is identically true with us but we have one advantage, the advantage is that we can go one step further than our actual TV set, we can go into verification by personal experience. We can meditate until this consciousness draws that person or being into manifestation and this is true, we have to meditate until we feel their presence, you have to meditate until you can see them with your eyes wide open and you can meditate until they talk to you and eventually you must meditate until they would eat some food that you offer to them. Audience: That&rsquo;s taking it a little too far. Adano: No that is taking it to the point of verification, see Master if you read &ldquo;The Master Said,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a book that he wrote called &ldquo;The Master Said,&rdquo; in that book there are instances where one of the disciple says &ldquo;Master you are fortunate, all the Saints come and talk to you&rdquo; and they couldn&rsquo;t see it you know. You know every time you go by the garden you hear the Master talking to two or three people in the garden but he couldn&rsquo;t see who it was, he says &ldquo;Master is talking to the Saints behind there.&rdquo; And the Master says, &ldquo;They come here every day so one day would make no difference, they&rsquo;re here all the time.&rdquo; You see it&rsquo;s like Lahiri Mahasaya and Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya summoned Babaji out of the cosmoss to manifest to him. Now Babaji did not want the disciple&rsquo;s word to fail so he remained for them to see him that he was tangible, he was living, he was in the form, and that this is true and he permitted them to cook some food and he ate with them. There was a Saint, a Catholic Saint, it&rsquo;s on record, who used to see Jesus and he was not accepted at a Saint in the Catholic Church, they thought something was wrong with him and he was having hallucinations and working with the devil and a local priest, no the local bishop, came to exorcise the so called Jesus and when he walked in the room to see the brother where the brother was praying, he saw Jesus in the place of the brother. He took off so fast he never bothered the brother no more, he just permitted him carry on he daily meditations. He was convinced then that the Lord Jesus was a living being. Now they have had many such instances where the Masters have all interceded for their disciples in every religion because it&rsquo;s one science, one truth that we go inside, that&rsquo;s why meditation is such an important thing to us you see that we get the experience of going inside. Now let&rsquo;s meditate, those vibrations are coming all the way from India (laughter) and we&rsquo;re not enjoying them. (gap in tape) another thing too, when you&rsquo;re fortunate to have a letter from a Holy Master, his signature, you should always keep it on your person because vibration is feeding to you see and you can help yourself in your meditation by putting the signature on your third eye. There&rsquo;s lots to this spiritual growth you know, many things that Masters do because the moment they handle something, they&rsquo;re in that total consciousness (inaudible) they cannot rub it out so they touch everything that&rsquo;s (inaudible) you see, and keep it on your person it&rsquo;s a very powerful magnet, it&rsquo;s like a switch you see, especially the signature itself, not what they typed, somebody has typed that, but where they put their signature by themselves, you should always keep it because he had to handle the paper you see, the vibrations are passing right into it. Now they touch food when they give their blessing and if you have (gap in tape). It&rsquo;s blue every painting or any experience of any recording of this experience, it&rsquo;s always seen in blue, don&rsquo;t they paint Krishna in blue? They paint Jesus in a blue light, the same thing the Cherokee Indians, the Navajo Indians, they all say they see the great (inaudible) in blue, Christ, the same thing, it&rsquo;s all in blue. Master says it&rsquo;s a Christ consciousness, the spiritual eye has three colors, gold which is the Holy Spirit or Cosmic Vibration, then there is blue see you have it outside of you, at dawn you have the golden ring which covers the entire horizon or which hits between the earth and the sun rays that&rsquo;s your golden ring you see, then you have the entire blue (inaudible) which is the Christ consciousness, that is the intelligence present in vibratory creation, then within this blue is a white silver star but it&rsquo;s upside down and looks like a dove descending. It always seems like it is coming down to you, the descent of divinity, that&rsquo;s what they say &ldquo;avatar,&rdquo; the descent of divinity into Man, see it&rsquo;s that descent.</p>
<h2 id="1968-november-3---smu-lecture-at-paulines">1968 November 3 - SMU Lecture at Pauline&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>Adano68_11_03SMULecturePaulinesQ1RRNW6 - Audience: Dallas Satsang at Pauline Hardaways, we are going to listen to Adano Ley, our beloved Guru, speak  extemporaneous on diverse and fascinating spiritual subjects. Adano: Well you see the thing is meditation that we are trying to establish in ourselves as daily practice is a form of spiritual immunization against the environmental pressures so that we can live in this world, operate and perform our daily occupational functions without being swamped by the tension generated from the occupation and the association with people and meditation, through the daily practice of it, gradually immunizes you against this stress. You find yourself coping more and more with the occupational conditions with less and less anxiety, less and less psychological stresses and also your sense of direction and decision goes with much more authority from the confidence built up from the meditation. You begin to experience this even in studying or anything you will notice that before you take up any section of study, a brief period of meditation reinforces you, it gives you a sort of an inner clarity to analyze and memorize whatever subject you are studying. See meditation is not a one-sided thing, it&rsquo;s both internal and external, it&rsquo;s involved with establishing an inner identify, an inner strength, an inner sense of focus, and at the same time it&rsquo;s establishing outwardly an ability to ward off the pressures that the mechanism under normal conditions would not be able to ward off. Certain pressures from the environment can be very aggravating, very frustrating, very detrimental to your whole psychic makeup, to your whole mental makeup, to your own physical makeup. Now if you have nothing to fall back on biologically or psychologically to reinforce your own constructive nature, your own regenerative nature then you will have to rely on some tranquilizer or some drug to stave it off, to stave off this pressure, this anxiety, otherwise your body builds up so much pressure that sooner or later you develop into a nervous wreck. Now since prevention is better than cure, you find that by the meditative process, you&rsquo;re actually setting up a prevention method of stabilizing and staving off this psychological and environmental pressure that accumulates from association and occupation. You begin to see now that there is strength, in other words you are applying instead of just giving lip-service to think / act, you&rsquo;re now applying thinking and acting daily, in other words you are gonna think first then you follow-up with the acting, you see? You&rsquo;re acting each part now, not just only thinking and wishing for it to happen, but you are thinking, but then you&rsquo;re following-up with the thinking the action that goes with the thinking. Audience: In doing various activities, should you keep the attention at the eyebrow center, is that decreasing your capacity to do a job to its fullest? Adano: No no no no, it would not&hellip; where your full attention is required, and your vision is where your attention is all the time, see wherever you centralize your vision, that is the greatest portion of your object of concentration of vision when your whole mind is there at that moment, but gradual immersing yourself at the point between the eyes as a recharging process, as a revitalizing process to cope with what you&rsquo;re doing objectively, this is the right attitude. Audience: In other words like right now you can still be aware of your attention being at the eyebrow center. Adano: Yes, it is feeling it, it is not so much thinking as learning to feel your consciousness there. You see because the gland itself is a triggering agent, it&rsquo;s like a switch, it switches the current downwards that is required to be used and as you feel it more in yourself, as you feel yourself identified at the point between the eyebrows, more and more the vital life power flows down to sustain and maintain your consciousness during the period of activity. Now if you can also feel your consciousness in the spinal column during study, during activity, during occupational work, then more and more the energy will permeate the mechanism and keep the mechanism in a state of relaxation. Then there would be very little tension or anxiety building up in the body, see you can learn to feel in the spine and feeling is the key. See the more you feel, the more this energy will flow, this is the one thing we are learning to realize is how to feel. You want to learn how not to have a wandering mind so that you can meditate because if you have a wandering mind and I&rsquo;m trying to meditate, you&rsquo;re playing see-saw with your meditation, you understand? So the meditation becomes a difficult tug-of-war between you and your five senses all the time, between you and the environment, but training yourself to prepare the mind so it don&rsquo;t wander, it doesn&rsquo;t drift, as a preliminary warm-up to meditation, this is what you want to acquire. Audience: During the meditation should you stick to just one mantra like So-Hong through the entire meditation or should you switch to a&hellip; Adano: No, you can switch as the urge causes you to switch, you can switch though I&rsquo;ll tell you that So-Hong by itself if done with the preliminary preparation of concentrating and not wandering, the meditation becomes easier to do. So-Hong primarily is a preparation to prevent your mind from wandering. Audience: You mean after you do that technique then you don&rsquo;t do any mantras, you&rsquo;re broadcasting awhile and you let it comes back. Adano: Right, what you&rsquo;re broadcasting now after you&rsquo;ve done the technique of programming the mind not to wander, in So-Hong you&rsquo;re programming it, then you going to generate love and the feeling of love flowing in and out. 0:10 Now you&rsquo;re gonna stop programming, you&rsquo;re gonna stop thinking, you understand, and work on feeling. See the So-Hong or the mantra is primarily to prevent the mind from wandering, it&rsquo;s an aid in thinking, it&rsquo;s an aid in concentrating, but it&rsquo;s not an aid in bringing forth love, love is a feeling, you see it&rsquo;s a prerequisite, it&rsquo;s a preparation for calming the mind or letting the mind remain calm and receptive so you can generate this love or be receptive to this love that is coming in. Audience: Well so it&rsquo;s like each of these mantras, that has a different specific thing to do to? That&rsquo;s just calling out names of God, but again as a process to calm the mind. Adano: The name, because it&rsquo;s Sanskrit, has certain vibratory responses which trigger off certain wavelengths or vibrations within our make-up that keep our consciousness on a high level of attunement, but the names themselves does not generate the love that we have to generate as a feeling. Sooner or later we&rsquo;re forced then to generate the love as a feeling in order to be receptive to a love coming back as a feeling. See the name we can keep repeating it over and over, but that doesn&rsquo;t say the vibration of that spiritual perfume of God&rsquo;s love gonna pass through this room, we ourselves gotta generate this love so that this love will flow back to us from that realm. Remember if the Masters are using a spiritual force to make Themselves available to us from another level of existence, this force would have to be some form of energy and would be some tangible form of matter, but that matter might not be the gross matter that we perceive it, it may be a highly refined form of matter, nevertheless it is in a Divine state because we cannot make it. It&rsquo;s Divinity only indicates its ability to be in existence independent of our sensory make-up and its ability exist because it was brought into effect by consciousness, no amount of mechanical gymnastics is going to produce it, you understand? We cannot produce an atom by mechanical gymnastics, this was definitely the result of consciousness, you see? So we are dealing with pure consciousness which is the divinity of that atom. Now what we are trying to realize is again, though we use So-Hong and though we generate love as feeling out of our mechanism which is matter and this love moves out as a vibration which is pure energy and which can be perceived as an odor which again is consciousness, we see then in return for this generative principle we receive that same thing coming back to us in a much more subtle way. We start getting back love coming to us in the heightened feeling of goose pimple sensation, this electrical charge, this electromagnetizing of the cells, it comes back to us again in the form of the odor or the incense, the perfume, and then it comes back to us again in the presence of a tremendous density in the room, a heaviness, a thickness, as if there is a closing in. You ever feel like the whole room is closing in on you, this is again the presence of the Divinity coming back to you as to indicate that all things are now in a high state of acceleration and that you are IT now, you are involved in the IT-ness of this thing and if you are afraid, there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of because this is what you eventually would be if the physical frame cease to function as a breathing mechanism, you would see this IT-ness, this total force as yourself and you would see the responsibility of this force holding you up as yourself. Then you realize that there is nothing here to be afraid in God, that this is strictly pure love, but a love that is so impersonal that it demands respect. It&rsquo;s not awesome, it&rsquo;s no gruesome, but it&rsquo;s so magnified that the limited brain cells, the limited five sense comprehension could not envelope it or put a ring around it and cap it, you know, or contain it. The infinity of this we cannot seem to contain with our five senses, this would be the big tug-of-war, how can we contain infinity with the five senses? The brain would seem at loss to do this, to contain the immensity and the infinity of the Divine Pure Energy and consciousness within the limited five senses, yet the limited five senses strives or craves to contain the immensity. We do this with our eyes when we look at the ocean but we cannot contain the ocean in our brain, you see? It&rsquo;s kind of preposterous to put all these things in one little box of a brain and say we contain it, but look how many things we put in there and we try to contain and it really is not containing, we&rsquo;re only feeling an identity, we&rsquo;re not becoming one with the identity. That&rsquo;s why in a meditation you are trying now to feel more than to think, it&rsquo;s by the feeling and the flow of the feeling that links you with the life and the life now begins to become infinite that it reaches out and experience in every level. Audience: This woman last week she said, &ldquo;get down on your knees, cry, through travail God will come to you through a certain of decision of the heart.&rdquo; Sri Ramakrishna speaks of the same thing, how many people we&rsquo;ve forgot, I understand what they mean when they say we&rsquo;re weakened because of our separation, because of our delusive feeling of separation, but at the same time when you&rsquo;re feeling love in the meditation, that&rsquo;s not a reason to cry. Adano: You see we cry in strange ways and in ways unknown to ourselves we are crying. Crying does not necessarily mean that the eyes have to give up water you know. Most of us think that because some liquid fell out of the pair of eyes we are crying, you can have a stye in your eye and still not crying you see. Now the aching, the yearning, the sense of being complete are the highest forms of crying. The insufficiency of the physical frame to contain the immensity of its nature, the inability of the five senses to put a ring around the total universe in which it perceives and carry it within as sort of capsule, this is the aching part, this is the crying, this is the depression, this is the moments of anxiety so intense that you wonder why you are trapped in such a small, shallow mechanism trying to contain such a vast universe. Now this is the crying, now this can get so pronounced that it will force liquid out of the eyes in the form of tears. Now, then all of sudden there will be a welling up, a filling up within your nature that the immensity is so great that it permeates you and you are trying to burst at your seams now to hold it, you&rsquo;re bursting at the seams now, you see? You can&rsquo;t hold on no more, you put a ring around it, but you&rsquo;re bursting at the seams to hold it now. Now this is not anxiety, this is too much to hold onto, it&rsquo;s too good to keep to yourself, you gotta give it away or you gotta share it with somebody, it&rsquo;s gotta overflow and that brings tears too because where do I share this, this overwhelming bursting sensation, this overwhelming desire to spill over, you see? 0:20 One was to contain and that has a feeling of anxiety and pain and a tear condition and here&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s just bursting to flow out, just craving to explode, and this is producing a feeling of tear in you, you can&rsquo;t hold back your eyes from being watering, you cannot prevent your eyes from watering even if you want to explode. This is not a tear of sorrow now, this is tears of joy but this is a watering of the mechanism from over filling of the thing, you&rsquo;re too over filled with the thing, so there&rsquo;s no way to contain it. Before you were trying to contain it and therefore was the aching or the crying you see and now you&rsquo;re not aching, you&rsquo;re not crying, you&rsquo;re bursting with thing like a pregnant woman ready to explode, either way you see, and therefore it&rsquo;s bringing you now another type of tear, it&rsquo;s a tear or a release of wanting to share, so badly you want to share, you don&rsquo;t know where to share it with, who to share it with, you just bursting to share you see, and this is bringing out feeling of crying too. See crying is not necessarily to want, to have, it also want to share, it&rsquo;s both you see. Wanting to share is crying, wanting not to be left out is crying, you see, wanting to contain is crying, these are all forms of crying, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily say that tears would flow out of the eyes to emphasize the crying, it is a condition that is going on in us, we are realizing that these are all forms of crying and we&rsquo;re just bursting with it, you see. Now you can laugh and keep on laughing and get on a laughing jag and start crying, you ever had that happen to you? You just keep on laughing, you can&rsquo;t stop laughing, good, same thing. This is an interesting observation of the behavior nature, this what you&rsquo;re trying to observe because it is within these functions you are discovering the real-ness of your nature, you&rsquo;re discovering who you really are, you&rsquo;re not discovering a super-man-ness, you&rsquo;re discovering the human-ness of your make-up. See Divinity is not what most people think, you read the letter of Master Charan Singh that what is greater than the human body and the human qualities that give this opportunity to experience Divinity in it, but the Divinity in it is already locked up as what you call the highest form of human-ness within a human body and the highest form of human-ness in a human body would be the tenderness of his emotions, the deep tender feelings of his emotions, the deep sensitivities of his emotions, the refined qualities of how it is aching to expand or burst and how it&rsquo;s aching to contain, you see. This is what you&rsquo;re discovering about the human part of you, that all is locked up and all is not just emotion, but all is also devotion because out of this emotion that is aching to give and aching to contain, comes the devotion. It comes back inwards, it comes as a re-sustaining force, it comes as revitalizing principle because then you realize that you&rsquo;re meditating primarily to identify with the ultra-humanness or the hyper-humanness of your human make-up, you see. You call your hyper or ultra humanness your Divinity, now Divinity in the mind of the average person seems to be something remote and far beyond, you see this is the common concept, &ldquo;out of my reach, therefore I can&rsquo;t do anything about it,&rdquo; but it isn&rsquo;t true. The Masters have already said that God is you at the most closest point within you and the most closest point within you is the ultra-tenderness of you. You can&rsquo;t be any closer than that, how close can you get to the real tenderness of yourself? What can be so precisely measured in tenderness would be the next suspended breath because the next suspended breath would be ultra-tender, observe it. Everything is suspended in the next breath and it is in that ultra-moment, that hyper-moment of suspension, is the highest feeling of tenderness possible because it is like trying to fit the thread into the eye of the needle, it is every second, every split second of watching and trying to connect and you pay no attention to your physical frame how much it is suspended for this degree of tenderness in your nature, you want this tenderness to come up and you can feel it by the touch. Now the interesting part is when you meditate and you feel yourself bursting and then all you want, you touch somebody and there is so much tenderness flows out of you, you just don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s coming from, why is it going, and you&rsquo;re just bursting all over, you&rsquo;re like putty, you see, your whole nature becomes like putty. Audience: Before we go get the other people, one quick question. When you&rsquo;re doing the mantras in your meditation, can you listen at the same time to the audible life stream? Adano: Yeah, yeah you can do it. Audience: One more quick question, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me and it&rsquo;s not upsetting to me but I&rsquo;ve always been wondering about and I&rsquo;ve meant to ask you about during the summer, what exactly happens when we slip into what is called unconsciousness? Where does the consciousness go? Adano: Where does it go? Down in the spinal column below the brain, you see from here down into the lower portion of the spine, right in the spine, you see here it stays up here, this is the cranium up to the nasal tract, you understand? And you&rsquo;re holding on, holding on, holding on, now suddenly you can&rsquo;t seem to hold on no more, then it slips down right down in here, into the throat center. Now that&rsquo;s where you (Adano makes snoring sound). Audience: Why does it slip down? Adano: Because you cannot hold it, too much for you to hold. Now that where the technique and this is where the meditation comes in, if you find you&rsquo;re drifting down you can start programming the mind not to drift down or you can start So-Hong or watching the breath, this will pull it back, or you can start generating the sensation of pain. See pain is a very important thing, it will prevent consciousness from slipping down, I had to prove it for myself, that it prevents consciousness from slipping down, it stays here all the time. Why? Because it has to register on the pituitary and it has to register on the medulla and it has to register on the pineal and these are areas that are highly sensitive. Now if you bite and register some kind of pain reaction, the eyes begin to dilate, bite your finger and see. Don&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s a pressure on the eyes? And you&rsquo;re forced to keep your eyes open more, right? Doesn&rsquo;t the eyes seem to want to push out yourself or force it the way out through the opening of the ball that it wants to push out, it wants to get out of it because it is a sensation of pain that maintains the objective state, it maintains this condition of staying awake. 0:30 Now to stay awake is to gaze straight ahead of yourself and don&rsquo;t wink, but you cannot do that without some incentive and (inaudible) a technique by biting, this helps you to stay alert. The sensation of pain, though it may seem crude, but it is the most practical way of staying alert / awake. Now you drive at night and get woozy before you get to some spot where you can stop and rest, put your finger in your mouth and drive, you will stay alert. Audience: (inaudible). Adano: Well this is it, you see the thing you have to learn both, you&rsquo;re learning to meditate with eyes open and eyes closed. Now the actual way of the eyes are half open / half closed so you are like this, so there is a little strain for you to keep it open which prevents, which acts like a brake now, and prevents you from going in, but if you&rsquo;re observing it you&rsquo;ll notice the breath comes into play and sometimes it&rsquo;s by observing how deep you breathe you will discover that sometimes you&rsquo;re not really breathing deep enough to stay awake, you see you&rsquo;re not getting enough oxygen to stay alert. Audience: In the breathless state though&hellip; Adano: That&rsquo;s an entirely different thing, see in the breathless state, the mechanism has suspended itself from the constant intake and exhalation and has stored up enough oxygen to stay in a suspended state. So occasionally you (Adano takes a deep breath) take a deep breath, but then you&rsquo;re not forcing yourself to hold it, it seems to suspend itself again. See but that is without urge, without craving for breath, before you know it you&rsquo;re forcing it, but without urging it you&rsquo;re observing it coming and how long it comes in and how long it stays out, this is how much more oxygenation is occurring in you, you see. This is why you&rsquo;re not trying to alter the flow of breathing, you&rsquo;re trying to observe the flow of breathing. (Gap in tape). We were talking about meditation you know, what goes on in meditation, the practice of meditation what it leads to. See meditation is a definite way or process of calming the mind and it prepares you to realize your inner self. See it&rsquo;s not so easy to calm the mind because too many outward distractions that occur all the time that make your mind wander. See normally a person does not stay in a state of concentration or calm state of mind therefore they normally would drift, they would start thinking of something that would cause your mind from one thought to another. Now usually if the person thinks of something concerning the past, automatically a certain amount of frustration begins to occur in them, we don&rsquo;t know why but it&rsquo;s something that they aren&rsquo;t able to get back to because it&rsquo;s in the past you see. Now if they begin to think of something concerning tomorrow or the future then before you know it, let&rsquo;s say the next half an hour, the mind starts to generate some form of anxiety, you start to worry, you wonder what they&rsquo;re going to say, what they&rsquo;re gonna do, suppose you&rsquo;re late for school, you start worrying. You haven&rsquo;t arrived yet, you haven&rsquo;t confronted the fact that you&rsquo;re late so this anxiety, this frustration coming up you see, so you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. Before you know it your nerves start to be tense and you get tired, extremely irritable and begin to worry. Well in the meantime if were to think where you are right now, your present state, and not to think of tomorrow or yesterday, the mind would stand still. The mere fact that you are right now where you are, you find that you begin to feel peace. You see the question is why if you&rsquo;re thinking in the present, you would feel peace and if you&rsquo;re thinking in the past you don&rsquo;t feel it, you&rsquo;re thinking in the future you don&rsquo;t feel it, why should you think in the present then suddenly you feel peace? Because you live in the present all the time, you don&rsquo;t live in the past, you don&rsquo;t live in the future, it&rsquo;s only the mind that moves back and forth, but actually as a person living, it&rsquo;s in the present, but you may not be aware of it until it&rsquo;s pointed out to you that you&rsquo;re living in the present, then right away you begin to slow down. Now once you start slowing down then the tension or any anxiety or frustration starts to wear off. It is in the present that we&rsquo;re concerning constantly all the time how to utilize the creative nature of the mind in the present, how to direct it. When you study or try to memorize anything, you&rsquo;re caught again within having to do it right away and having to have it ready for tomorrow and then you&rsquo;re worry about &ldquo;would I know it by then tomorrow, would I retain it when I get to use it tomorrow?&rdquo; All of this is going on right in the present and you haven&rsquo;t begun to memorize the object yet or the subject yet, you&rsquo;ve started building walls all around before you&rsquo;ve even begun to memorize the thing, &ldquo;would I get enough time, do I have to catch the movie&hellip;&rdquo; So many things we start building up in the mind, we starting thinking of so many different things before we begin to do the one very important thing right now in the present. Then you realize that &ldquo;wait a minute, I don&rsquo;t have to be in a hurry, I will know it by tomorrow, I will memorize it right now.&rdquo; So you stop right there, dead in your tracks, and you have exerted your willpower, you will memorize it right now you say to yourself, you will memorize it right now. The moment you say that you have made the first attempt to meditate in a conscious way by preparing yourself, by bringing you will into control and direction. So you sit down and you try to memorize, well if you&rsquo;re trying to memorize by forcing the brain to memorize just because you have to memorize and know the information before morning, this is going about it the very hard way and you burn up more energy trying to memorize something that could be memorized very simply if you learned the technique of memorizing. 0:40 Now meditation is how to calm this mind so that when you put an idea inside, it will stay inside and when you&rsquo;re ready to apply this mind, this idea would be present there to work right away. Most of us do it unconsciously, some of us are very good memory only because we have done this so many times unknowingly to ourselves and it has stayed with us, but to those who don&rsquo;t know and those who cannot, then this is a process in which they cannot (inaudible) to direct themselves. Now before you start to do anything you always let the mind calm itself, you always think of the present, now this is very important because it has to do with many of the ancient Sage and religious ideas that have come down to Man. Today it&rsquo;s passing now as Eastern Philosophy, but it&rsquo;s not true, it&rsquo;s not new, it was never new, it has always been with Man, the art of meditation has always been with Man but in different countries and in different environment / culture, it was presented differently, but we are familiar with so much that even when we hear it, we cannot even recognize it. Jesus used to refer to it so many times in His speech and Moses and many other great men referred to meditation in simple terms, how to stay in the present. Moses once said when he was in deep meditation, he heard this inner consciousness telling him to go down in the land of Egypt and tell the Jewish people to prepare to leave and go with him, but what would he tell this people, who was this God giving this command that he should tell them, what was the God&rsquo;s name because that&rsquo;s the way they would think. If you came down from the mountain top and said, &ldquo;God told me to tell you people here now from now on you follow me and forget about working for these people,&rdquo; well this wouldn&rsquo;t work because you could imagine what would happen. First thing somebody says, &ldquo;Well, where you gonna feed us? Where are we gonna sleep tonight? And who is this God, what&rsquo;s his name? How do I know you&rsquo;re telling me the truth, man I got a beautiful house over there so far, it&rsquo;s a cell alright, it&rsquo;s a chain around my handcuff, but still a place not in the desert.&rdquo; Look at the arguments that would go on just because somebody come and say that they had to follow someone out and go away, you can see all types of arguments to set up. Now Moses was only told one thing, that the God that spoke to him had one name and this God&rsquo;s name was I AM that I AM, it never said to go and tell the people my name was Jehovah, you see. When Moses heard this inner consciousness inside from his meditation, he heard it saying, &ldquo;I AM that I AM.&rdquo; Now how would these people who are not ever thinking in the present, they were always thinking of yesterday how much pain they endured and tomorrow how soon break their chains and get away. In the meantime they did their work totally ignoring where they were and just being satisfied what they were doing, but their minds were fluctuating between what happened to them yesterday or what will happen to them tomorrow and someone to come and tell them, &ldquo;Listen you can overcome this particular pressure by centering your mind in the present and thinking of the Divinity in your and calling on the I AM.&rdquo; You know what they&rsquo;ll tell him? &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nuts.&rdquo; And that is exactly what they would tell him because they could not comprehend, the individual would not comprehend why the present, why the Divinity was in the present, he couldn&rsquo;t think. Why would one person say God is in the present, why is not my God sitting on a throne, he could not understand that. So it took him quite awhile to get to them, even when after all the work he did to help them get free from the Egyptians, they still weren&rsquo;t content, they were still arguing among themselves, eventually he got to a point where he was pretty disgusted with them, but nevertheless in his writings he made a point to state that God was the eternal I AM within everything. Now this word &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; does not refer to the body, now it refers to everything in this universe. Now if every object in this universe including yourself and myself were to say I AM as to identify ourselves, we would be only parts of one big I AM, parts of the same thing themselves are equal to one another, right, it&rsquo;s what you learn in mathematics, two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another. So when you love your neighbor as yourself, that&rsquo;s loving yourself as one another and isn&rsquo;t that what Jesus used to say, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind and heart and love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; He was speaking mathematics too, but He didn&rsquo;t come outright and hit you on the head and told you it was mathematics but you learn it today in school as mathematics, these two things are equal to the same thing and therefore they themselves are equal to each other. So if we are equal to the Divine I AM and if we are part of the Divine I AM, then we are all equal as I AM too, you see we are the same thing. Now Moses knew this, Jesus knew this and all the great Teachers through time knew this, all the Greek philosophers knew it, but in the period they taught it and to the people they taught it were such a select few that even they themselves were afraid to expose it or follow it lest the whole community turn around and hang them up you know like we had a bunch of witch hunters in Salem one time hanging the poor, innocent people, calling them witches when actually they were people who had a certain ability or extra-sensory ability, which we know today is a natural ability, and they killed these people because these people are able to live in the present. Most of us are unable to live in the present, we are either living in the past or in the future, and the present is very hard to do. Meditation helps us to stay in the present and it helps us to understand ourselves better, why things happen to us and how to cope with the thing. Now it also insulates you, you know you need a vaccination against chickenpox, chickenpox is something alien outside of yourself and the vaccination is something you put inside. Now you have no vaccination for stress / anxiety except tranquilizers they sell in the market or a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, but how long can you live on those to avoid stress or anxiety from the environment. Nature has built within the human body a natural tranquilizer, now remember the word tranquilizer what it represents, it supposed to be some chemical that will make you tranquil, make you stay at peace, make you stay calm and think in the present, cope with the present situation, not drift around in your thinking. Now if nature already built within you a tranquilizer, this tranquilizer would be somewhere located in this mechanism. 0:50 Now how to locate it? If we go into scriptural writings, (inaudible), the men who spent their time trying to find tranquility, this was their whole aim, they tried to research into their own bodies the source of tranquility, the source of serenity, the source of peace ended up coming back to the source of the the conscious I AM which they called God and realizing within themselves that this source was located right within themselves, it was not outside of themselves. Now one great Master by the name of Jesus who said, &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you,&rdquo; see He says within you, &ldquo;and all these things will be added unto you.&rdquo; Now remember we&rsquo;re trying to seek tranquility and our minds drift either to something concerning the past or the future so how is it going to be possible for us to seek tranquility when your minds won&rsquo;t allow us to stay stationary in the present, it just shifts back and forth and here we are told by a teacher to seek this thing, the source of this inner consciousness, within ourselves, but He did not leave us without a way how to seek, how to go in and find tranquility. Now He says &ldquo;If thine eyes are single, the whole body is full of light&rdquo; and &ldquo;come unto Me all ye that travail and are heavily laden and I will refresh you.&rdquo; Now where would you go inside and where would your eyes be single inside if your eyes be single? If you take two eyes and try to focus it, it would be right here, so in prayer we see people putting their eyes like that and they&rsquo;re praying, they&rsquo;re watching too. Unconsciously they are doing exactly what is required for them to focus their mind and become single, stay in the present, now fluctuate between past and future, but remain in the present keeping their consciousness single or focused on the present where they are and at the same time they are returning inward from having struggled, travail and heavily laden are struggling through your five senses fluctuating back and forth with anxiety and frustration in order now to find refreshment, tranquility, peace, a new source of strength of inspiration and at the same time they are looking inward, not outwards, they&rsquo;re fulfilling all the requirements by returning here. Now this returning here has been classified by the Sages as meditation, that is the mind is generating certain amount of energy to direct our individual thought activities towards an intuitive observation and oneness with God or noumena, the mind is doing this for us, it&rsquo;s bringing us back to God and the Saints are telling us we have to go back in, not out, but in so if we have to go back in then what is the first experience we will have when we go back in? We have to ask the Saints themselves, the Masters themselves, what is the first experience and see if They gave an answer for the first experience and let&rsquo;s see if the experience coincides with the observation that you make by staying in present, if the answer is the same. Jesus said &ldquo;The peace I give, the world can&rsquo;t give&rdquo; now the world is outside of you and that cannot bring peace because you may have to resort to tranquilizers to stay at peace with your environment, but the peace that the I, the I AM gives and this inner self gives that when you turn-in is different, but remember I said before if you look at the I AM, I AM, every time you say I AM, you are saying something in the present tense, right, in language, grammer it&rsquo;s always in the present tense, I AM is not past, it&rsquo;s not future, it&rsquo;s always now. So I AM that I AM is referring all the time to a present condition, to the present state and it&rsquo;s referring to a oneness because God is one not two, it&rsquo;s not a futuristic condition, it&rsquo;s not a past condition, you&rsquo;re not praying to a deity who lives in the past, you&rsquo;re not praying to a god who lives in the future, he would have to be the god who lives in the present you see. So we are always going to be exposed constantly thinking, constantly worshipping and loving God in the present and by so doing we also would be living in the present and experiencing the present. Now if we don&rsquo;t understand why the present is the source, we have the evidence when these Masters say we have to look into the present. Now the present exposes the truth of God in us, it shows us that God really is in us as the present I AM, it&rsquo;s a state in which the mind and all the attention is focused on. Now &ldquo;thou shalt have no other graven image before Me,&rdquo; that is the first commandment Moses was told to write down, &ldquo;I am the Lord thy God, I AM the Lord thy God,&rdquo; not a creature but the I AM principle, the present force, the eternal present, the eternal now, the eternal truth, this is the Lord to which we turn to, this is the real self, this is the real unity, not this physical body, but It&rsquo;s a principle that holds us up. It is a principle of Truth that stands for everything around us, the I AM principle. Now this is life itself and it&rsquo;s the same time peace because it brings out the peace in us. The only time you&rsquo;re gonna feel peace is when you stop thinking of tomorrow and you stop thinking of yesterday and just feel yourself right now. Sitting in the room at this present moment exactly what, half past two, in this particular date of this particular month, this particular instant, this particular second of awareness you are living in relation to the very next breath, see how identified you are, the very next breath is life, the very next breath. Now take away the eyes, you can do without it because people have lived without sight, take away the ears there are people who have lived without it, did not hear, take away the nose there are people who cannot smell, no sense of smell, take away the mouth, people cannot talk, but there is no one who can live without breathing. So we see every instant we breath we are alive and this is something that we are conscious of in the present, we are not conscious of it tomorrow, we cannot take tomorrow&rsquo;s breath now and you cannot take yesterday&rsquo;s breath back, you see. What has gone in the last second is not gonna come back and if you&rsquo;re gonna hope to breath the next breath before you breath it, the human body is not going to use it, your lungs can&rsquo;t use what you&rsquo;re gonna breath in the next half an hour right away, it could only use what comes into it as it comes in and use it to its fullest. Now because this is actually happening to us because this is reality, we cannot escape this, we cannot hide from it, we have to learn to accept and understand it and we have to understand the spirituality of it, we have to understand the Divinity in it, we couldn&rsquo;t invent it, there&rsquo;s no human physical person in this universe that could invent the next breath. So we know definitely we are the result of a Divine principle, but this Divine principle becomes so commonplace conversation today that we give lip service to the reality of it, we don&rsquo;t understand what God is yet you see. 1:00 We know God exists, but we don&rsquo;t know how He exists, we know God is in us, we are told this by the great Saints, great Teachers, but we have no way to experience how He exists in us. What is it in us that we are supposed to experience to represent Him, you see. If we have this thing pointed out to us then we can begin to experience what we are supposed to experience and no longer drift in our mind, no longer live in anxiety, no longer live in frustration or in fear or in worry or in greed or in anger, we would automatically feel our real nature, our true nature, we begin to feel peace for the first time. Now this peace brings with it strength, this is one of the peculiar things about all the spiritual men, having discovered God as the one principle, the I AM principle, by looking into the present and by turning in which is meditating now, shutting the eyes and feeling this flow the next breath, the next impulse, the next inspiration, recognizing this as the source of their existence, they then began to feel the peace. Now this was a peace that Jesus spoke of, &ldquo;the peace I give,&rdquo; not &ldquo;I Jesus&rdquo; give because His body is gone, it is the principle that holds Jesus up gives to every form, this I AM principle that was in Jesus is the same I AM principle that is in you and it is this I AM principle that will make you conscious of peace that is existing in you, this is the peace that will come to you when you look inside. I Jesus is saying to you people of the present period He was living that the I AM principle within My mechanism which &ldquo;I and My Father are one&rdquo; because this principle is God already, this principle is existing in me already holding my physical frame up together, is saying to you people who are looking for a Messiah coming some time next year or looking for one that hasn&rsquo;t come yet or one who has come and gone, they were all praying for some thing, they were looking for something in the future and here He&rsquo;s showing them that what they were really searching for was deep down within themselves, it&rsquo;s locked up inside themselves, it was their own self, not their mere physical self as a person or ego, it was their real spiritual self that held them together as a unit as a human being as a result of Divine laws, it was that self they were supposed to look to, it was that self He was identified with, it was that self that He was trying to be a channel for so that they could feel an experience in their anxiety, in their so called hardship and slavery and occupation by the Romans, they would have something now, some inner strength to turn to, something to offset the stresses and start to inoculate or vaccinate their spiritual lives against outside pressures. They don&rsquo;t have to resort to drugs or some tranquilizing chemical to become calm at the end of the day after they work so hard in the field or under the yolk of the Roman soldiers, it was something that they could resort back into themselves and be content and understand themselves and build back their spiritual life, build back their inner life, but the people were not ready for such a transformation and they were not looking for that type of transformation or that type of a freedom from the environmental pressure, they were looking for some man riding on a huge white horse or plodding on weilding a fiery sword knocking down all the oppressors and reinstating them back as a nation you see. That&rsquo;s what their concept of a liberator you see. Now he was not liberating them in a political sense, he was not out to liberate the people in a political sense, he is out to liberate them in a psychological / behavioral sense, something that had to do with their inner attitude, something that had to do with their maturity as a person and how to live as a person. He knew that there would always be invaders, he knew there would always come people creating wars and taking away people&rsquo;s lands and enslaving people, this would always go on from then up to now it&rsquo;s still going on. Man is still fighting Man to enslave him, but how many would take away a man&rsquo;s inner peace or his inner awareness of himself and reduce him to an utter helpless creature if that man knew how to maintain his identity with God and throughout the ages many such men were subjected to every type of torture and did not falter, like Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den, many such wonderful men had the realization that no amount of oppression could take away them from their I AM self, could take away the love of the presence of God right now, see what I mean? This is what he was trying to reestablish in his people, these people had this brought to them, they nurtured this wonderful realization, then it died because of the oppression, the enslavement, and he was just trying to reactivate something that they had neglected. That&rsquo;s why he used to say to them, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pray like the Gentiles,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t pray like the people who are begging all the time for God to hand them something, these things are going to be here all the time rather go back inside again, gain this inner strength, and no matter what occupation or government control, you would as an individual now, not as a whole race of people, not as a whole world of people, you as an individual who would take up this opportunity to observe yourself as an expression of Divinity, you would now free yourself in a behavioral way, in mature way, from the environment with all its stresses, all its frustrations and all its anxieties even in its poverty or its richness, you would have the one real gift that everyone is craving for, you would have the gift of peace. You would be able to cope with all the conditions that come along and still not find it tearing you down, you&rsquo;re not a victim of the environment no more, you are now truly master of the environment, you are truly one with the Divine living from within now and this was his whole central emphasis, how to go in, how to strengthen oneself. Well normally if you say to someone, &ldquo;well so what, I am peaceful, I can think of peace therefore I am peaceful.&rdquo; Well the challenge is this or the test is this, to say &ldquo;I am peaceful&rdquo; and someone gets you in an argument and before you know it you start to get angry at each other and while you&rsquo;re busy angry with each other, the telephone rings and you pick up the phone and it&rsquo;s your prime and choice boyfriend, all the anger flies out your mind and here you&rsquo;re all smiles and happiness. What happened, you see? From one state you flipped to the next state and the moment the phone conversation is over, then you pickup again your argument, you flip back and forth, you see what is happening? We are then victim again of an environmental condition. Now meditation is to help to learn to adjust and help us to realize what we are, what our neighbor are, why they think a certain way and why we think a certain way, or why they are entitled to think a certain way without imposing or trying to hurt you or without you trying to hurt them. Now if two things are equal to the same thing, then they themselves are equal to one another, but these two things may not know they are equal to one another. One may know that they are equal to the one thing which is equal to the other thing, but the other one may not know, you see. 1:10 Now this is why Jesus says &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God&rdquo; which is the one thing, &ldquo;with all your mind and heart and love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; Now this &ldquo;loving your neighbor as yourself&rdquo; is equality, these two things are equal to themselves because if you love yourself and love your neighbor as yourself, this is automatically equality because you can&rsquo;t love me by hitting me, you can&rsquo;t love yourself by hitting yourself. You know I have a friend that I was telling him, just came out of college and I says &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t love yourself as your neighbor.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;well how should I love myself as my neighbor, how should I love my neighbor as myself.&rdquo; I says &ldquo;well first you gotta be good to yourself before you can be good to your neighbor.&rdquo; So there&rsquo;s a big pile of food on the table, he says &ldquo;ok I love my neighbor,&rdquo; he took the whole pot and put it in front, he says &ldquo;none for you folks, that&rsquo;s how I love my neighbor.&rdquo; (Adano laughing). So I says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a very good example of how you love yourself, you don&rsquo;t wanna give us a tummy ache, he says &ldquo;ok, have some.&rdquo; You see this is the thing you see, we are not realizing what we doing but once we begin to realize that if you have anger in yourself and you&rsquo;re angry with yourself, you&rsquo;re gonna transfer it to the next person you get angry with and if you&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;re gonna transfer happiness. You see you did it when you got to the phone because your friend called you on the phone, you&rsquo;re happy, you transferred the happiness, then you start back on the person who you are arguing again so you are transferring what you are. That&rsquo;s how we say we are loving ourself, it&rsquo;s not really how we are loving ourself, we are just flipping back and forth from various moods. Now to truly love ourselves we must understand that this Divine Presence is in us, so if it&rsquo;s in us then it&rsquo;s in you. Now if I don&rsquo;t love to hurt myself, why should I wanna hurt, I know what it is to be cut and see my blood run, I know what it is to fall down and bang a bone or something, then why should I want to bang you? Don&rsquo;t I realize that the same thing would happen to you, that you&rsquo;d feel the same pain, but it&rsquo;s hard for someone to say that another person who has never felt it you see, until one has felt these things, he doesn&rsquo;t know what the other person is feeling. That&rsquo;s why you see the only way we can know how another person would feel, we would have to experience. Now we don&rsquo;t have to experience all the aches and pains to know what pain is, one pain every one of us have had some experience with a toothache and a toothache is not a nice thing to have. Now you get to the dentist and by the time you there the ache is gone, you don&rsquo;t want the tooth to be pulled out so when you leave the dentist and you don&rsquo;t take the tooth out you know and drive back home, it starts aching again and you want to get back to the dentist. Well this is the same thing you see, you&rsquo;re playing a tug-of-war with &ldquo;to take it out or not take it out,&rdquo; your mind is flipping back and forth you see, this is a peculiar thing, here you have this problem. Alright, but this is exactly what happened to one other person who has the bad tooth, it&rsquo;s a common experience, we begin to see now what Jesus and all the great Teachers were saying that the common experience of two things equal to one thing were themselves equal to one another. Both parties are experiencing a toothache, it&rsquo;s a common experience a bad tooth aching, the pain is equal just the same as much in your mouth as in my mouth if we both have it at the same time you see. So we know now this is a common experience we are gonna happen, so &ldquo;love your neighbor as yourself&rdquo; is to experience within yourself what these things are and what makes for peace. So if you&rsquo;re trying to experience peace, the person is gonna turn inward. Now the first experience that you do encounter in meditation as I said before is peace. Now, and by staying in the present, Now or the I AM, you do begin to experience this peace. Now when you begin to experience peace, your mind has changed now from wandering to centering to calmness to focusing to stationary and before you know it, you are gaining strength, you&rsquo;re becoming more aware of where you are, who you are, and how you function. So these are three things you begin to observe from the meditative practice: one peace / tranquility or serenity, two you become more aware you&rsquo;re not just a limited little person no more, you&rsquo;re not living in a little shell, you have a greater appreciation for everyone around you now, you have a greater sense of cooperation because what they are feeling, they may be adult or younger than you, they are feeling, and you do not know how much they are feeling only when you feel it yourself, then you have that much to measure. When someone says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel good today,&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t say to yourself &ldquo;what is that, I don&rsquo;t feel it,&rdquo; but when you don&rsquo;t feel good you know how to put on tantrums to make sure everyone knows that you don&rsquo;t feel good. So this is a truth you see because it&rsquo;s a common experience and this is an awareness, this is knowing. Now comes the strength is that the environment don&rsquo;t make you afraid no more, you&rsquo;re no longer afraid of your environment, you&rsquo;re no longer afraid to cross over the street or to stand up on your own two legs and talk back. When I say talk back I don&rsquo;t mean in a sassy way or trying to prove a point, but you are capable of holding your own within your legitimate right as a person, without being afraid. This is a strength that comes to you, this is something you can cope. It comes to you and you cope with your environment you see. Now this strength is what you are trying everyday to acquire in work, in study, in association in the married life, or anything, business or otherwise, this is a strength that comes with you as a person. Now this is what the Saints were trying to teach Man in the first place that he can have peace, he can have the awareness of himself, and he can have the inner strength as to who he really is and also where to look for it. Most of us do not know where to look for it, yet we are told so many times where to look for it, we are told to look right here, right between the eyebrows, &ldquo;when the eyes are single, the whole body is full of light,&rdquo; we are told to look there. Now when we look we are told we will see light, LIGHT, the whole body is full of it and we are told that the light shines in the darkness of the brain, shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehends it not, this is what we are also told, that this light exists in all of us and if we turn our eyes in we will see this light and that this light exists in the darkness of our brain, but the five senses don&rsquo;t know what it is. Sometimes you close your eyes and you see a little flash of light and you think something is wrong with your eyes so you forget about it or you may be lying on your bed at night, the lights are out, and then all of a sudden you start half awake, half asleep, not completely full asleep, you see like a little coloring like you are starting to dream, like a haze, but you don&rsquo;t know what it is and then you forget all about it. It&rsquo;s only because you are slowly being drawn back to yourself, unknown to yourself you&rsquo;re being drawn back to yourself to come and look inside of yourself, but because no one tells you how to look inside of yourself or where to look inside of yourself, you don&rsquo;t look inside. Yet some people because it persists so often that when they&rsquo;re by themselves, nobody interfers with them and they lie down and they start thinking what they&rsquo;ve done for the day, a good many of us do this, a sort of review of what we&rsquo;ve done for the day before we fall asleep, you know it&rsquo;s just like they say you&rsquo;re praying because they say pray before you go to bed, &ldquo;now I lay me down to sleep, I give the Lord my soul to keep.&rdquo; These are all good because this is what we&rsquo;re growing up with but we are gonna make these words, these ideas now, a tangible experience. 1:20 We&rsquo;re going to try to experience now, not just lip service for these ideas that came to us by our parents or by society or by the church or by the environment, we as a person now are going to try to realize for the first time in our own lives and experience within our own lives the truth of these things. You see this is the conflict that is going on, this is the psychological revolution of the present generation between the junior and the adult, the age gap. The adult has given lip service to truth and has retained it as custom and the junior is no longer content with the lip service because it doesn&rsquo;t fit into the framework of the immediate environment, it doesn&rsquo;t fit into what they have to cope with by convention that they are forced to school up to a certain age and stay within certain restricted forms of thinking because their lives are not reinforced, they have nothing to fall back on to reinforce their lives to cope with the educational system, let alone to cope with the environment and its pressures, let alone cope with all the changing luxuries around us that we need to stay young, beautiful, and dynamic. So we are caught in it but if we realize that we can bridge this gap and by bridging this gap is by experimenting, by experience, by trying to experience what has been handed to us, what has been told to us for a first time in a tangible way. Don&rsquo;t be afraid if your parent says what you believe in is ridiculous, they don&rsquo;t know until they try it themselves. If you have tried it and you can experience and see the change that you are becoming every day peaceful, every day more aware of yourself as a person, more tender in nature, more human in nature and the strength to face any circumstance, you can vouch for what you are doing as genuine, it&rsquo;s up to them to find out for themselves. In the first place no parent would want that to happen that the child convert them, but we&rsquo;ve always seen that they say &ldquo;out of the mouths of babes come truth,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s where we have the teachers of truth throw it back in our laps and tell us &ldquo;you better listen to the kid, he&rsquo;s got something on the ball once in a while.&rdquo; This happens in every generation within the age gap of every generation, it is nothing new, today it&rsquo;s more magnified because more people are involved in it, it&rsquo;s more publicized because more people are exposed to it, you understand, and the communication systems have pushed us closer to each other. Centuries ago we were scattered about and your closest neighbor might be in Austin and how many hours you would have to go. Now we don&rsquo;t have to, we get in a car and fly over there or in a plane and that&rsquo;s it because we are pushed closer to each other, but the problems are still the same problems of behavior, the search for tranquility, the search for awareness, the search for inner strength still goes on and the environment and all its advancements will continue to go on. The occupation of country over country stills go on, but we as people have to make the change from inside and the teachers of truth are not going to give us anything new, they&rsquo;re going to tell us the same thing over and over and over till it becomes like a broken gramophone record you know. I&rsquo;ve heard this story over and over, but they will always come to help us experience it, this is the reason why they come, this is why they live for it, they will live in the world all the time, those people who will help you to experience the three fundamental principles of life: how to go inside, how to be aware of yourself, and how to maintain the inner strength to cope with the environment. You see the environment is an alien place for all of us, we have to learn how to survive in it, many of us never learn how to survive in the environment that they&rsquo;re born into and many take to it like a duck takes to water, some are very sharp and very alert in surviving, others can&rsquo;t, they have to learn all by trial and error. Yet the Sages have realized this to be so, therefore they left us certain rules how to prepare ourselves, how to insulate ourselves against these conditions so that we can cope with our environment, we can maintain peace so we&rsquo;re not carried away by the pressures of the environment and we don&rsquo;t have to resort to chemicals to bring on this inner awareness of peace or be the victim of a doctor all the time you know, not to go to doctors because you&rsquo;re having tension. Now teachers of truth point out that God exists, the followers of truth have made a mess as to what God really is and how He exists. Now if all the teachers of truth got together and sat down in a room, there would be no argument between the two of them as to what God is, but if the students of all those teachers got together, we&rsquo;d have a war immediately and we&rsquo;d be looking for the largest weapon to hit each other with. This is true because each one will think his teacher is better, your teacher is worse and before you know it, they&rsquo;re arguing for supremacy as to what the thing is. The very teachers themselves are going to sit down and what will occur, they will be in a state of peace, they will be in a state of inner communion, and inner recognition of the equality of two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another, you see. They gonna have divine mathematics occurring with them, they gonna know that &ldquo;here within me is life, here within you is life, life and life is one and the same, and if life and life is one and the same, then we are both one and the same from within each other,&rdquo; see we share life from within, this is the equality of ourselves. Now you have to take the breath out of the atmosphere to sustain yourself, I have to take it from the atmosphere to sustain myself, you see. So the teachers of truth are never going to argue, but the students will always argue because each teacher lives in a particular period in a particular type of custom in a particular language structure and a particular need for those people and would have to present that same one truth, that same one universal equality, that same one universal love, that same one attempt to be at peace with his environment according to how he find his environment or his customs that he has to work with, those customs are the things he has to work with, these are his tools. Now the students, they&rsquo;re the ones that are caught up in the problem, they&rsquo;re the ones that are gonna make a mess with after they&rsquo;ve been exposed to it for awhile. When the teacher is gone that happens all the time, you find the students arguing among themselves and breaking up into little groups. This is exactly what happened to all the religions that have come down to us. Now we reach a stage as modern man, more so as industrial man, not modern man, industrial man, see there are only two types of civilizations: agricultural civilization and industrial civilization. We are not yet evolved into what is called the psychological civilization, we are gonna in time when we move and begin to live in space, but we are now evolving from the agricultural civilization into an industrial civilization. The industrial civilization is where our world around us is based strictly on mechanical movement, machinery and so forth. Our agricultural environment was based on the horse carriage and the farm, but we all to certain extent deep down in us have a yearning for the farm and we find ourselves out of place in the industrial society. This proves to us that we didn&rsquo;t live once, we lived many times, it gives us the realization that there is no end to life, one body form of twenty or fifty or sixty years is not enough an exposure to the wholeness of life. Now Jesus even told His disciples that, He says &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house there are many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you. If it were no so, I would tell you.&rdquo; In other words, if they&rsquo;re all going to be turned saints over the short period of being exposed to Him, what becomes of them when they give up their frame in the physical world and He&rsquo;s telling them there&rsquo;s no end to such a thing. 1:30 In other words they will go on to higher forms of existence, higher levels of behavior, and that this universe is so large that it would be quite preposterous to think that we&rsquo;re the only creatures, we&rsquo;re the only ones with knowledge, knowing it all. If you look outside at night there are teeming millions, billions of moving objects in the atmosphere, you start to realize that we don&rsquo;t really understand, but yet within the very knowledge that is left to us there is a way to understand it and begin to see it and to begin to experience it, this is what we are trying to do. Now the teachers of truth have said that we can, with the changing environment no matter where we find ourselves in the agricultural, in this industrial, or the psychological, those people who have seen that picture called 2001, to the end of the picture it is a psychological argument between machine and man you know, have you see that? This is strictly a psychological condition that is going on between a machinery and a human being, eventually the machine gave way to the human power of will and he performed an electronic lobotomy on his brain and cut out what was unnecessary. You should see that picture because you will see how man is evolving from his agricultural environment up into his industrial environment into the psychological environment. At the same time our behavior is still following us the same way, it&rsquo;s not changing, although we have changed the environment, we have changed from agricultural to industrial and eventually going into space now, we&rsquo;re not changing behavior, we&rsquo;re not changing the very fundamental things about ourselves, this is still remaining with us, we are still arguing, we&rsquo;re still fighting, you understand, we&rsquo;re still looking for peace inside of ourselves and we&rsquo;re searching more and more for answers for the peace that no one seems to supply the answers. Yet the very scriptures that have been left to us, the very teachings of these Sages, point out a way. Now it is nothing new that I&rsquo;m going to tell you or it&rsquo;s nothing new that you didn&rsquo;t hear, I&rsquo;m only saying that from now on it is possible by experimental research and by personal experience to experience what these Sages spoke of and to see it for the first time as something within the range of a personal life and it&rsquo;s in the range of personal strength, also it brings on a personal integrity of your own self, it brings on the heightening of your character as a person. You begin to realize or experiment or partake in something far more genuine than the mere lip service that has been passed on. Now this is no fault of the adult, no fault of the environment, no fault of the education system that we did not have enough exposure to practice or comprehend this truth about ourself, it is because there was no one coming forward to open the doors for us. You have to have people who will open the doors for us and in every age we&rsquo;ve had such people, we always have them, in fact they always keep going you know, these are people who come constantly in different times under different customs and traditions and re-announce, re-validate the one truth by clearing up all the myths, all the illusions around it and allow us to partake and experience it. Now this is what they&rsquo;re trying to point out that today with all the Beatles and all this movement, the Maharishi who is traveling around trying to tell people about meditation, it&rsquo;s nothing new. The emphasis is how to experience it, this is the emphasis that meditation will always be with us, our behavioral patterns will always be with us, but how to make this an experience, how to make this a tangible thing within ourselves, how can we identify with an inner peace that would stay with us, how can we carry this into our waking life and live with it and really feel peace. Now this peace does not make you into an insensitive person or it doesn&rsquo;t make you unaware of where you are, this peace, this joy, this inner consciousness heightens all the qualities of a person. What was once crude in you becomes very polished out, what is not tender in you becomes tender in you because different parts of you begin to open up to realize that you are much more than just an ordinary person plodding your way through life being a victim of circumstances, you can now direct this consciousness and these teachers have shown a way how to go in, they say &ldquo;look here and watch&rdquo; and I said before they say &ldquo;you will see light.&rdquo; Now when you see light normally light is associated with color so if you sit down to meditate and remember Moses said when he was meditating he saw a burning bush on a mountain. Well this is an allegorical statement in Moses&rsquo; own writing, there might have been on the mountain Sinai that is in Jerusalem or Palestine, there might have been a tree there that was actually burning, but it&rsquo;ll go deeper than that, if Moses actually had an inner experience of saying the God that spoke to him was the I AM that I AM that was the name of the God that told him to go down and help the Jewish people, he would have to have a deeper experience than just to go and see a tree burning on top of a mountaintop and this tree was talking. Now it would have to be something far deeper inside of him, now if it is something deeper than that and if it is something far more tangible than that, if it&rsquo;s within the range of experience, then we have to go to another source of information to see where it ties in, to see how it will tie in with us today. Jesus said in His time, Jesus was after Moses now, He says &ldquo;when thine eyes are single, the body is full of light&rdquo; and burning bush would indicate light and if light is the thing we want to see and light exists within us and light is here in the darkness it says, then Moses did see the inner light, the light that this human body is composed of. 1:40 Now modern science, doctors today and scientists, can vouch beyond all reasonable doubt by mechanical machinery that this brain of ours, everyone from the lowest Hottentot or primitive in Africa, there is enough electrical power in the brain to light up a 25 watt bulb when they hook it on. Now if the brain can send out that much electrical power to light a 25 watt bulb, and this is positive fact, and we don&rsquo;t even use more than one tenth portion of it to perform our daily activities, nine tenths portion is inactive, you see that the great men were talking of something deep down inside that they knew, they saw this inside themselves, that there is a light burning from within because this body is all light, this body is energy, this body is the result of consciousness and energy, it&rsquo;s a Divine principle. Now they say that this body is the temple of God too and they also say that when God created the universe, He made man in His own image and likeness, He made him from an atomic principle and He endowed him with an omnipresent awareness, that&rsquo;s His own likeness because if you&rsquo;re going to go to God you would say that God would be the only person that would know everything. So He&rsquo;s everywhere and if He&rsquo;s everywhere, he&rsquo;s omnipresent and if He&rsquo;s omnipresent, He&rsquo;s all powerful already and if He&rsquo;s all powerful, He&rsquo;s all knowing. So this would be a state of awareness that would be in an individual who has realized himself that this goes on, but that&rsquo;s not what we want to find, what we want to establish is that we know where to go now, we know what we&rsquo;re looking for, we now want to experience it, you see. If we didn&rsquo;t know where to go and what we&rsquo;re looking for, then we would not be able to experience it, you see. Now you know&hellip; what&rsquo;s that cafeteria not too far from here? Audience: (inaudible). Adano: Haliburton? You know where Haliburton cafeteria is, now you know what you want to eat when you get there, you see, but if you don&rsquo;t know you wouldn&rsquo;t go. Once you have established a destination, once you&rsquo;ve established some facts about what we&rsquo;re doing then you go, you see. If you don&rsquo;t have these things established you don&rsquo;t, you could not partake, you could not eat at the cafeteria because you don&rsquo;t know where it is. It&rsquo;s the same thing here, you cannot experience the peace you are looking for outside, but you&rsquo;re told now to look inside and what to look for inside? They say to look for a light that is shining in there. Now also Jesus said in His own words, He says &ldquo;Though heaven and earth will pass away, not one word of Mine shall away.&rdquo; Now how many thousand years and men are still saying up to this very day there is a light in here and those who have experienced it will vouch that there is a light in there and they&rsquo;d rather die, no matter how many people try to enslave them or try to make them disbelieve the light is not there, they would prefer to give up their life for the light that is in there because they have proven it themselves. So we know then that we look inside, we have the location, we know what we are looking for, it&rsquo;s a light that&rsquo;s in there and what that light represents for us, that light is the light of God in Man, it dwells in Man all the time. It&rsquo;s the same light that Moses saw, it&rsquo;s the same light that Jesus talked about, and the churches have kept what is called a light burning to symbolize it, to remind them, but they have made an issue of the one in the church and not of this one. They have made us more conscious of the light outside burning in the church than the light burning within the temple of ourself because many of them did not experience this light and since they did not experience this light, they became convinced that there was no such light, that that was the light they had to look for, that was the light they had to preserve. So they went looking for material things to preserve that light and gave up trying to perserve or explore this light. Now we have the age gap, the age gap occurs in every generation, in every period, the struggle for experience. Today the youth wants the experience because in this particular environment we are restricted up to a certain age bracket before they can be an adult or think like an adult so they are demanding experience. Colleges and universities are not bringing out or producing experience because these are not people who research into the inner self, these are people who are researching like the man trying to find another way to keep that light burning outside. Now we&rsquo;re not saying that you must disregard the light outside for the light inside or disregard the light inside for the light outside, we are saying make the balance because both are important. You need the outside light to work with, you need the inside light to cope with the outside world, you see. So you need both, this light helps you to find that one, that one helps you to find your way around outside, you understand. So many of the inventive men found the light inside of themselves too before they made the discovery on the outside too you see, they were talking the same thing. So Jesus and all these teachers are saying that when you meditate you look inside of yourself and you&rsquo;re communing with God all the time as the light and you listen in the right ear that this sound, this Divine melody or God&rsquo;s music, is resounding all around you inside. Now Saint John wrote in his book, he says &ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo; that at the very start of Creative Life, &ldquo;there was the Word,&rdquo; there was sound, a Divine melody, the Divine force and &ldquo;in this Word was with God&rdquo; that is this Word was present in the consciousness of God and that this Word was God. Now two things equal to the same things are themselves equal to one another, we finding out that this Divine sound is already there and it is the God principle in Man and this Word, this same Word, was made flesh, that means it slowed down became matter &ldquo;and dwelt in Man&rdquo; proving that the Divinity chose this particular structure, of all the structures in the universe, to locate Itself, to allow It to evolve to its highest nature. He didn&rsquo;t pick no other structure, He didn&rsquo;t pick this structure, He didn&rsquo;t pick this structure, He picked this structure of all the structures that were around Him, He picked this structure to slow down and identify and locate Itself, the Divine Intelligence. So we see now why this is such an important function, we don&rsquo;t have to abuse it, we have to take care of it, but some people say &ldquo;cleanliness is next to Godliness&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t mean only outward cleanliness, inward cleanliness too. You know we can be outwardly clean, but pretty dirty in our thoughts or pretty dirty by the food we eat too you see, that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything, cleanliness is Godliness or next to Godliness meaning that both in consciousness, both in nutrition, both in environmental association, these are the cleanliness that they&rsquo;re talking about, how to maintain a calm mind, how to maintain a healthy body, and how to realize the intelligence dormant and residing in the body. Now the Saints did not say it was outside, it was inside, now they made the test and they verified and they said it was up to everyone to do it because this is individualistic, they cannot do it for us and you can&rsquo;t eat for me and I couldn&rsquo;t eat for her. So if this is individualistic, if this is totally a personal experience, then age doesn&rsquo;t play any important part in this thing, has nothing to do with how old you are or how young you are since this is individualistic, you see. Now you cannot force the next person to follow you, that&rsquo;s him or her own obligation or responsibility to make their own discovery. You are only going to make the discovery in relation to yourself, you&rsquo;re going establish your identity as a part of the Divinity, you&rsquo;re going to realize your Divinity inside yourself, but you&rsquo;re not going to force it on anyone because they may not be ready to accept it. 1:50 Now you&rsquo;re not concerned if they don&rsquo;t accept anything and you&rsquo;re not going to try to hurt them by being ultra different from them, you&rsquo;re living in the world like everyone, but you know where to go inside to be apart from the world and all its environmental pressures so you&rsquo;re not caught up in it. You have a portable reservoir or paradise of peace that you can go to everyday, anytime you want and identify and no one can take it away from you, they cannot imprison you, they cannot take your life and rob you from it, they can take away all your money but they cannot take away this inner consciousness, it yours. This is one thing that no man can take from you that&rsquo;s why Jesus says &ldquo;No man can taketh my life, I lay it down and I can pick it up.&rdquo; I know how to go inside and experience Divine peace and I know how to destroy it too. If you know how to go inside and experience peace, you know how to destroy it by just living on the outside, get involved on the outside and you&rsquo;ll destroy it pretty fast, no one can do that but you yourself, you see. You make the choice of either to stay inside or to stay on the outside or to learn to move from inside, outside, you have this and each one must do it for themselves, learn to move inside, outside. True meditation is constantly or you&rsquo;re constantly exposed to it, you begin to experience this inner peace. Now it&rsquo;s said that you will see a light inside and you will hear a sound, well normally we don&rsquo;t hear the sound right away or some people hear it right away depending on their evolution, some of see the light right away, some of us don&rsquo;t see the light right away, but what we all experience no matter who it is, we all experience peace from the very start. Now this is the one thing Jesus said He came to give, He didn&rsquo;t come to give us the light, He came to tell us that the light existed, He didn&rsquo;t come to give us the sound of the Divine current in us, He came to tell us it existed, but what He came to give is an entirely different thing. He says &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly and the peace I give,&rdquo; the peace, He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;the light I give&rdquo; or &ldquo;the sounds that I give,&rdquo; He said &ldquo;the peace I give the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; Now this is what you discover that if you don&rsquo;t even see a light when you meditate or you don&rsquo;t hear a sound, you automatically receive peace, the mere fact that you&rsquo;re staying in the present and that your mind is not drifting away to something concerning the future or something concerning the past, you automatically receive the peace, the peace that the I AM self, the Christ self, the Divine self is giving to you when you go to it. Now He says &ldquo;When you pray retreat to your innermost chamber.&rdquo; Now some people think an innermost chamber could be the closet you know, well I&rsquo;ve had some wonderful experiences in the toilet too you know (laughter). Many time I&rsquo;ve had some wonderful experiences, the innermost chamber is here, when you pray, when you meditate or when you go in to communicate, retreat / pull back, retreat means to pull back, bring in your consciousness, take it back to the innermost chamber, the point between the eyebrows and knock. Now you don&rsquo;t knock at a window, you knock at a door, you see, He used a specific statement, He says &ldquo;knock&rdquo; that&rsquo;s telling you right away that this portion of the brain functions like a door. Now we have a gland which we call the pituitary gland, and it&rsquo;s supposed to have two flanges, or two lobes, and it functions exactly like a door on a pair of a hinge. Doctors have opened it and examined it and it&rsquo;s exactly what it is, it behaves just like a door. So now Jesus didn&rsquo;t open His brain by surgery, it took science to cut open brains to see, but here is a Master who is seeing this thing within Himself and is giving the statements, giving the truth that eventually we are going to experience and verify what these men are talking about and we&rsquo;re gonna understand it better, why, because we are in the age or the evolution to comprehend what they are talking about. Now He says &ldquo;knock,&rdquo; knocking means you must stay here and direct the mind in the present, I AM, like Jesus said &ldquo;I and My Father are one&rdquo; or &ldquo;beloved Jesus I am here,&rdquo; any thought is like knocking, any idea, any affirmation is like knocking. Eventually it&rsquo;ll open because &ldquo;knock and it shall be opened.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;knock and it&rsquo;ll never be opened,&rdquo; He said &ldquo;knock.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say how long it would take for you to open either, He gave a specific statement what we should do to experience. Now if we get over anxiety as I said before, we start to thinking &ldquo;how long is it going to take the thing to open,&rdquo; you see, your mind shifting away from the present, you&rsquo;re not doing what you&rsquo;re supposed to do, &ldquo;when is it going to open,&rdquo; &ldquo;am I getting results,&rdquo; this is the common &ldquo;knock.&rdquo; When you&rsquo;re at the door someone says &ldquo;knock,&rdquo; well the moment you start thinking &ldquo;are they going to open the door or not,&rdquo; then your mind is drifting away to anxiety, you see, but if you knock and this what the knocking will develop in you, it will develop the strength of humility, the strength of patience. Now this is something you cannot gain from the outside world, nothing in the outside world can produce it, it comes from inside, you see, by your own self acquisition. When you knock, that is sending the mind here all the time with the idea &ldquo;I am He&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father reveal Yourself&rdquo; or &ldquo;beloved Jesus,&rdquo; or any one of the holy men, knocking, it will be opened. Now &ldquo;ask and it shall be given,&rdquo; now He was very specific &ldquo;to knock it open,&rdquo; &ldquo;ask, it shall be given,&rdquo; asking is directing the consciousness to what you need to know about yourself. We don&rsquo;t know ourselves until we knock at the door, until this doors opens, and we ask. Now when we knock, remember I said He told us to look inside and you&rsquo;ll see a light &ldquo;the light is shining in the darkness,&rdquo; the darkness is the door because you close your eyes and you don&rsquo;t see a light right away, there&rsquo;s a haze, a darkness in there and that&rsquo;s like a door, a blind, a screen, and you knock until it separates, it opens and this light comes out. Now we see this light, but there was a difference in the translation because the Greek mentality looked upon the word SUN and thought it meant &ldquo;this is My beloved Son,&rdquo; the personality and then identified it as a offspring of the Creator whereas the Hebrews don&rsquo;t think that way, they think in an abstract way because God is light to them, they always knew God to be light and God was the Divine Consciousness and that every man was a Divine Sun, every man was a reflection of the Divine Light. That&rsquo;s why they said, even Jesus says &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that you are gods?&rdquo; When He was walking on the Earth, He often made this remark, &ldquo;as many as received Him to them gave ye the power to becomes Suns of God,&rdquo; not SON, SUN. This is where the translation has left us all fouled up that when He said &ldquo;this is My beloved Son,&rdquo; right away we begin to conjure up in our mind that here is Jesus, we are very lowly people, there is no opportunity for us to ever raise beyond this level and where He Himself is going to contradict that statement, remember He says &ldquo;not one word of Mine will pass away, though Heaven and Earth will pass away,&rdquo; though many men will try to distort His truth, the real truth cannot pass away because He says &ldquo;the things I do you shall do also and greater things shall you.&rdquo; 2:00 Now if He&rsquo;s the only beloved Son of God, SON, in a personality sense, the last statement would be incorrect, &ldquo;the things I do, you shall do also,&rdquo; but not greater than me? Only a beloved Son or a special Son would have special privileges, right? This is an obvious thing among human beings, it is an obvious thing among a spiritual being, it would be impossible for it to say that He would say and contradict this truth because no Master contradicts truth that &ldquo;the things I do you will do also and greater things shall you do&rdquo; because if He says &ldquo;greater things&rdquo; this is a contradiction of the fact that what they wrote about Him saying &ldquo;this is my beloved Sun in whom I am well pleased&rdquo; beloved means that this is a special one and only, there is no other one in the whole grouping that can fit into this&hellip; Audience: I want to ask a question, but in the sense that His baptism would God have said &ldquo;this is my beloved SUN?&rdquo; I mean this seems like (inaudible). Adano: Well I show you how &ldquo;this is my beloved SUN,&rdquo; &ldquo;this principle of light which I have placed in Man&hellip;&rdquo; (interruption) Sister, you made it back in time! Audience: I knew you were here. Adano: I sent you the thought. Audience: Did I pass or fail the test? Adano: You passed the test. Audience: Good, I figured I passed it. Adano: But this is what the transmission is you see, the transmission is that if you are meditating and you are in attunement or at-one-ment, not Yom Kippur, not atonement it&rsquo;s at-one-ment where you&rsquo;re long lost in this atonement for nothing&hellip; Audience: You want me to tell you how I knew? Adano: She told you? Audience: No, I never got the message. When I woke up Saturday morning I said &ldquo;Vera&rdquo; and you call and ask her if this isn&rsquo;t the truth, put my hand on the bible, because she slept with me Vera, I said &ldquo;Vera, Adano is in town.&rdquo; Last night I was walking and I surprised you and Louis on the astral plane and Louise was doing like this and I said &ldquo;Is Adano in town?&rdquo; And the expression on both of your faces, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; (Laughter) Adano: Well this is why you have to experience it this way you see. You see the disciple, the student, must have the spiritual experience apart from reading, you see real spiritual truth, real religion is not lip service, it is experience. The miracles of Jesus are nothing new, the things He said &ldquo;I do you&rsquo;ll do also and greater things shall you do&rdquo; (inaudible), He did not mean that He was the only beloved S-O-N. The principle was used &ldquo;this is my beloved SUN,&rdquo; this is a stamp, this light is the true light in all Men which must become beloved by man, man must learn to love this light as the Divinity in himself and if he doesn&rsquo;t learn to love it, he has nothing else to love because he will loving a false image, he will love graven images, he will start to make images of the light, you see, &ldquo;and thou shalt have no graven image before Me,&rdquo; this beloved light placed in Man, dormant in Man. You see God slowed down, became Man, and stamped Man like a USDA choice meat, this is US God sanctified, spiritual Man, you see He stamped&hellip; that&rsquo;s why He said &ldquo;beloved,&rdquo; He has stamped the structure with the light, He has stamped it for eternity that we all carrying this Divine principle, this Divine light locked up in us, to this we must turn to, this is where we dedicate and devote our Divine life, our inner love to, this is the beloved light. Now that why Jesus knew it was not meant to say SON, S-O-N, that&rsquo;s why He made an issue with it when He asked Peter &ldquo;who do men say that I am?&rdquo; Not who this body is, He was speaking in a very deep metaphysical way to Peter and he says &ldquo;some people say you are a prophet, some people say so-and-so, but thou art Christ, Son of the Living God.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; in His own words He told Peter &ldquo;I did not say that to you that I am that, the Father which is in you has revealed it,&rdquo; but what has He really revealed to Peter is the question and that is what Jesus is trying to make Peter understand. Now Peter is going to labor under the illusion of not SUN, but SON, but Peter did not labor under the illusion as an SON, it was the translators who labor and made the distortion of the SUN into an SON, Peter experience the inner sun, he saw the inner sun in himself and he saw that this inner sun was already in that man in front of him, two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another again. He saw Divine mathematics right in front of him and he said, &ldquo;Thou art that light because it&rsquo;s in you, it&rsquo;s blazing open, it&rsquo;s wide open in me, I just got a glimpse of what I have been shut out from.&rdquo; You see then he says, &ldquo;Thou art Christ, Son of the Living God.&rdquo; Christ in Greek language meant Christos the anointed one who has attained, there was no human being called Christ, there was a man called Jesus or Issus who attained this realization at that period and was walking the Earth among the Greek / Roman occupation of the Hebrew country and Peter got this glimpse, but He was also so fully awakened in this light that was blazing in Him, this sun, that He said that &ldquo;the things I do you will do also&rdquo; and &ldquo;as many as received,&rdquo; &ldquo;as many as who are willing to turn in,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s what received means, knocking at this door, &ldquo;as many of you who would pull away from the five senses and turn in and look in, to all of you will be given this power to become radiant suns of light,&rdquo; become suns of God. God is pure light, each one of us the moment we turn in, the moment we withdraw from the five senses and the environment and seek the tranquility, seek the light that Moses was talking about burning in here, seek that same light that Jesus talking about in here, the same light that the Oriental mystics are all talking about, seek the same thing, we will all be suns, radiant light. Now the scientist is saying the same thing today, that this brain can generate enough power to light a bulb up so we are talking now of a valid light, not of an S-O-N, it was an S-U-N now being validated in our modern technology that they now realize it was not an S-O-N that was being inferred in this scripture, it was a Divine principle of light that is locked up in Man as the only structure chosen in the entire creation to carry it and this is why today now great scientists are boldly asserting that there is a Divinity, but not something sitting on a throne. There is a Divinity in all life, it&rsquo;s the Supreme Intelligence that organized it and it&rsquo;s stamped in Man as light, as energy, consciousness, they&rsquo;re not longer afraid to admit that but at one time it was considered not to talk of the truth, but they&rsquo;re not talking of religion from a churchanistic standpoint, they&rsquo;re talking of religion as a reality, that all life is religion, you see this is a big difference. All life is religion meaning that all life holds us to a principle, religiare is a Latin word that means bind, to bind, so what are we bound to, what holds us, life a principle which is God that all life holds itself together or binds itself together to a principle. That we cannot separate now science from philosophy and from religion, they are all held together now for the first time by the facts that are inherent in them, there&rsquo;s no difference now, they&rsquo;re only overlapping each other with different terminology, but the principle holds them together, the principle of light and sound and consciousness, this principle holds them together. 2:10 So I was saying to you that unless you have the experience and it&rsquo;s only the experience that vouches for the religion as a tangible experience you see, that you must receive the message because how else would you think this truth that you are studying about yourself, what have you got to compare in the outward world that it&rsquo;s not tangible. It&rsquo;s only by the experience that you know that this experience now is a valid experience and why it is valid and why it has to be valid, we live on a simple planet called the earth, it&rsquo;s only about 8000 miles in diameter and the speed of my thought that is passing out from my mouth in the form of sound is traveling at 186000 miles per second squared and coming back to me and you were just in San Antonio, how far is that here from Dallas? Audience: Four of five hours drive. Adano: So if I think that I am at a certain spot, why should you not pick up the message if you are meditating? Because it is light, I am using the principle of light and you are using the same one principle, two things equal to the same thing. That&rsquo;s why you are able to receive, that&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;As many as received,&rdquo; as many who turned in to the light inside, &ldquo;to them gave ye the power,&rdquo; not He Jesus, this principle here would open that you would begin to see an experience from within yourself what is happening. Now you realize there is no more privacy in spiritual life, everybody is totally exposed before God, he cannot hide. Audience: What a frightful thought. Adano: What a wonderful thought, for the first time you can face your neighbor as yourself, first time you really can love your neighbor as yourself because there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, there is all to gain in the reality of yourself. In the inner self and in the inner experiences, petty ideas and thoughts do not come up which we may build a whole mountain around and think they&rsquo;re evil, in the reality it&rsquo;s not because there is no evil in energy and God is energy already, there is no evil in consciousness because God is consciousness already. That&rsquo;s why in the scriptures it is written, God cannot condemn no man, no man is condemned, no Soul is condemned by God because God is the pure consciousness, the pure energy, that&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;Your sins are forgiven you&rdquo; and the people said this man blasphemed, only the God in heaven can do that, but they did not understand, He knew the principle, they did not know the principle. They were strictly living under the idea that there had to be some absolvement, some atonement from some deity for the misdeeds of their thinking, when He&rsquo;s telling them they are applying the very principles that allow for creation from their own brain that would free them from their problems, that there was nothing there to be afraid of or to regret, they did the best under the conditions they were in. That&rsquo;s why He had to say on the cross, &ldquo;Father forgive them for they know not what they do,&rdquo; what else could He say? Here are people killing the man on the cross and here is the man who realized the truth about these peoples&rsquo; psychological problem, our conflict between the five senses and their spiritual nature, now if He&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t a realized man, if He did not know the truth He could not say to them &ldquo;forgive them for they know not what they&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; He would say &ldquo;blast the hell and send them all to hell,&rdquo; take vengeance with them Lord, vengeance is yours now go ahead shoot them out, well it&rsquo;s not true. When we say &ldquo;vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord&rdquo; it doesn&rsquo;t mean the Creator damns the creation, it means that because the laws of creation are setup that you get back what you sow, this is the vengeance, this is the repercussion, you see. You plant tomatoes, you can&rsquo;t get orange, if so your thoughts are setup, the results are yours, it comes back. Now when a Master says you are free from them, it is only because the Creator has endowed this structure with the absolving principle and two things again equal to one another, if I absolve myself, I am absolving you too, you see. That&rsquo;s why the psychiatrist says you gotta learn to forgive yourself in order to be happy. He cannot forgive you, he will say &ldquo;I forgive you for what you do to the person,&rdquo; but if you don&rsquo;t forgive yourself by yourself, there is not forgiveness really occurring. Each of us must eventually face up that the Divinity in himself is the real absolving principle, this Divine light. Now true meditation you begin to experience one peace, two a consciousness that you are, three a strength to face the environment and not run from it, and fourth is something that is added to you now, something that you didn&rsquo;t have to work for. See you had to work for peace, you had to work for consciousness, and you had to work for strength, but you don&rsquo;t have to work for the miracles because Jesus said, &ldquo;What would it benefit a man to gain them and lose his Soul.&rdquo; That means why struggle to develop miraculous powers and still don&rsquo;t have peace, don&rsquo;t have consciousness, and don&rsquo;t have inner strength, but if you seek the peace, the strength, the inner consciousness, all these things will be added, this is a bonus for your good effort. The Divinity does not want us to make a three ring circus out of Divine laws or we make a havoc out of this universe, that&rsquo;s why we are restricted and the things that the great Masters have done were never done for show, they were done for need. Whenever there was a need it was satisfied, as in the case of (inaudible), whenever there is the need it is always satisfied, but never for show. That is why we realize that God uses a physical mechanism all the time to make us realize we have to be humble, if we don&rsquo;t have this mechanism to work with, we will develop such pride, such ego, before you know it we&rsquo;re walking around like big Julius Caesars calling ourselves God you know, but we aren&rsquo;t the God principle is in us, that&rsquo;s what we have. Finally when you go into meditation I said you see a gold light, a blue light, and a five pointed star descending. Now you don&rsquo;t stop meditating after you see that, remember this is the door, &ldquo;knock it shall be opened, ask it shall be given, freely give as you receive.&rdquo; Now you find out why He said it&rsquo;s better to give than to receive because you are receiving from this higher self all the time, irregardless of if you are aware that you are receiving it, you&rsquo;re receiving it because you have already been stamped by it though you never made the effort to discover it or experience it, but once you begin to go in and you begin to receive this inner peace, this inner consciousness it flows out, that&rsquo;s why you give it back, it&rsquo;s a strange thing, you cannot hold it back. We can try to contain it and we can create enough pain and anxiety to hold onto this inner knowledge and then it comes a time when it bursts itself and overflow like in the 23rd Psalm, &ldquo;My cup runneth over.&rdquo; It cannot stop, it is a consciousness, it&rsquo;s an awareness, it&rsquo;s a total immersion with the Divinity and no book learning gonna bring it to you, you see, this is personal experience living with it. If it was from book learning then certainly you would find it in the books but it&rsquo;s not there, it is when you go in, each one of us would be living the principle for himself, each one of us would experience the principle for himself and it&rsquo;s the experience that you would carry with you all the time because this is the reality. You would always experience the joy, this peace, this inner consciousness and the strength and you will see that the miracles that you read of or heard about will begin to manifest without ever attempting to do them, this is a fact this is very true. Why, because you would be living according to the Divine Will for the first time, Divine Will is that you go in, Divine Will is not that you go out to seek God, it is that you go in to seek God, until we go in to seek the reality of God in ourselves, we are not living by the Divine Will, we are living strictly by the ego, strictly by our own emotion, strictly by environmental indoctrination. 2:20 Now this is a tremendous thing to buck, it&rsquo;s a tremendous thing to break away from because if we are in a certain age bracket and we&rsquo;re forced to go to school, we gotta a heck of a time to get out of it right. When we pass a certain age you don&rsquo;t want it, until we get aches and pains then we go looking for it but there is a reason why you are exposed to it only because deep down you have this (inaudible) this particular level of understanding, not in this present life, in many lives, you have brought this level of understanding already that you can cope with it, the search now goes on from within. You&rsquo;re going in, you&rsquo;re going to realize from here on in it is a journey of joy, it&rsquo;s a journey of self discovery, there is no loss of identity, in fact you&rsquo;re gaining greater and greater understanding of your true identity and you&rsquo;re getting to understand that you&rsquo;re not going to be freed from any responsibility or run away and hide yourself like a&hellip; bury your head in the ground like an ostrich, you&rsquo;re gonna gain strength to handle greater responsibilities. Your nature is going to open up, your consciousness is going to open up, that you can live in the environment for the first time and not be of this environment, torn down in a nervous state, broken up in a nervous state, or developing into nervous tensions, you&rsquo;re going to experience that you can now cope and your occupation or your occupational life, whatever it would be, is not your spiritual life. Your spiritual life is something from within, it&rsquo;s the nature of you, it&rsquo;s the behavior how you live with yourself, &ldquo;skin don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; (Adano kisses his hand) &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; But when you kiss your fellow man, it&rsquo;s yourself you&rsquo;re kissing back, it&rsquo;s the same life that is passing through them is passing through you, you see. They say this is very narcissistic, that is the common terminology, but what is narcissistic in relation to what is reality, you see. Audience: I&rsquo;d rather kiss this. (Laughter). Adano: It&rsquo;s the reality that all is life, you see this is the thing, the whole reality is life. We didn&rsquo;t realize until we come into the experience with the Divine Truth that God is constantly manifesting His love through us, but we are not coping with it because we don&rsquo;t understand it. As we gradually understand it, the journey inside is a beautiful journey and it opens up the possibilities of realizing more and more our true nature. Now I said when you meditate you see a golden light, a blue light, and a five pointed star and you&rsquo;re not looking for the miracles, nevertheless these so-called miracles as they appear on the surface begin to manifest, there are doctors who are experimenting, try to work out the mathematical computations of one of the miracles that you may call telepathy, that is the mere idea that you can send a thought and it can be picked up and two persons can respond in time and space and come together and doctors are trying to figure out if this is true or if it&rsquo;s by chance or whatever the&hellip; Let them experiment, the important thing, experience it. It was good enough in Jesus&rsquo; time, it&rsquo;s still good enough now. So you don&rsquo;t have to worry to experiment, experience, let them do the experiment, let them try to validate it, you as a person experience the thing because we don&rsquo;t have enough time, forty fifty sixty years or eighty years of a human body, how much time have we got. We sleep part of it away, we eat part of it away, we work part of it away, how much have we got left to say that we are giving a portion of it to inner growth and let alone passing on or sharing it with others, there&rsquo;s not that much time. Even Jesus you know, He was twelve years of age and from twelve to thirty no one knew where He went for eighteen long years and in three years time He came back and He was the biggest marvel on the this Earth. He lived from 30-33 His spiritual life in the outward world, in the dramatic way, but the real spiritual life of the man was from 12-30 where He was going into Himself, where He was working upon Himself, where He was discovering Himself. Now our spiritual life is based on the same principle, when we start turning in through meditation, trying to discover this inner peace, this inner consciousness, this inner strength, it will also take a certain amount of time and it takes how many years to make a doctor today now when you go to school, 8-10-12 years? Alright, a spiritual giant it takes many long years of meditation to open these doors of consciousness, it&rsquo;s not something that we look forward in anticipation, here again our minds shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking of the future, it&rsquo;s the present, the moment to moment experience with the Divinity, you see. This moment to moment experience with the Divinity makes for the realized person. Audience: Adano can I ask a question? The ones who receive Cosmic Consciousness (inaudible) have they done the work in other lifetimes? Adano: Yes, they have done it in other lives, Shakespeare and all these, you see Cosmic Consciousness is a culmination of the many levels of your struggle to come up from your basic five senses, your memory functions, your intuitive function to the total memory of who and what you are. See it&rsquo;s a culmination, it&rsquo;s like the cap on a bottle, the bottle is molded up from sand / heat and blown, the drinks are poured into it, but you have to cap it to ship it and it&rsquo;s the cap and the label that makes the thing sales, it&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s inside the container. The end product, this Cosmic Consciousness is what brings forth the man, the man may be of any nationality or any shape or may be a woman, it&rsquo;s what what comes (inaudible), the end product. Audience: Adano well then Phyllis who had this experience in Cosmic Consciousness didn&rsquo;t even know what meditation was but she had it but then she had to come back for an unfulfilled desire for some karmic reason? So she has to go through the workload again just the same as a Master? Adano: Yes, you see a Master or any person getting an experience in Cosmic Consciousness, remember Jesus had exhibited Cosmic Consciousness prior to His initiation by John the Baptist, you see. When He was a young boy and they were playing with clay birds and He took His clay bird while everyone threw it up in the air and it fell down and broke, He took His and threw it up in the air and it flew away. This is an actual truth that occurred in the life of Jesus as a young boy. Audience: This is in the Apocrypha in the Catholic bible&hellip; Adano: It makes no difference where it comes from, the fact exists that if the Master did exist, you know there are lots of people who think He&rsquo;s a figment of imagination drummed up to hold us in a state of psychological imprisonment, that God is dead and all these things, (inaudible), until we have experience by meditation, that&rsquo;s why He says &ldquo;though this whole world around us will crumble with all kind of distortions, not one word will go away.&rdquo; You cannot destroy truth no matter how you try it, there will always be some individual, some nut like me who will sit down and try to experiment with it to find out if it really was so or not. In other words, somebody will take up the challenge and want to find out, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what nationality he is or what sex he is, that drive, that intelligent drive, that principle that is dormant, that is stamped in the consciousness will always come forward to take up the challenge, to take the test, to experiment, to prove &ldquo;were these really truths or were these figments of imagination?&rdquo; It&rsquo;ll always be there, we can&rsquo;t rub it out. Audience: Would you talk about the karma? Adano: The karma, you see karma is only the result of how you think. You see the word karma means action. Now you know we have a beautiful sign that the insurance people put out &ldquo;accidents don&rsquo;t happen, they are caused,&rdquo; you see. Now karma is cause and effect, there is not a single thing happening in this universe, everything has a cause and has an effect. 2:30 Now because things are caused, it can only come into existence through the principle of thinking, it cannot come into effect by accident, there is a higher principle that directs everything into action or cause it to come into existence by the principle of thinking. Now you say &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I say &ldquo;I think&rdquo; but do we really know what thinking is? See this is a question we never really asking ourselves, that&rsquo;s why Jesus had to say it while He was in the body, &ldquo;Father forgive them for they know not what they do.&rdquo; He has to forgive us, we have to be forgiven until we go inside by meditation and discover how the brain thinks, discover how this mechanism thinks, not until that time you see. Before that time we will be always living on the outside, we will think the things that happen to us from the outside, we are the victims of it, you understand, but we are not the victims of the things that happen to us from the outside, we are the responsible agent in a very, very true sense of the word, responsible for the things happening to us from the outside, our own thoughts, because the brain is sending out waves of energy all the time. Now you know there&rsquo;s one particular thing your brain cannot seem to stop doing and that is thinking, hmmm? Funny huh? And yet you don&rsquo;t know what thinking is. Strange how we are caught in a piece of machinery made of flesh, it doesn&rsquo;t want to stop thinking and yet we can&rsquo;t seem to know what thinking is and doctors and scientists are busy making &ldquo;think&rdquo; machines and there are two schools of thought that say that the machine thinks, the machine can outdo the man and some schools of thought says &ldquo;no, it don&rsquo;t think, it imitates what is fed into it,&rdquo; you see. Now in actuality sooner or later the falsity will become the truth and the truth will no longer be realized, we will believe eventually that the machine does think, the machine cannot think. It&rsquo;s an electrical principle setup to move certain units that are imprinted with certain data, the only advantage of it is if you say six and four is ten, a blow on your head and you may say six and three is ten, you understand, but the unit will punch out six and four is ten constantly until something malfunctions in that unit, then it will cease to say six and four is ten, just as you would malfunction if you got a blow on the head saying six and four is ten, but you are not a reliable principle because you are tissue, you see. Your reliability is too flexible or too precarious whereas the machine would be stable because it&rsquo;s a metallic object and there&rsquo;s a certain amount of reliability and solidity that you have a reliability in it and you ascribe qualities to the machine that the machine may not have only because you want to throw off investigating the truth of it yourself. So we will gradually call the machine a thinking machine, but the machine don&rsquo;t think, it&rsquo;s like a typewriter, if you punch A, it comes out A, but did the machine think up A, no you see. The information is fed in and by what is fed and computed there it will come back, but we are saying this thinking mechanism is an entirely different principle. We are the result of thoughts and thoughts are units of energy, it&rsquo;s a peculiar truth but it&rsquo;s a real truth. Now the scriptures said a long time before &ldquo;as a man thinketh in his heart, that is what he is.&rdquo; We want to say now &ldquo;as a man think and eat, that is what he is,&rdquo; &ldquo;as a man think, eat, and do that is what he is,&rdquo; but eat and do still comes from thinking because he has to think what he&rsquo;s gonna eat and he has to think what he&rsquo;s gonna do before he eat and do, you see. Now Sartre came along and says &ldquo;a man exists, therefore he thinks.&rdquo; Well if you think that you exist or you exist therefore you think, this is no proof that one is before the other, it means that within the very existing principle, thinking is a function, thinking is responsible for everything that appears as a solid principle in this universe. Now we could not trigger off this universe in any form without consciousness and consciousness is already thinking, we have to think, we cannot stop thinking. Why we cannot stop thinking? Because thinking is a creative principle and we are a result of a creative principle, therefore we are also creative in nature, our nature is creative, our nature is to produce, our nature is not to be stagnant, no matter how you try you want to prove to yourself&hellip; take those people who say that they will never work, never do anything, they live in a room don&rsquo;t do a single thing, the room all cluttered up with every form of junk, yet their very nature will one day will resent the whole thing, they will sweep the whole place out and clean it up. Why? And then tomorrow you&rsquo;ll get all junk again, but then one day they&rsquo;ll clean it, every so often they will&hellip; because the very nature of themselves forces them to react. So we see even the man who is enslaved by his fellow man, he is thinking of freedom, he&rsquo;s thinking of some way out. No one will remain as an organism confined. Now nature shows you that those who remain confined sooner or later are lost in the track of time, they&rsquo;re no longer there, their whole civilization is gone. Now we have such few people existing, few such tribes exist in Africa where they haven&rsquo;t changed their exterior form of living but their behavior is still the same, they have studied photographs, they have made long-range photographs of a tribe in Africa where they live in trees or in caves and been living for centuries like that. They fish, they hunt, they reproduce, and they have their crafts and what they have observed is that they haven&rsquo;t changed from father to son their skills. All the skills that they have maintained are strictly to survive in that environment, you see. Now their whole world is there yet slowly because of the intermarriage among the tribe and the gradual loss of their reproductive quality, the tribe is shrinking slowly. They themselves are slowly diminishing their existence by the constant intermarriage, they&rsquo;re not adding new blood to their lifestream, they&rsquo;re not changing their natural diet, they&rsquo;ve stuck to it for centuries the same way, even the animals they pursue to eat are slowly diminishing. We see that is what life brings when there is no change, there&rsquo;s a slow, gradual eliminating of the&hellip; Now we&rsquo;re not involved with that because we have outlived that, if we were involved we would be with it. It goes to show you we can only realize what has happened to them from our observation within ourselves that this happens to us too that we are ourselves will slowly disappear if we do not incorporate or adapt. 2:40 This is the marvelous thing about it because we are constantly adapting, constantly changing, constantly grasping for more and more knowledge, our creative nature continues to flow, you see, and the more creative your nature becomes is the more productive the environment profits from it. That&rsquo;s why man is constantly striving to express his creative nature, he cannot stop it, that&rsquo;s why he can&rsquo;t stop thinking and therefore he does not know why he has to think. Now the Sages have said that when you reach the very zenith of your thinking, which they call Zen, the Buddhists call that Zen you know, zenith, they reach the very point of where you don&rsquo;t want to think no more, then enlightenment occurs. En-light-enment, you see light again, a lightening up of your consciousness occurs, you cease to think and you are enlightened, you begin to perceive for the first time outside the range of thinking. Well let me show you an illustration (Adano claps his hands), clapping of two hands you can think that up, your mind is forced to do something now to describe what I&rsquo;m doing, huh? See how frustrating the thing can be? This you know pretty well (Adano claps again), this you can relate to, clapping of two hands, but you can&rsquo;t seem to relate to this, very very frustrating condition. Strange that this particular gesture leaves you in a state of frustration to think up. You have to create now, you see you&rsquo;re forced into a creative principle, you&rsquo;re forced right into the creative principle to describe this action. Some people say that&rsquo;s the clapping of one hand, is it really the clapping of one hand? For every one that would try to describe this, his creative nature would give him an answer to suit the condition, but this is a common agreement (Adano claps his hands), all of us, but this can never be a common agreement you see. There is no way to make this a common, standard thing for everybody, this is why we say &ldquo;thinking can now be suspended.&rdquo; We can only suspend thinking for a certain period, not a whole time, you understand? There&rsquo;s only a certain period where we can suspend the thinking process in ourselves and this is by the meditation because in the meditation when we remain in the present, the I AM, for ever moment we remain there, every moment we identify with Now, we suspend thinking, but if we fluctuate like the two hands, future / past, come in the center it&rsquo;s the I AM and here is the present all the time. This is the past and future, you&rsquo;re fluctuating so you have something to relate in thinking but here in the I AM you suspend. Audience: Are you saying enlightenment comes when you stop thinking? Adano: Yes you have to stop thinking for the enlightenment. See because what you&rsquo;re thinking of all the time is ideas concerning past or future, never ideas concerning present, and the enlightenment is only involved in what you have to solve in the present. Audience: Then if we could call it thinking, if we were thinking of the present, we&rsquo;re not thinking. Adano: Right because we&rsquo;ve reached the point of stillness, tranquility, peace, &ldquo;the peace I give the world don&rsquo;t give.&rdquo; Audience: We&rsquo;ve gone back into the (inaudible). Adano: Right, you see the Buddhists would call it you have arrived at nirvana, you have arrived at the state of absorption. People think nirvana means nothingness you know, that the translation, you have arrived at a nihilistic state, you have arrived at a state of nothing. Not true, you have arrived at the state of absorption because in absorption it&rsquo;s stillness, see the reality my friend. Audience: All these things I can understand, reaching these certain stages&hellip; Adano: How you go into it now through the practice of meditation. Audience: Yes. Adano: And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re coming to and we&rsquo;re going to do some now. First thing in meditation you keep your spine straight because this is a temple, this body, and in every temple there is an altar or a sacred spot. Man has followed what the scriptures said, &ldquo;Build Me a temple that I may dwell in the midst thereof.&rdquo; He took the sacred Soul literally, he went to build big ornate buildings hoping that Divinity is going to dwell inside of it when the Divinity really meant &ldquo;build this&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s said that the body is the temple of the Living God. It&rsquo;s the only temple but the human being did not bother to find out why this was the only living temple, why it was the only temple of the Living God, and why he should build a temple, he thought to go build a physical object. This is already the temple of the Living Principle. Now to build this is to research into it, this is entirely different to building a church outside you know or building a pagoda or something. Here it&rsquo;s already established as a temple, here is the temple, this very mechanism. Now in a temple outside they build four walls, a roof, and they put a sacred spot which they call the altar and on this altar they put candles, flowers, decoration, and they have reverence, very great reverence for that spot, and they put the sacred word there in the form of a scroll or something and then they sit in communion. Now this is not what the great Intelligence intended, this is again building false images before Me, you see. It&rsquo;s still building up objects around the thing, the real thing is this, this is the temple and in the sacred temple, which is the only living one that there is, the only true sacred temple, no other place is truly sacred, it&rsquo;s only sacred in the language because of the association, but in an actual sense, not in a relative sense because the churches are not the sacred temple, the sacred temple, there&rsquo;s only one for each one of us, our own human body. This is a sacred temple, no other place, the only sacred temple. Within this sacred temple there an an altar called the spine because it&rsquo;s centrally located like the altar in a church, and within this spine there are seven centers which we call the endocrine system or its often called in oriental writings the chakras. In the book of Revelation by Saint John it was called the holy candlesticks before the throne of God you see, and there were seven, he said there were seven golden candlesticks before the throne of God. Now remember John was a disciple of Jesus who looked within himself and he was writing Revelation, he was writing what was revealed from within himself so he saw these things within himself. He saw the electrical anatomy of his mechanism for the first time, he saw where the Divine Life was pouring into him which was the throne of God, he saw the various seven centers within his mechanism which were like lights, or vortices of light, but in those days they did not have electricity so he had to relate it to candles, they were light burning lights. Now he said there were seven angels around this which means there are seven levels of consciousness within this mechanism. An angel would be an intelligence and we say there are seven levels of consciousness and each level of consciousness possesses a certain spiritual power, that is the power that these oriental people call the the siddhic force or the extrasensory powers, the powers that are naturally dormant within the mechanism to perform these so called miracles. There are not no miracle, they&rsquo;re just the dormant forces and he said that within this mechanism he was able to see the Alpha and the Omega, the start and the end of the movement of life. Well life doesn’t have an end, what he saw was the flow of life. 2:50 Now those people who have seen on TV, you know in Dr. Cayce used to say &ldquo;Man, Woman, Life, and Death&rdquo; and when they draw life they draw a big figure eight. Now if you look at yourself all your nerves around your spine are shaped like a figure eight this way, they go this way all the time, if God was to go to build your body and put all your nervous system working this way, we would die from the internal hydraulic pressure, we would blow up, the pressure would be so great we would just blow apart, but because everything is flowing from left to right, this is what you learned from basic biology, right, that they work from left to right, marvelous mechanism, figure eight, everything goes this way from left to right and they cross at a particular point just by the solar plexus, solar plexus that some plexus of the brain or center, solar relating to space you see, we&rsquo;re stuck with terms again, there is a miniature universe here, this solar plexus, this force is moving backward and forward inside, going up and down. Now you&rsquo;ll see on some doctors&rsquo; buildings you&rsquo;ll see a big staff, two snakes wrapped around it in a figure eight and the staff is flying, pair of wings, representing the spine and the two snakes representing the two types of nervous systems we have. We have a central nervous system and we have a sympathetic nervous system, these two system function within us. In ancient times, because man did not delve in much vivisection or anatomy, he did not know how to write in scientific terminology what was occurring inside, he had to write in poetical language so he called it the throne of God, golden candlesticks, temple, and angels. In modern day language we know what he&rsquo;s talking about, actually know now from scientific understanding, that he&rsquo;s speaking of a Divine Principle of light that is here all the time in man, stamped by the Divine, that his spinal system is the only creature with a vertebrae that has two central nervous systems that move around and there are seven vortices of energy, called endocrine system, that are constantly pulsating with an intelligence of its own, or levels of consciousness, and each one of endocrine systems do control certain levels of behavior. We know this as an actual fact now and this is setup in an electrical way within us. Now the Sages did not say it was not so, the Sages went on to say &ldquo;yes, it is so,&rdquo; science is only validating it, but Sages have said now and Jesus is saying &ldquo;we go in&rdquo; and we ascend. See like John, he said he had to ascend too by going in so the first thing you do, you sit down, find a comfortable position, keep the spine straight which is the altar, and then you center the mind at the point between the eyebrows. You can shut this off and we&rsquo;ll have a little meditation.</p>

<p>Adano68_11_23_1AllNightQ2RRNW6 - OM chanting and Adano going through the bardos, mentioning various people&rsquo;s names and reciting a prayer with people repeating after him. Also OM Mani Padme Hum. 10 Paramhansa Yogananda performed funerals from Whispers from Eternity and Dr Evans Wentz who spent the last six months of his life at SRF in Encinitas and meditate on Babaji. Babaji is a Living Master, but it is Babaji&rsquo;s will that the teachings spread in this part of the world in a simple, practical way. All the Masters are Sons of God and should act as one great Spiritual body in the same One Light. Meditation is the common bond. Sometimes I can feel at the top of my skull somebody like passing a razor, like a hot current going back and forth and it pulls, but you have to learn to live with it. Right around here is like a clamp. These Masters are talking about some vibration there. It&rsquo;s not a headache. It&rsquo;s the energy accelerating from that part. The peace gets stronger and stronger. Question: Why do the Spiritual books say you should only have one teacher? The one Life Current is what lights the bulbs of individuals. This is the Current that passes from Master to disciple. You will be a Master and your disciple will receive the current passing from you and your Master passes the current from Him to you. When a Master initiates a person, there is an involvement of connecting your Soul with His Soul by an electrical or Divine principle. Thus freeing your from the negative pull in death. At death, the Soul gravitates to the negative pole because this is where everything begins, from the negative pole to the positive pole. That&rsquo;s where Jesus said He descended into Hell first, the negative pole and ascended into Heaven, the positive pole and sat at the right side of the God. Now you think God has a right side and left side if He&rsquo;s consciousness. It&rsquo;s only an indication of the movement of the polarities. A Living Master is important because it helps you connect up to this Life Energy. Being alert, not letting the mind drift away. 20 Adano blesses Prashad. Spiritual advancement is not to be measured by one&rsquo;s display of outward powers, but solely by the depth of his bliss in meditation. You have &ldquo;met the Lama.&rdquo; Ever new Joy is God (quote from Autobiography of a Yogi). The peace holds you and seems to synchronize you inside. Do you feel that inner presence? That nothing is pulling apart, everything has come to rest? This is the depth of the Man&rsquo;s inner development. When He can en-shield you with this collective integration, this synchronization of yourself. This is how much this Man or Person has Cosmic Consciousness. This ability to make you feel an internal integration of your nature. Soul awareness is returning to this reservoir of bliss. You think you&rsquo;ll ever get bored with bliss? Learning to be free FOR activity, creativity, greater participation. We fit into Divine Will because It is already following Its own course. You get the picture now? Jesus said, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; 30 You drink from the cup of bliss of the Master by applying yourself through action and to people and living with people, you use up the force in order to get more. More bliss will come to you through involvement, acting out. This body is like an instrument. You are playing with the instrument of meditation in it to hear this musical feeling and you&rsquo;re in the presence of a Lama or any other person who gives off vibration, they are toning you up, not tuning you up. Meditation is tuning you up, it is scales, it&rsquo;s not the musical piece. We may try to learn a musical piece, we may try to play a musical piece, but if we don&rsquo;t know the right tone, the right accentuation, we will be playing not music, just notes. It&rsquo;s like dry sound, no feeling to it. (Adano demonstrates by hitting on the table with two different tones showing how to bring meditation &ldquo;in tone with him.&rdquo;) Your spiritual bliss accumulated in you don&rsquo;t have enough tone. We don&rsquo;t have the same emotional tone / sweetness.  To develop it more, you need more meditation with application, with the right devotional attitude. God is the Divine Melody, Divine Music. You feel a musical tone in your mechanism in this bliss and you smell a musical tone of the spiritual perfume that goes out. All (musical) marches stimulate the coccygeal center. 40 (Gap in tape). The Master&rsquo;s mind is like writing on water. 50 Adano discusses divorce with a woman. Being divorced we may not be able to function with each other under certain conditions until we find ourselves. Buddha said we might be married to our mother and not even know it. (Gap in tape). Many people are laboring under the impression that we all need to go to India for the Masters, the Masters decided they are going to come to America because this is the new India. Sai Baba once told a woman &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come to India to see me&hellip; Wherever you are I am there already.&rdquo; The more we become prepared to meditate or be receptive, the more you draw these people to you. 1:00 General discussions / chatting during a meal. Tulsi is in Adano&rsquo;s prashad. A king is supposed to represent the people. 1:10 There is a story called &ldquo;The Birds of Paradise&rdquo; which is part of Polynesian folklore. The son of a Chieftain went to Paris for education and came back and a friend of the son, a Frenchman, came back with him. The Kahuna told the Chieftain that pestilence was coming in the form of a stranger. Since he was the friend of the king&rsquo;s son, the kind said he was welcome. The Kahuna said ok, but on one condition, when the wrath of the gods was incurred, the Chieftain&rsquo;s neck was on the block to fulfill the law. The king also has a daughter who was going to be married. Just then the volcano started to erupt. The Kahuna came to the king and said he had to offer sacrifice. The firstborn girl of the king was required as the sacrifice. The mother said, &ldquo;We saw the joy on your face when you came into the world, may we live to see the joy on your face when you leave the world.&rdquo; The king couldn&rsquo;t stop the Kahuna from fulfilling the law. Sacrifice is the absolving principle of all wrongs and all rights. No greater love has the man who lays down his life for his fellow man, voluntarily, not suicide, because it involves reincarnation and resurrection. There&rsquo;s a deeper principle behind it all. They don&rsquo;t recreate no more, they resurrect. Remember what Sita did? She called on the earth to open and to call her back in by her spiritual power. This is what brought the resurrection in her consciousness. Jesus could have escaped. He said, &ldquo;Father remove this cup.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nevertheless not My will, but Thy will be done.&rdquo; He saw what was behind reincarnation. He had to take resurrection. 1:20 The Masters make this same statement. We have a case like that with St. Peter. The Hungarian people did not like him. He was stoned to death and dogs ate his body. His arm was saved and is with the Hungarian Orthodox Church and is not decomposing. Yogananda was the same. He offered the last dinner and threw down the body. Though we live for the glory of God in the personal sense, we have to life for the glory of God in the Cosmic sense. Same with Buddha, He knew the cake was poisoned. His body didn&rsquo;t rot. Story of the Master eating meat and the disciples eating vegetarian. The student challenges the Master that he can eat what the Master can eat. That evening the Master ate the hot charcoal from the blacksmith&rsquo;s forge, but the student could not. Story of the Buddha and the beautiful woman. The Buddha said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch me now. The time will come when you can touch me.&rdquo; Years later the Buddha says that he has to go to a village and see some person. This village is known for its brothel. He sees the doctors coming out and on the floor was a little hulk wrapped up in cloth. A person says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in there holy man, that&rsquo;s a dead person rotting in there with a very communicable disease.&rdquo; They are going to burn the body. Buddha walks over and pulls the cloth apart and embraced the woman like He would embrace His wife and she was instantaneously healed and became His disciple. He brings her back to life using the touch of Divine Love. Gurus really don&rsquo;t suffer. 1:30 Bernadette of Lourdes was suffering from cancer of the bone. No one knew it and everyday she did her work on her knees. Her pain would have killed at least four normal people, but she still worked. Once they reach a certain level of inner exposure, they realize that this mechanism is only serving a temporary purpose for them to work in. A Master, having achieved Cosmic Consciousness, draws to Him the disciple. If the disciple is not going to make it while the Master is in the body, then the Master extends credit from his bank account of life energy to his disciples, a life credit, a cash value in life energy from His bank account for let&rsquo;s say five incarnations. He wipes out their debt for five incarnations. It has to appear on the books that somebody has written off their debts. He is the God Father already, He extending this credit to them. Cancer is the result of a hodgepodge / potpourri of diseases. The woman touching the hem of Jesus&rsquo;s garment. &ldquo;Virtue has left me.&rdquo; Somebody had drawn on His bank account to lend a little more life in the form of health. 1:40 No Master takes away the Karma of the entire universe, it takes away the karmic debt of the initiated disciple. You must be able to sacrifice the ability to sacrifice. To give up the martyrdom consciousness, a form of guilt consciousness, psychological suicide. The real sacrifice comes maybe 24 hours, maybe 10 hours, maybe 8 hours prior to exit from the physical frame, when one realizes there is no other way out besides sacrifice. Ghandi told Martin Luther King, &ldquo;Sacrifice is the ultimate of non-violence.&rdquo; But he couldn&rsquo;t understand why Jesus had to sacrifice, but he knew he was going back to Alabama to be shot. It&rsquo;s easy to throw off a principle by argument, but when you&rsquo;re caught up in the karmic movement, the actual behavioral patterns of life as human beings, you find that sacrifice in its true nature is a trial, a test, that we have to past. Gandhi knew it too before he was shot. He was preparing his papers two days before he died. Why do certain individuals have to die the violent death. There is a natural law behind it. It&rsquo;s violent in the eyes of the public. In the leader&rsquo;s eye it is not violent death. It is death, plain and simple death, the way in which we complete the circle of existence. People can die by each of the five elements. There is a fifth way, the conscious death, the mahasamadhi. The ethic principle of leaving the frame at will, the conscious exit. This is what Babaji and Yogananda have demonstrated. 1:50 Let&rsquo;s see if we can break down sacrifice. Sacri = Sacred termination of the mechanism. Fice = fire. The sacred way of terminating the existence in the body. Life has a period to terminate naturally in any of its physical forms in other to continue in another physical form. The period of life is preset. The form may not recognize the period. When the form is aware of the period of when it has to give up, this is a tremendous release (relief?). Nature knows the right timing for fruits, vegetables, birds, etc. The fruit knows it has reached it purpose now and it has to fall off, wither, etc. and become fertilizer or be eaten. Dr. Bose and his crescograph proves this. Masters have to leave so people do not become too good, too quick. The little bereavement was necessary so people can appreciate what He has done for them. If the Master never kicked off the frame, when are you going to begin to appreciate this Master? All life is death, yet all death is life, then there is no death, but only life. But life is different speeds. The sadness is the bird staying in the cage even when the door is open. Eventually he goes out, starts chirping, and is happy, but before you know it, he doesn&rsquo;t want the food in the cage, he wants the food in the trees but he doesn&rsquo;t know the cat is waiting for him and he becomes a meal for the cat, the Divine Comedy. We are going back into our divine consciousness more and more, our Spiritual h-OM-e, take away the &ldquo;h&rdquo; and the &ldquo;e&rdquo; and you get OM. Adano sings &ldquo;Oh give me an OM&hellip; Adano makes up a song about OM. 2:00 Returning home to the OM, the I Am is OM. Home or OM is the actual principle we came from, the vibratory energy. We are returning Home to the OM, so the I AM is OM. We are returning back to it. The Masters are here to help us go back, Cosmic Nursemaids. Their love is unbelievable. Discussion about cremation vs. burying and Masters. Story about Kabir turning into two bunches of roses, cremated and buried by the Hindus and Muslims. Jesus &ldquo;by the fruits ye shall know them.&rdquo; Fruits being picked too unripe causes health problems. You eat tree ripened fruit and you don&rsquo;t have gas. 2:10 (Gap in tape). When these Masters come through with that heightened awareness, you gonna profit from it more so than those who are actually their disciples because the disciples themselves may not have worked out some of the problems themselves to meditate. They may be away from their own Master and not working out the problem. 2:11 Because you have worked out some of the problems in meditation, you understand, these sessions that we are having in meditation, this will make you more receptive to when other great teachers come through like a Lama, or any Master, Charan Singh, or Kirpal, any one of these men come through. The mere desire to meditate in these mens&rsquo; presence now would be more to your advantage than their own disciples because their own disciples are not working out the problems. They&rsquo;re still involved with the lectures. You see? It&rsquo;s not in the lecture. If it was in the lecture, believe me, all you have to do is turn on the tape recorder and listen to it. Audience: Aren&rsquo;t they teaching them to meditate? Adano: They&rsquo;re telling them to meditate, but they&rsquo;re not working out with them the sessions, the color to help them to comprehend what is going on. See I met a group of Kirpal Singh&rsquo;s disciples in California, and the man went to the extent to buy his own church in order to be his own priest. That&rsquo;s good you know and then he meditate, he has wonderful experiences with his Guru, but then there are problems that come up that he can&rsquo;t solve. The Guru is not there, the letters don&rsquo;t solve it, and in meditation well&hellip; We had lots of sessions in it. Next time I said, &ldquo;next time you see the Master in the flesh, don&rsquo;t go burden Him with questions, sit down and try to tune in and let Him pour His consciousness into you, and you absorb it like a sponge.&rdquo; So the three of them who were the leaders of the group over there and they were fortunate to go back to India to visit with Him and they remembered what I had said and I saw them when they came back. Well, they were different people all together than when they left. You see? When I first met them they were all ego questions and when I came back they had the understanding of what I was trying to show them. This is where it is. You have to sit down and incorporate this thing into yourself. 2:13 That one person who went to say that after being in the presence and realizing what was to be done, there was no need to be in His presence because he&rsquo;s feeling the same thing away from His presence. The whole important thing was how to feel it away from the Master&rsquo;s presence, you see? (Can&rsquo;t be heard) to realize that time and space does not have anything to do with a Master&rsquo;s awareness or presence, it has strictly how you tune in. Audience: Because a Master has omnipresence. Adano: Omnipresence is this principle of speed of light squared. He is that state already, in that flux, you see? Now it&rsquo;s the same way with Charan Singh&rsquo;s disciples. The one boy I met you know, his name Ray. He came to a meeting one night and said that Adano&rsquo;s meditation smelled like perfume. Adano says it is God blessing the guy asking the question. Description of how to tell when I personal is experiencing spiritual energy, samadhi, etc. Eyes are the window of the Soul. Skin are the carpet of the Soul. Breath is the chimney of the Soul. 2:20 Freud thought the greatest principle was the sex principle when it was transmuted, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to transmute it. Then Jung went into the religious experience and called it synchronicity. When the individual achieved a certain internal synchronization, there was a changing of the external texture of the skin. In the Yogis for example. Oriental gods look like a man / woman. The Soul is androgynous, it is bisexual. When it is in a state of synchronization, the skin shows it. You see the total balance of male and female in this picture of Yogananda. Babaji is male, but enigmatic as to what kind of male he is. Jesus is male with the feeling of a woman. Sri Yuketswar is all man. In Babaji you see the infinity of something. In Lahiri you see that he is man that leaves you in a blank. Yogananda has the polarity of both passing through him. Bodies of other spiritual people. Kriyananda has little girl&rsquo;s fingers. We have 13 lotuses in the body, seven are present in spine, two minor ones in the spine, two in the hands, and two in the feet. The more advanced the individual, the more they show up. Remember, a Master is only here to make us conscious of the Master in ourselves. You are marked by the Karma to come in contact withe the Master. 2:30 Darshan is the transfer of life energy, the hand is like a jumper cable in the battery of a car. It is like a pull inside. The holy Darshan is to make you go in more where the peace gets stronger and stronger. Grace is when it comes to you spontaneously. Adano reads from Yogananda, &ldquo;it is the Spirit of God that actively maintains every force and form in the universe&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Immersed in an inward beatitude.&rdquo; Like a spiritual cocaine or gin, but performing work proficiently. We are lifted up despite of ourselves (the negative pull). The peace and the grace that floods you is the most important, even without meditation. You cannot find this in a book. But it can guide you to truth in books. 2:40 Story of Yogananda and the brand new Cadillac. &ldquo;Looking forward to a better model next year&hellip;&rdquo; Most people do not know what the real Yogi is. The true renunciation isn&rsquo;t the material object, it is our desire, involvement, our attitudes toward the thing. Story about Adano learning about a stick shift car.  Story about Yogananda going to college in Serampore, the college was created for Yogananda to be near his Guru. Story about the I-Ching book. 2:50 Somebody in the audience tells the story about the Adano photo on the wall of her office and how people react to it.</p>
<h2 id="1968-november-23---part-2-all-night">1968 November 23 - Part 2 All Night</h2>
<p>Adano68_11_23_2AllNightQ2RRNW6 - This mechanism stands the test of eternity now, life eternal. That is it don&rsquo;t decay, you don&rsquo;t gotta put it like the embalmment of the mummies, like the Egyptians were trying to imitate you know. They were trying to imitate immortal frame you know by embalming it. Now today we are doing like the Egyptians, we are pre-embalming ourselves with preservatives in our food. Before we die, we will be well preserved. We will all be mummified. They don&rsquo;t need to embalm us then, we&rsquo;re all embalmed already. It&rsquo;s again preservation or a form of chemical immortalization, you see, that we are caught up in, but there&rsquo;s a genuine immortality, there&rsquo;s a genuine non-decomposition. It is a genuine realization of this is pure energy or spirit based upon behavior. Now this is pretty hard for man to swallow, that his behavior can be the responsible process of transforming solid matter into something sublime. Yet only because of the behavior does man has a way out in this process, you see? It&rsquo;s the behavior that gives him everything because if you judge the culture of a nation and the level of their evolution by how the people behave in relation to each other and what was their contribution or were their contribution to this culture by the men who left their physical frame as testimony of accomplishment and this what where the challenge &ldquo;to him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; To overcome the decaying condition of the cell. 0:02 Today doctors are struggling hard all over the globe how to stop the aging and the decaying of the cell. Now, the Sages are not saying that they will not discover it, the Sages are not saying that it&rsquo;s not within the realm of possible experience. The Sages are saying by slow methodical experimentation, it will require many many centuries before the final result is found out. Well what becomes of us who are caught up in the stream? Do we have that much life in the physical frame to experience this thing? Now are we to cut ourselves off from society strictly to experience it or are we to realize it from moment to moment that this is a process already built into us? That we can, by the power of consciousness, carry on a self refrigeration of the cells to a point where we can achieve total immortalization of it by non-decomposition and our efforts will show by the result. From the result of that man&rsquo;s physical frame at death, how much effort he put into it, you see? Now this is not a something for nothing universe, it&rsquo;s something for something. You only get what you put into it, but every man either cheats himself by thinking he is gonna get something for nothing. He gotta put the effort. It is a world of action. It&rsquo;s not a renunciation of total disregard for the universe, it&rsquo;s a renunciation with a regard for the universe, you see? It&rsquo;s not a renunciation from society or humanity, it is a renunciation for society and humanity. 0:04 The greater challenge is the greater obstacle. So the greater man is the man who has the most obstacles and the man who has the most obstacles are Saints or, what you call them?, realized men, prophets, spiritual people, or man seeking to discover himself would be the man with the most obstacles. It&rsquo;s not the man with the least obstacles that finds strength, you can&rsquo;t get strength with no obstacles or no resistance, you gain strength, you discover your own strength that is dormant in you by the quantity of obstacles that come along and your attitude and ability to be calm under the obstacle, under the condition, and to cope with it, you discover your real strength. Now this is where the real courage comes from. It don&rsquo;t come from going out and fighting in the battlefield, it comes from accepting your mistakes. That&rsquo;s the only honest thing to do, to say when you made a mistake, &ldquo;Me make a mistake? My fault?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a really hard thing, but when we can admit to it, it&rsquo;s our strength, it&rsquo;s not our weakness. It&rsquo;s the first real strength we&rsquo;ve got because we uncover something that is impeding a flow of love, a flow of communion with this principle. So meditation helps us to commune now by going in. These Teachers or Saints or Prophets point out a specific place in this mechanism, how to communicate, and in the Master Jesus He says, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single.&rdquo; &ldquo;If thine eyes be single,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the focus now for the first time, &ldquo;the whole body is full of light&rdquo; and I said before Einstein helped us to understand that this is light. That this whole physical frame is light, the atomic principle, and Jesus was only putting it in a poetical language. Einstein came along and put it in what we call a modern day scientific language. 0:06 So the principle is still the same, like the ant sharing in the same thing with us. He knows, you see, that he moves to (inaudible). So Jesus was only in His day, was saying it in His language, or symbology. Scientists is saying it in the same thing. Living man who is caught up in the turmoil between the church&rsquo;s information of what the reality is and the scientist&rsquo;s revelation of what the reality is, he&rsquo;s caught up in this conflict which is which. Which is the right&hellip; now if there is no conflict between the two, if there is no conflict between what the great Teachers of Truth have said and what scientists are discovering, if there&rsquo;s no conflict between the two, it&rsquo;s only terminology now. Then the obvious thing is to experience. This is the obvious, it&rsquo;s not a matter of tearing it apart to find out what it is because the tearing apart is left to the scientist to do in the first place and he done proved that there is no conflict. He&rsquo;s proven in his observation that this is what it is. It may be a different terminology, but it is the same thing. We who caught up in the process of living have now to experience this condition for ourselves. So it behooves us now to meditate. So They say, the Saints say, &ldquo;look here and when you look in you will see a light.&rdquo; Now They say that another step further, &ldquo;the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehends it not.&rdquo; Scientist comes along and says, &ldquo;the human brain can light up a 25 watt bulb.&rdquo; The amount of energy that is flowing from the human brain, electrically speaking in a lamp, has the ability to light up a 25 watt bulb. 0:08 Now you know how bright a 25 watt bulb is? You all can plug in a 25 watt bulb and see how much light that will throw. Imagine when you close your eyes that much light can be radiating from inside. Now Jesus said, &ldquo;when thine eyes are single, the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; Now if you weigh 150 pounds and energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared, you know how much light you got in you? You got lots of light, but you&rsquo;re not using the light. So the light is shining in the darkness, that is the darkness of the senses, the inability of the senses to comprehend the light, the inability of the senses to refract the light, the inability of the retina to refract the light that is actually stored up in cells and it&rsquo;s shining in there. That means it&rsquo;s already in a state of luminescence, but the cells are not going to turn it off because that&rsquo;s what keeps the cells alive. It&rsquo;s in a state of electrical flux, but the senses and its chemical ratio is in a state of shutoff. It&rsquo;s like there is a shield over the lens of the eyes based upon involvement, based upon certain sensory conditions. So you look in and the light is there. Now meditation is to look in, to watch, and to listen. Now in fact it&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;re going to prove to yourself what a great Saint once said, &ldquo;the body is full of light.&rdquo; In other words you are going to take Him at His own words. If He did exist or not, it&rsquo;s unimportant. It&rsquo;s the principle that lies now for testing. Some people say He didn&rsquo;t exist, He was a figment of the imagination, that&rsquo;s unimportant. Some people give their life for Him. The important thing is can I, in this physical frame, experience this principle and if it&rsquo;s possible for me to experience this principle then I will try to experience it. 0:10 Now I will not try to hypnotize myself simply because I do not know what it is to hypnotize myself to the thing, I must experience light. Now I cannot imagine the light because I do not know what the light would look like so I have to watch and by watching, we are observing. Now the light is shining in there already so sooner or later it got to open up. By the watching it&rsquo;s forced to open up simply by the law of electromagnetism. If you focus a lens on an object and light is passing through it sooner or later that lens is gonna project the light and perform work. That&rsquo;s how we take a magnifying glass and burn paper. Now the mind is the same thing. If this light is present in this brain and it&rsquo;s already in a state of shining and eyes are told to turn in by a Teacher of Truth, then the eyes are acting as a form of a lens, synchronized for the first time as One to allow it to focus, to flow. Now what is gonna flow? The vital life principle which is the divine (inaudible) or divine law, the divine function, which is passing, for the first time this vital current is gonna pass and become observed. It&rsquo;s gonna be seen for the first time. When it&rsquo;s seen then there is a feeling that occurs, it&rsquo;s the feeling that transcends everything. 0:12 Now if I tell you the feeling you&rsquo;re gonna imagine it. I don&rsquo;t want that, I want you to experience the feeling and then when you experience it then we&rsquo;ll see if the feeling is not a common thing (inaudible) and we&rsquo;ll see if that same feeling was not experienced by the other men ahead of us and if they never made the same mention of that one same feeling and went to the extent to tell the world about that feeling. (Inaudible) so close the eyes but don&rsquo;t fall asleep. Watch at the point between the eyebrows, like you&rsquo;re looking at an inner screen. As you watch, try to listen with your right ear. As I said before the mind has a tendency to drift like a wild horse. Don&rsquo;t let that bother you because a good cowboy if he wants to break in a horse he&rsquo;ll hold on and let the horse work itself out till it stops and then he&rsquo;ll ride the horse, he is master the horse. Equally true in the mind, in meditation. If your mind is fluctuating from past to future then you continue to watch (inaudible) and the mind will stop just for a moment and let you see the light. When you do see the light then try to put your whole attention in the light and that will be &ldquo;your light so shine before men they may see your good works,&rdquo; that is the amount of time you spend to make contact with it, and glorify the Cosmic Principle or God within you. That is meaning the same thing, you&rsquo;ll experience the thing. (Meditation then chanting OM then a long meditation.) 0:24 Slowly open the eyes not completely, partially, feeling the peace. Now slowly close the eyes and feel yourself going deeper in consciousness, feeling your sensitivity and your awareness getting deeper. (Meditation continues.) Slowly open the eyes and don&rsquo;t move, try to hold onto the peace. Let your mind come back to the world around you. Thank you. 0:34 You find that you&rsquo;re getting deeper into meditation now? Audience: Actually I must confess, not, but it&rsquo;s my fault. Audience: I could feel (inaudible) get hot. Adano: Well you see that the body is energy. Now heat displacement is an indication of the thermal action going on through meditation, but when you go in and the mind starts to center upon this light, which is the pure energy, your body starts to go through a process of transmutation. Now you can preserve an object by heating it and end up in the form of a jerky. You ever seen jerky? And it can stay exposed without decomposing. This is tissue that is done by a process of heat. Now you can refrigerate tissue and preserve it and prevent it from decomposition. Now we know this process is going on in the human body in the form of metabolism. Through the process of meditation, this is an internal form of action that goes on and starts the process called regeneration of the cells. That&rsquo;s cutting down or slowing down the aging or decomposition of the cells. So we do feel it in the cells and (inaudible) like an electrical charge moving inside. At the same time, the sensitivity is going out in waves (inaudible) and the sensation or the feeling of peace or tranquility or serenity becomes very strong to the point where you actually become or appear to go to sleep. 0:36 Now in the Garden of Gethsemane when the Master Jesus was meditating with His disciples they all fell asleep and He said, &ldquo;Spirit is willing, but flesh is weak.&rdquo; That is because the consciousness slips back and go into that unconscious state, but if you are aware and you are not asleep, then there is that cooling down system in the cells, the cells start to cool down and then there is the process of regeneration taking place in the mechanism. Audience: This is just heat and not cooling down. Adano: Well it&rsquo;s not your head that&rsquo;s getting hot, it&rsquo;s the feet. Now the human body is shaped like a horseshoe magnet. It is customary when the disciple meets the Guru to touch Him on the feet. This is not so symbolical of bowing down to the human form, Jesus washed the feet of His disciples. This is a magnetic transference by this same thermal action that is going on in the human body in meditation and since the Earth is negative and we are positive when we meditate, we are linked into the action. It is like plugging into that socket the two tips of that plug is gonna be hot. Those two tips are hot because they are making contact inside so when you pull it apart you see an arc, a light. This is exactly occurring in a cellular practice within. Now when you meditate, you are actually linking up with the divine principle God, not a person. Now you are linking up with a divine principle of energy in your cells and that&rsquo;s why Jesus says that your whole body is full of light, but light is experienced not only in radiance and color, but light is experienced as heat and cold. 0:38 Now from the same electrical power you make a refrigerator, same electrical power you can cook. The same process is going on in us, the whole body is going through this process and you begin to experience for the first time this inner heat. Do you feel it now? Audience: Yeah, but it&rsquo;s still warm. I&rsquo;ll be glad when the cooling process goes on. Adano: Well, most people suffer from cold feet. This is a degeneration of the cells. So there&rsquo;s degeneration is cold feet also it is psychological paralysis of wrong thinking. Now when your feet are warm, this is positive thinking and the energy is polarizing itself. Now but don&rsquo;t be a hot head, be a cool, hold your cool, these are all terminologies for physical laws of behavior that are occurring in the slowing down and producing the non-decay of the cells. 0:40 Here in this Autobiography of a Yogi, the great Master once said&hellip; Audience: Adano, you know the book has an index in the back? Adano: Um huh. &ldquo;Kriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen.&rdquo; This is what occurs in meditation. &ldquo;The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers. By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of the tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of the Kriya techniques or a similar one, by which they caused their bodies to materialize and dematerialize at will.&rdquo; But this what occurs in meditation, this whole process is going on here to a point where you have full control over the mechanism. That&rsquo;s why Jesus says, &ldquo;I lay down My life, I pick it up, no one taketh away from Me.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no human being can take away life or consciousness of a Master (inaudible). Once He has mastered this process, He can put down the energy and pick it up because it is now an act of will, it&rsquo;s an act of thinking but this is an experience within ourselves and no amount of lecture can produce this (inaudible) because meditation is Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activity Towards an Intuitive Observation of Oneness of the Noumena, not phenomena (MEDITATION acronym). We&rsquo;re not involved in phenomena. 0:42 Noumena is reality, mind and energy in relationship. Both are in a state of direction pertaining to intuitive functions, functions that are independent of the senses, but when you meditate for awhile and you open your eyes, all around you you can see the light, the atoms moving. They&rsquo;re like little fireflies they&rsquo;re flitting all around. Now when you see it this is not a hallucination, you didn&rsquo;t take no drugs to see it, this is a result of heightened sensitivity within the retina where these chemicals now become sensitive to see and refract light. But the Master says, &ldquo;All the Saints who have passed on this Earth plane, Their immortal body is in this light, but we can see it and that&rsquo;s why Jesus came to his disciples and says, &ldquo;Come feel.&rdquo; This is what you think is an apparition, make sure. Now this is a body that can&rsquo;t go no place, it&rsquo;s here in the cosmos and He made Thomas touch it, He made him feel it that it was flesh and blood body, but it cast no shadow and that this body was capable of consuming food. Now the Master has said that if you are in deep meditation and you have this inner revelation occurring and you see this (inaudible), then to challenge it that it is not a mental hallucination, it&rsquo;s not some kind of an apparition, you meditate until&hellip; He says the first thing you will see is a blue light around it, meditate until you see this and then this Master if He dares materializing in front of you, He will talk to you. Now if He talks to you that is not enough, that is not enough evidence that you not a victim of your own heightened imagination. The evidence must come from something substantial. 0:44 You must go in your refrigerator, take out a piece of food and say, &ldquo;Please Master, eat a piece.&rdquo; Now He will eat a piece if He&rsquo;s a genuine experience and He will leave a piece and that piece will not decompose even if you left it exposed for days after. Then you know within your personal, spiritual growth, you had a tangible contact with a reality that is there all the time and there is such a reality and this reality is God, it is the eternal principle of life itself. Now the Masters are saying this is something we have to accomplish within ourselves. That doesn&rsquo;t say we should shut ourselves off from the world and not feel our duties, take on our duties, daily activities, cleaning and scrubbing and so forth. That&rsquo;s part of the growth you know. His [Paramahansa Yogananda&rsquo;s] Master told him, &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t get drunk&hellip;&rdquo; [with ecstasy] He made him sweep the floor everyday. So he made him conscious of the two forms of existence. Here&rsquo;s a physical 100% outward existence, here&rsquo;s an inward 100% existence, the two things are one. 0:47 (Inaudible conversations, gap in tape) &hellip;a hurricane or a tornado warning, you&rsquo;ll hear it on the radio and they will start making preparation for Paulina to come. The person who is passed out of the frame is traveling in the ether all the time and when the ceremony is being performed the vibrations and the pronunciation of the information is being sent out into the atmosphere, the thought waves are sent out to allow him to pick it up and receive it and he will make the necessary adjustments in his consciousness preparing him to return to the light and not stray in the various levels of attachment. So his mind will stay and the necessary preparations to bring him to the light where he would now reenter into a body form which is more adaptable to his awareness. So that&rsquo;s why they say the ceremony is for helping individuals to higher levels is called the Bardo Ceremony or the seven levels in which the consciousness is traveling through you see or the states of consciousness that are in turmoil. You see there are so many states that come in this consciousness that are in turmoil and they have to pass through these things. It helps them to pass through it and guide them back to the light in order to have a reentry. Audience: (Inaudible) Adano: Yes if you want to get a little sand&hellip; Audience: Alright I have sand, what else do you need, the rose petals? Adano: Yeah and a little incense. Audience: Incense, did you say that you had brought&hellip; Adano: I gave the box to (inaudible) to put in his crypt and we forgot to take it out. Audience: I think I used my last stick&hellip; (inaudible conversations) Adano: &hellip;would like to play Kriyananda&rsquo;s records, that has some vibrations in it. Audience: Which one you want the regular chants or his folk music? Adano: Well, put the folk music on and we&rsquo;ll be alright. Audience: (inaudible conversations, then Kriyananda&rsquo;s music playing, then gap in tape) 0:52 That was Monday, this happened on a Monday. I was supposed to&hellip; the Wednesday I had the accident. Well when I had the accident, and this is a peculiar thing you see, the Monday night after I was initiated and I came back home and then the Tuesday I opened my store, there was this fellow who had a store not too far and he was a very alert man. He walked in and he said to me, &ldquo;Adano&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;What, what?&rdquo; He looked at me and says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about you this morning.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What do you mean something strange?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a radiance, there&rsquo;s a light, there&rsquo;s a peace coming out from you. What did you do last night?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo; And this is a man in his forties you know. He says, &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s something coming out from you.&rdquo; I say &ldquo;Well whatever it is I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; This was a Tuesday then the Wednesday during the day I was talking to my insurance man for my store and everything, I was supposed to sign the papers and I didn&rsquo;t sign the thing, &ldquo;come back Friday and I&rsquo;ll sign it and I&rsquo;ll give you the check for the insurance.&rdquo; Well that evening, you know I always says I&rsquo;d like to get my karma and burn it up as fast as I can and that evening I got my karma, I fell off the building and died a couple of times&hellip; Audience: (inaudible) how could it have been any worse I wonder? Adano: Well you see the thing is when I fell off the building my consciousness flew out of the body, this experience occurred and seeing yourself going through this particular state. All the things start spinning around in the wild and then all of a sudden I heard the voice, this inner consciousness again and I could hear Master too. You see my mind went to the Master, &ldquo;No, go back in the body, you&rsquo;re not complete yet.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t stay out. 0:54 You&rsquo;ll have to go back and finish up some work in the body, but I wasn&rsquo;t coming back in because I refuse to come back in the body, what is it to come back to live? From then on I came back into the body and has always been strictly just to complete this meditation and trying to teach meditation. Well you see when I was teaching meditation the very first time from Yogananda when He asked me to teach, lots of sick people came to me and personally I was never a sick person at that time. How can I convince a person that meditation and these SRF recharging exercises and all these things have any real value to a person who is healthy or to a person who is sick, you understand? You can&rsquo;t really prove anything to a person who is sick unless you&rsquo;ve been really sick. It&rsquo;s all going fine for you to talk, but you&rsquo;ve never been that way so you really don&rsquo;t know. I agree that that&rsquo;s true and there were lots of sick persons. Well I realized why I had to go through all this thing to make sure that I knew what would happen and it happened and I got deeper inside into the thing that was happening and real nature. Then I came back into the body and I realized that this is what meditation was&hellip; When I got healed and came out of the hospital, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything no more with teaching you see. I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with meditation and groups or anything, I just wanted to spend my time with myself because I realized everything that was happening in the hospital with myself, I needed to be just&hellip; 0:56 So a friend of mine had just finished building their brand new home and it was strange how it happened, he used to come to the hospital. The wife was the daughter of Count Delaupener (sp?) who was the descendent of Count Delaupener (sp?) from France, one of the first settlers from France in New France. They called part of Canada New France Quebec and was given a big land grand by Napoleon you know. Napoleon don&rsquo;t know it was a big land grant, it&rsquo;s an X on a big piece of leather map you know and &ldquo;go take that piece of jungle, it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; Boundary lines and (inaudible) and she was married to the first Polish, this is a peculiar thing, pilot that escaped out of Poland when the Germans were capturing Poland. He just graduated from flying school and he stole the first plane out and flew out of the country, got away, and went to South America. From South America he came up through to Canada. Audience: What was his name? Adano: His name was Widowsky (sp?), Captain John Paul Widowsky (sp?). He escaped and I think he had to change his name to be a Canadian because he was out on the Gestapo wanted list and they got married. 0:58 They were both&hellip; it was the funniest thing, her father was a judge in the House of Commons and he was strong Rosicrucian but deeply interested in yoga and he didn&rsquo;t know why. He had joined the Rosicrucians and was studying Rosicrucian studies, but there was always something that told him that yoga was more important and he would always talk to them about metaphysics and Tibet and all these places and he always wanted to go to Tibet. Anyway he died and she came and they built a house and they just finished the house and I was just coming out of the hospital and they were living in the city and this house is in the country. They couldn&rsquo;t go back and forth to the house, why did they have this big house out in the country, nobody living in it, why don&rsquo;t you use this place and recuperate. So I got the key and went out and I stayed there and the funniest thing is, they said &ldquo;you can go skiing.&rdquo; Well I tried to go skiing after breaking my leg and I says, &ldquo;no,&rdquo; that after I skid along the ice I says this is enough, (inaudible) wanted to ski after that. I stayed there for awhile and I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with meditation, but with them we would sit down and meditate for awhile and talk, but I was trying to get out of getting involved in groups. A year or so passed and then Sonny came back. You see Sonny lived in Houston. Sonny did not leave, Sonny was in Canada at the time when I had my accident and it was funny when he came in and he saw me in the hospital you know, because he was supposed to see me that following week and he found out I was in the hospital. Then he visit me and then he told me he and George was going to live in the States and I said &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; wished them good luck and everything and they went, and it was the funniest thing, they came to the States and they went through all to visit SRF and every different places, and they finally came back. 1:00 So the thing that triggered it was all the various groups that they heard in the States at that time in 1955 to 66, visited all these groups, Nikki said, &ldquo;Adano, why don&rsquo;t you come the States? Come back to the States because there are people over there who want and need meditation so badly.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Right now where I want to be is strictly up in those mountains there and meditate by myself and live a peaceful life.&rdquo; Well it kept on, kept on, so one night I&rsquo;m up in the mountains there and the thought came back, &ldquo;The only reason I&rsquo;ll go any place is if the Divine Mother takes me there because from now on I&rsquo;m turning my entire life back to Her.&rdquo; She gave it to me and I was healed, but not in a dramatic way and I says &ldquo;From now on, YOU take over. I have nothing to do with this physical body, not going to provide for it, I&rsquo;m not going to do a single thing, YOU provide for it, YOU want me to go to&hellip; You&rsquo;re getting people to talk to me about meditation, You come and pester me, You take care of it.&rdquo; 1:02 So I was looking for an inspiration, I had to have an inspiration to go back into the meditative life, to help talk of meditation because I reached a point where I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved. I knew what problems were in groups and right then the Bible was there and Sonny walked in and he walked in and he says, &ldquo;Well you coming with me, you coming back to the States?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I need an inspiration.&rdquo; So Sonny, you know practical fellow, &ldquo;You want an inspiration, here is a book, it&rsquo;s called a Bible, find an inspiration.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Ok, if I find an inspiration, I&rsquo;ll live it.&rdquo; So when you hold the book, open it, well you want to talk about an inspiration right on the nose and then God hit you right on the mouth, make you eat your own words back. I opened the book and you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it when I opened it, right where my finger stopped, I opened the book like this, well I had to eat my own words back, &ldquo;He sent them out in pairs to think not&hellip; don&rsquo;t take two staves, two sandals, don&rsquo;t worry what you&rsquo;re going to feel in your purse,&rdquo; you know that section of the&hellip; that was the page I opened right and a big thick Bible and to open the Bible and find a spot that fits and I look at the pairs, here is me and Sonny and the other guy, you know, three people. So I says, &ldquo;Well maybe this is one time you&rsquo;re going to start eating all your words back.&rdquo; So I says, &ldquo;Ok make arrangements, I&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo; So I start getting prepared to leave and come back and it&rsquo;s the funniest thing, this was in 1957, so I kept postponing, it was the funniest thing although I got the inspiration to come back, I kept postponing, something tells me, &ldquo;No, no, no, no&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll meditate and go into this state still feeling like you know&hellip; Strange&hellip; 1:04 So Sonny says, this was in October, he says &ldquo;We should be leaving now because to go back through New York in the wintertime, all over those Appalachian mountains, it&rsquo;s dangerous to drive.&rdquo; Well I never thought of driving across you know so to me in my mind, what is the danger of driving? To him he has been through those mountains a million times in his driving so he knows. Anyway I kept postponing, November came along in Canada, December came along, he&rsquo;s getting very fidgety now. I says, &ldquo;Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll think of it.&rdquo; Last minute, it was the 22nd of December, I said, &ldquo;Ok, we&rsquo;ll leave tomorrow.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I thank you, I&rsquo;m making preparations for the weather now.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s making preparations for the weather, this is jokingly you know. I says, well I said to him you know, &ldquo;You know when you meditate deeply after awhile, the deeper your realization is the greater your effect upon nature.&rdquo; Well it&rsquo;s strictly what Sri Yukteswar once said you know, he said, &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m making preparations for the weather tomorrow.&rdquo; And I looked at him, &ldquo;Well if you want to take this thing as a joke, it could be a joke, but it&rsquo;s a very serious thing.&rdquo; Up to that time we were experiencing four degree temperature and I was shivering every morning not wanting to go to work (inaudible). The next morning it&rsquo;s unbelievable now I tell you we got in the car and we start to travel. The temperature for the first time in the history of Canada at that time of the year is 82 degrees. It&rsquo;s no joke, it&rsquo;s on the record. 1:06 82 degrees and we drove all the way down to the states, we came across, coming through all the states. So I said to him, &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;d like to meditate on Christmas Eve night in tune with the people in SRF.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok, you can meditate, I&rsquo;ll drive.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re driving and we&rsquo;re coming through St. Louis, midnight, this is just on Christmas Eve night midnight, and all these odd things are happening, right by St. Louis coming across the bridge and we got over the bridge at St. Louis and we&rsquo;re traveling and deep in meditation in the car and he&rsquo;s driving, BOOM I hear the car stop. Well I opened my eyes and said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;You see what I saw?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;There was a flash of light like an electrical cord was busted&rdquo; and this was snowing on the way and right across the street and he says, &ldquo;In that light I saw three men in the middle of the road standing up and they were looking at us.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Who were the three men?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well for sure one was Jesus, one was Elijah, and one was Moses. These three men were standing there and looked at us and smiled and walked right across in that light.&rdquo; Sonny is a big husky guy, weighs 200 and some odd pounds, and he&rsquo;s like this, he&rsquo;s trembling and the car is hot and I look at him. You know I&rsquo;m cooking inside this car and he&rsquo;s trembling and so &ldquo;well don&rsquo;t get excited, this is only a spiritual experience (inaudible)&rdquo; and the bliss is strong and then we continue. 1:08 Now we arrived in Houston Texas, can&rsquo;t find a warm spot. Everyplace is cold and he tells me so much about Houston Texas that time of year being so beautiful and warm, here we come and it&rsquo;s already 32 degrees in Texas. So he wants to go to get some sun, relax because the doctors have told him already he has to go away from the cold climate and try to stay in the warm climate because of the bone. &ldquo;So let&rsquo;s go towards Brownsville Texas&rdquo; and this is the funny thing going down the road you know and all of a sudden we see a huge, big white bird comes swooping down right in front of us and nearly knocked this bird, he had to pull up to prevent us hitting the bird and as soon as he pulled up he saw the bird stopped in the middle of the road. Just then we saw a police patrol car flash light coming with the thin red light coming and we thought we&rsquo;d done something wrong, we pull up. &ldquo;Hey where you fellas going, stop where you are, don&rsquo;t go any further, bridge wash out&rdquo; and they were putting up a sign to warn the&hellip; and we look at this thing, here&rsquo;s our car, here&rsquo;s the big white bird and it&rsquo;s right on a piling and when we look back to see the bird how big this bird is, the bird took off, but there was the big river. We&rsquo;re looking at where the bridge was washed out. So we had to take a detour and come up. Well that kind of show me now Divine Intelligence has got to take care now. If She don&rsquo;t take care, nothing is going to take care. So we came back and I realized now how this thing is working for the first time, not to fight it, let it work. In the meantime, I wasn&rsquo;t interested to talk meditation and he says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s to Mexico, Brownsville is too cold.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see Padre Island maybe we can get a couple days of sun.&rdquo; So we drove down to Padre Island even that was cold, it was desolate, nobody there. 1:10 So we decided to go down to Mexico and we drove down early in the morning, six o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;m heading straight to Laredo Texas, you know, to go to Mexico and I&rsquo;m going up to the Mexican Consulate office. One single individual on a motorcycle is coming up, putt, putt, putt, on the streets of&hellip; and this person is coming up the Mexican Consul and it was all surprise to me, it&rsquo;s somebody I know. I just said goodbye to them in Canada in a restaurant. It&rsquo;s a boy who used to play flamenco guitar music. Here he is on his bicycle, motorcycle, I said, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to Mexico.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over too.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;A strange world.&rdquo; (inaudible) &ldquo;You go all over to meet two people in one spot and we only said goodbye a couple days ago.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small world.&rdquo; We started to wonder where are we living. Well, it&rsquo;s the funniest thing, we went over to Mexico and as soon as, this is the funniest thing, as soon as I crossed the bridge from the state of Texas into Mexico, this was the oddest phenomena, I don&rsquo;t know how you want to call it, odd timing or what it is, snow began to fall in Mexico! The immigration officer goes &ldquo;Look at this thing!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo; All of a sudden I says &ldquo;Well, Montezuma has come back&rdquo; and I handed him my papers and I kept on walking and everybody is amazed to see this snow. 1:12 Everybody is running out. They stop what they&rsquo;re doing and they are gonna collect this snow. Well they said, &ldquo;This is the first year of snow in 100 years that had ever fallen in Mexico.&rdquo; In the last 100 years was the last time it ever fell in 1957 and we drove all the way down and it fell all the way up to Laredo, from Laredo to Monterrey, and between Monterrey to Mexico City you could see the truck, they were making snowman and piling it and driving down the road and everybody is shouting and making noise. Here I&rsquo;m coming along and I said to Sonny, &ldquo;Well, Montezuma has returned&rdquo; and the snow is falling. I was joking, but&hellip; Audience: Is that a saying or a legend, it will snow only when Montezuma returns? Adano: Yes, it was supposed to be when Montezuma returns, snow will fall in the hills of Mexico. That is true, I found out after. You see one time, this was when I was living back home in Guiana, an uncle of mine he was interested in Mayan history you know and he had collected&hellip; and he had one little writings from the life of Montezuma. After Montezuma had been betrayed by his people to the Spaniards and then he died, before he died you know, he cursed Mexico and the Spaniards. You know they says, &ldquo;Montezuma&rsquo;s revenge, the Aztec curse?&rdquo; You know? When Montezuma returns the hills of Mexico will be full of snow. In other words, in a warm place he will freeze them all up one way or the other do something. I remember reading the thing, when Montezuma comes back, so I says when the snow falling it flashed right in my mind. Montezuma has returned, jokingly you know. 1:14 Came through Mexico, even then I didn&rsquo;t want to teach meditation, he kept pressing, and then I came back from Mexico, visited the various ruins and came back and strange thing, but I went to visit SRF after you know and I met Sister Daya and they were going to India for the first time and she was very cold to me the first time I met her you know. She was strictly a typical secretary in charge of big organization and &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo; and anyway it was the funniest thing, she knew of me in one way and I asked her for her photograph, I talked to her, then I asked her for her blessing or darshan, but the strangest thing, Kriyananda was present in the room at that time and actually why I went up there was only because of a monk that was living there now was a student that I had started teach meditation way back in Canada had gone to live there and he was the person I really wanted to see and then she came in and then I got her blessing you know from her and Kriyananda was surprise, he said he&rsquo;d never seen Sister do what she did. The whole room seemed like a vacuum and you could hear this vibration so strong going and the peace that flowed out and then we were leaving he says, &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve been here so long and I&rsquo;ve been in Sister&rsquo;s presence and I&rsquo;ve never seen it.&rdquo; The first time he saw something come through her and she was leaving for India. 1:16 Well when I left I said to Sonny, I says, &ldquo;She is a very spiritual person but she hasn&rsquo;t arrived at naturalness.&rdquo; So Sonny says, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Wait till she comes back from India then you&rsquo;ll know what I mean.&rdquo; And she bid me goodbye and she says, &ldquo;I hope to see you when I come back.&rdquo; Years passed and I&rsquo;m coming back through that same area and even then I didn&rsquo;t want to talk of meditation to nobody, coming through back that area and went to visit and I want to see my friend the monk and coming up the stairway there was a woman waiting to be interviewed and we came in the doorway to the receptionist and down that stairway, you know how Mount Washington is built, that stairway coming around the corridor, there she was coming down all dressed in Sari, her Indian clothes for the first time and we saw her but we didn&rsquo;t make no sign to her and she came down and she greeted the person who was waiting for her, they went in and then we asked for the person we wanted to see, this monk, and they told us he&rsquo;d be down, you wait in the library, so we went in the library and waited. All of a sudden the door opened and a head pushed through, peeping you know, and then she said &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; one big hug you know, reunion and the energy come pouring down. Well you saw an entirely different person altogether, we spoke for about half an hour. In the meantime the other guy is stuck somewhere in the building, he&rsquo;s not coming out, and we talk for awhile and everything and then she says, &ldquo;Well I have to be going now and hope you come back.&rdquo; And she left and walked out the door. 1:18 We were charged up so Sonny says, &ldquo;Now I know what you mean by naturalness.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Yep, I got the picture.&rdquo; I say &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s arrived.&rdquo; Then we&rsquo;re waiting and the door opened, the fellow came in and says, &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; And we start talking and we says, &ldquo;We just spoke to Sister Daya.&rdquo; Well his face came long, &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Man I&rsquo;ve been living here so long and I&rsquo;ve only seen Sister Daya twice in my whole life and you people right in. I didn&rsquo;t even know she was back from India.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well you should&rsquo;ve come down earlier.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;You know when you called me on the phone and told me you were coming to see me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;You said you were going to postpone it until one o&rsquo;clock and I told you no, come on now.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Well I went upstairs to take a shower and I went down the corridor to get a shave and I cut my face and I had to go all the way down searching for a styptic you know&rdquo; and he says, &ldquo;Then I came down (inaudible) my little cut.&rdquo; The other thing, he had been shaving so many times, that&rsquo;s the first day he&rsquo;s going to nick his face. I says, &ldquo;Well your nicking your face was my good luck.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Look you people get to meet Sister Daya.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s the way it goes.&rdquo; Anyway we went again back from there to Mexico. I didn&rsquo;t want to meditate, I didn&rsquo;t want to teach meditation, didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with no group and we came back again to the States, we didn&rsquo;t want to get involved, we were looking now for a place to spend time with ourselves to do 40 days and 40 nights fasting. 1:20 Even all that time this consciousness is going on, you know, I&rsquo;m forcing myself not to get involved. I says, &ldquo;I knew Yogananda wrote a book called the Whispers from Eternity and I want to find this place at 29 Palms. At that time I did not know it was in 29 Palms he wrote it, but I know he had a place. So we were searching all around to rent a house to live and meditate for awhile by ourselves in the high desert and we found this house, it was the strangest thing, it was the only house that was owned by some doctor and he gave it to real estate people to rent out and we rented the house for about $60 a month, everything, supplies and everything and we spend the whole month fasting and I would always look up to the mountains and figure, &ldquo;Where can this Master&rsquo;s house be that&hellip;&rdquo; inquire, but somehow I never wanted to teach again meditation and Sonny kept asking me. When I came to Los Angeles afterwards and I ran into some people at the SRF church that started the whole train of events from then on, getting back to talk of meditation. Well they were all students of SRF, they lived so long in the area, but they did not know how to meditate and they attended all the classes and some of them were meditating. As soon as they came away from the place, you know, the Ashram or the church, and they had to work in the world, meditation just went out through the door. 1:22 I said, &ldquo;I used to be an official temple leader,&rdquo; but even then I gave that up so I&rsquo;d have time to myself. I just wanted to meditate, that&rsquo;s all, because this is the whole thing. (Inaudible) Well we got together the disciples, friendly, and meditate and that&rsquo;s how it started the whole train of events till the last time I decided to quit again and in Utah now, it&rsquo;s up in Utah when I had the vision of Jesus saying, &ldquo;Well what are you doing, you stopped teaching meditation?&rdquo; Well that&rsquo;s the last time I says I can quit it, I have to come back and teach it. So I&rsquo;ve been carrying it on from then I guess.  Audience: Lucky for us. I&rsquo;d hate to think what would happen without (inaudible). Adano: You see the thing is this, meditation&hellip; well it&rsquo;s in the process of realizing itself. What time is it? Audience: About a quarter to three. Adano: You&rsquo;ve got the bardo book? You see I was familiar with Gurdjieff&rsquo;s work&hellip; when I read Ouspensky, it was the funniest thing, I read Ouspensky after and I read Ouspensky&rsquo;s work&hellip; I thought you had the one by Leary who had it all laid out, Timothy Leary&rsquo;s psychedelic description of the bardos? This here is alright but you have to dig through all the&hellip; Audience and Adano: Several inaudible conversations regarding the bardo book. 1:31 You see the thing is don&rsquo;t for one moment&hellip; what you are seeing on the inner planes, don&rsquo;t think you&hellip; on the inner planes most people want to think they gotta be ultra beautiful more than what you look here. You see the man is seeing an electrical field. If it is an electrical field, the consciousness is gonna be there, but I have to check that out. I have to see him personally to really say that is or that is not what is happening. He might have seen something and he&rsquo;s trying to bring it to that drawing. Audience: Or what&rsquo;s the alternative? Adano: I have to see him first to (inaudible). This is what it is you know, the deeper levels you go in, the more and more this consciousness comes down. That is what the meditative life, the same way you progressing outwardly, you are progressing inwardly. The outward life is also part of the inward life. So the deeper you go into meditation, the deeper the bliss gets and it is supposed to open up&hellip; Audience: I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping, that&rsquo;s for sure. (More miscellaneous and inaudible conversations.) 1:40 (Adano blesses a St. Christopher&rsquo;s medal) Saint Christopher is one of my favorite saints you know, he saved my life a couple of times. Two days ago he did. I&rsquo;m coming along with the truck, it was foggy two days ago in the morning and all the cars are stopped to permit me to pass and it&rsquo;s foggy so I go into first gear from stop to first and I&rsquo;m just starting to move across the car over the section and a girl came at the speed of 60 miles right in front of me and I stopped just dead and her car didn&rsquo;t stop and I&rsquo;m calm and I saw her go down the road and everybody is looking. She&rsquo;d have been dead. Her face where the front of the truck was, where I was coming, her body was exactly in line dead center of vision. In the fog, because everybody stopped she kept on inside right and shot right across and they had all stopped to give me the right of way and I just start moving off to go across from the opposite side of the street and vroom, I put the brake on in time and I can just see the handle of the door, about that much difference. You know I says, &ldquo;Well thanks, she got lucky this morning&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m lucky this morning too because I know if I hit her smacked in, both of us would be pretty&hellip; she would have been killed. Audience: But how were you helped by this Saint? Adano: Well when I drive, I really don&rsquo;t drive for myself, I always pray to Saint Christopher because he&rsquo;s the traveler, of motion, he&rsquo;s the saint who moves in motion. 1:42 You see Christopher is the traveler&rsquo;s Saint and he&rsquo;s supposed to have walked across the water and carried the baby infant Jesus on his shoulder and he has been blessed as the Saint of the travelers. You always see him with a big stick and he&rsquo;s walking across water, a river that he wanted to cross and he&rsquo;s carrying this baby across. He&rsquo;s supposed to be given the blessing to aid travelers that&rsquo;s why they called him St. Christopher, the traveler&rsquo;s aid or the traveler&rsquo;s Saint so I have a St. Christopher on me. You see when I drive I don&rsquo;t only turn to the Masters, I turn to all the Saints, each one has their own particular purpose. Audience: Where is this Saint right now? Adano: St. Christopher has been dead thousands of years ago. Audience: Well we believe in reincarnation so where is he? Adano: He&rsquo;s on the inner plane, he&rsquo;s a realized man. Well you see apart from that the Masters are protecting too you know, but when I get in the car I always say, &ldquo;Well St. Christopher, you&rsquo;re driving. You are the driver of the car.&rdquo; Audience: I&rsquo;ll do that next time (laughter), see what happens (more laughter). Adano: Well I trust myself too you know. It&rsquo;s better to have a little extra trust from all around you know. 1:45 Audience: Where do you draw the line? Maybe it&rsquo;s a naive question and everybody else knows the answer. Where do you draw the line&hellip; I have certain responsibilities, I have come here and been assigned a task which I&rsquo;m supposed to fulfill. This is one thing and then we say that we submit ourselves to Divine Mother, let Her will be, but a person who is not so developed like you are, a person at a different level can use this as a pretext and sort of fail at his responsibility and this is wrong, you are supposed to do your duty, assigned task. Now where do you draw the line? I don&rsquo;t know, this does bother me at times and maybe I think there are people at a higher level who got bothered like Arjuna, you know &ldquo;What is my duty and what is not.&rdquo; Where am I supposed to do something and take the responsibility? And if I fail I put myself to task and I say Divine Mother is going to do it or take care of it. Adano: Well let me put it this way, Divine Mother is not doing anything for you, you&rsquo;re doing everything for the Divine Mother, but you have to tell yourself that She&rsquo;s doing it for you otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t do it for Her. Audience: What&rsquo;s that, I didn&rsquo;t understand. Adano: You see if you want somebody to do something for you is to tell them not to do it (laughter). Alright then you see that&rsquo;s what Divine Mother&hellip; Ok we realize this so quick, huh. Audience: No what I mean is Adano that this is what has happened in certain instances that under this thing that yes (inaudible) when we are really not at higher level under this pretext sometimes what you call apathy or not doing what you&rsquo;re role is to do and then you are committing the sin of neglecting your duty&hellip; Adano: Wait, this is a fine point in which the Master (inaudible). We are all performing action from a past condition. 1:48 In other words what you are doing right now was already preset to be completed in this (inaudible). See now this karmic action is occurring right now cannot be cashed in right now, immediately, because it has been preset to occur now, you see? So you are living out something that is preset to occur now. Now you cannot evaluate what is happening right now, you have to wait for a month or two months or three months to evaluate what has just happened, you see? So this is a condition that is happening. When you say you are doing your duty and where does the fine line drawn between God doing it for you or you&rsquo;re doing God&rsquo;s will or you&rsquo;re doing your own will or your own responsibility, is the evaluation three months from now when you evaluate over four years of experiences and the odd, as you would say, or the unusual way how these experiences fit themselves and came out in the conditions they came out. You begin to see now from a deeper insight that it is the will of God in motion, but in the meantime while you are involved in it, you may not see that, you may see your personal involvement, your personal need to exert your own will upon it or your own control upon it. So the fine line is only based on evaluation. That&rsquo;s why I say, Divine Mother is really not doing anything for us, we&rsquo;re doing everything for Her, you see? 1:50 But in a sense it&rsquo;s only relative, what is really happening again is this, the will of God is that karma must be completed, this is the will of God because He cannot alter the karma, you see? &ldquo;As you sow that you reap,&rdquo; this is the principle. Now if we think in specific conditions and if we think in the specific involvement of the conditions without understanding that these are only conditions for our behavior, then we automatically suffer guilt in ourselves as not performing in a real way and not doing the utmost and we think we are shirking our duties, but this is not true. You are performing under the best possible conditions afforded you, with the best possible abilities you have available, with the most practical understanding you have at the time. You couldn&rsquo;t have done it any better or any worse. Audience: But supposed I know better than say I do&hellip; Adano: Knowing from within that we can do better and that we should do better has nothing to do with the condition in which you are involved at the moment. Now the reason why we know we should do better and we ought to do better is because more conditions will be afforded for us to demonstrate this creative nature of doing better. Every year we have a new model of the car, the model of the car has not reached perfection because life is continuity and since consciousness is continuity we feel this infinite pull of inadequacy and this is what we call &ldquo;the new model in consciousness,&rdquo; the rebirth of consciousness from moment to moment. 1:52 It&rsquo;s not the rebirth of body that is more important, it&rsquo;s a reconstituting of consciousness from moment to moment of demonstrating the refinement process. So if I feel 10 years ago or 5 years ago conditions that I was involved in and the way I did it and I look back, &ldquo;I could have done better,&rdquo; I realize that I couldn&rsquo;t have done any more or any less, but that was exactly what was supposed to have been done because that&rsquo;s the shape of the piece of the jigsaw puzzle and that was the only way it was gonna fit, you can&rsquo;t fit it any more or less. So it is no tearing down of the mechanism because this is strictly gonna be a sort of a self punishment to constantly tear down the shape of the structure to try to fit it into another shape where it was supposed to be fitted in the first place. If you take a jigsaw puzzle and you got all the pieces cut up in front of you and you start fitting it, you got some people who put them together by shaving the edges to fit it, never allowing for the jigsaw puzzle piece that was the piece that gotta fit there, you know? So some people I&rsquo;ve seen them play, they come out with a jigsaw puzzle, shaved it to fit (laughter). The perfectionist shaving the thing to fit in and it don&rsquo;t really belong there, you see, but (inaudible) because the parts are already preset so. It is a reconciliation with ourcells that, in order to maintain the humility in the mechanism, in order to maintain the grace of God flowing to us, is to accept that what we are doing is being done with the best of our abilities under the conditions we are doing it. 1:54 Now to say we have to do better than that, this is true only because more conditions will be forthcoming to allow us to do it better, you understand? Now you can do something good, but you can do something better, and you can do something at the best, but unless you have these different grades or these three conditions to allow you evaluate the three grades, you don&rsquo;t know which one is good, which one is best, and which one is better because you would have no way to compare. So supposed you do something now and in your mind you think you have done the best at that particular moment you are involved in it and four years from now you say, &ldquo;Gee whiz I did the worst.&rdquo; Because your sense of appreciation, your sense of evaluation, your sense of involvement has grown past that limitation, past that point of understanding to something more now, to more involvement, you start to say, &ldquo;Well I could have done better.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s say in 1943 you did this particular thing a certain way and now this is 1959, this is the way you would do it and you look back, &ldquo;I could have done this at that time in &lsquo;43, better.&rdquo; You start to see all the things you could have done better when it was already finished and done. 1:56 Audience: Yeah but not really. I see when I look back as you are talking about evaluation, that you really are able to evaluate later on you can exactly see where this is the kind of experience I needed and how it has helped me to grow further and you can see the meaning which didn&rsquo;t make any meaning to you at that time you were going through all this, &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo; Adano: Quite true, this is the thing that is conflict with where the will fits in, where is your responsibility, where is Divine responsibility? It can&rsquo;t be assessed in the present moment. It is the Divine Will in the present moment and all the time it is the Divine Will in the present moment and at a future time then you&rsquo;re gonna start to decipher or separate which part of the Divine Moment is really Divine Moment and which part you think you took an active part in it. Then you realize the Guru says, &ldquo;No, God was doing it through you in the first place as inadequate as you think it was inadequate and as perfect as you think it was perfect.&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s how God works, who is doing the whole thing in the first place. Who&rsquo;s He entertaining? Is He entertaining perfection or is He entertaining the interplay of perfection? There&rsquo;s a big difference to say &ldquo;God is entertaining Himself through Man as perfection,&rdquo; than to say &ldquo;God is entertaining Himself through Man as an interplay of perfection.&rdquo; An interplay of perfection would mean there are levels of evaluating perfection, but to interplay, to work through Man as perfection, that means there is no room for any evaluation no more. If you are perfect, you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s imperfect already, and if you&rsquo;re imperfect you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s perfect, you see? So if God is gonna to act through you as perfect, this is restricted, this is limitation. If God is going to act through you as imperfect, this also is the limitation, but if God is gonna act through as an interplay between perfection and imperfection, this is the freedom, this is where the evaluation comes, this is where you observe now why there is no limitation, this is all infinite now, it&rsquo;s all a flux, it&rsquo;s all a flow. The Maharishi would say, &ldquo;We live in a flux between the relative and the absolute,&rdquo; The relative and the absolute, no start no end, so don&rsquo;t put a limitation that it&rsquo;s imperfect, don&rsquo;t put a limitation that it&rsquo;s perfect either, because perfection and imperfection are all dualities, you see? And God&rsquo;s Will and your will is still duality. 1:58 Audience: Yeah if the person can probably eliminate the ego and identify themselves with&hellip; Adano: Right, now why the ego comes in you see it&rsquo;s because of individuality. We have been already trained to stand on our own two feet. Now many of us are not standing on our own two feet, we are standing on our heads (laughter) or we are all sitting down or something or we&rsquo;re all kneeling down, the thing is, the whole thing is Divine Will. When I say Divine Will I don&rsquo;t mean that there is some individual poking us with a pitchfork, moving us forward, no I don&rsquo;t mean that. Divine Will is like a flow that&hellip; you see if you have a pipe here and you have water it has to flow from one point to another point. Now so Divine Will moves everything from negative to positive, it doesn&rsquo;t move everything from positive to negative, it down&rsquo;t work that way because the negative had to be made first before the positive can come into existence. In other words, He had to say to the first two people in the Garden of Eden, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do these things&rdquo; which is negative, in order for them to do it, in order to come to the positive. Audience: He had to have an adversary. Adano: Right, He had to make them move from a negative condition into a positive condition so right away they were going to apply themselves to a negative principle, which is not a bad principle because there&rsquo;s no such thing as a bad principle, it is a principle how motion begins. 2:00 The laws of motion, apart from it being spiritual or non-spiritual or mechanical, the law of motion itself is setup by the Divine Intelligence to move from negative to positive, to bring home the devotee from relativity to absolute, you understand? So Man is already positive in his nature but he doesn&rsquo;t know how to move from positive to positive. If you are positive in nature how can you move from positive to positive, you don&rsquo;t know where the next positive is, you see? Now we say in magnetism &ldquo;unlike things attract each other and like things repel each other,&rdquo; this is magnetism you see, this is the law of magnetism, positive attracts negative and positive repels positive in the actual laws of magnetism. If you have this object here and we take this object and this is a positive end and this is a negative end and let&rsquo;s say this is a positive end and this is a negative end, the moment you bring these two positives they&rsquo;ll be pushing each other apart. Now for them to come together you have to let the negative and the positive come, but in the human being it&rsquo;s reversed. You see in the human being it&rsquo;s different, positive attracts positive, positive and negative repel each other. Only in the human being is the law in reverse, it&rsquo;s not in matter itself you see? So negatively we say we are drawn to people of like mind, of like feeling, in order to be polarized. Now people with unlike minds and unlike feelings depolarize us, demagnetize us. 2:02 So in the Divine Will everything is in this Divine Will to move from negative to positive so because it&rsquo;s moving from negative to positive, it&rsquo;s a fine line of where my responsibility lie, but because you are already thinking in a positive way and trying to take the bull by the horn and run this world by our limited way of thinking, we think that what we are doing is insufficient, we&rsquo;re not doing enough to impress&hellip; who in the first place are we doing to impress? You ask yourself, who are we really trying to impress when we take the bull by the horn or take this world and try to run this thing? We have an obligation to do, but the obligation is strictly involved in behavior. The thing itself, the action itself is universal. Now here&rsquo;s some children and you are the parent, you are liable for these children. Why are you liable? At a certain society, in a certain culture, for a certain age, the liability ends or begins or continues. Now at a certain level it&rsquo;s not a liability because in an Ashram everything is a liability, everything is a responsibility. In an individual&rsquo;s house, not everything is a liability, you&rsquo;re not liable for your neighbor&rsquo;s child, you&rsquo;re not responsible for your neighbor&rsquo;s children unless they hire you as a, what you do call it?&hellip; child watcher&hellip; Audience: Babysitter? Adano: Babysitter, alright. Then you are liable, then you are responsible to that degree, but as far as your neighbor&hellip; 2:04 You wouldn&rsquo;t want to see your neighbor&rsquo;s child run out and get squashed by a car so there is concern, not liability, it&rsquo;s concern. So you&rsquo;re concerned to see that the child stays within the framework of safety, but in a Guru it&rsquo;s a different story. He is already decided to volunteer to carry out the Divine Will of helping the individual to move back from negative to positive. He is already like the garage mechanic who comes with a truck to help you with your stalled car to bridge the two batteries together to hook&rsquo;em up to give you a boost. He&rsquo;s already decided to come along and do it for you, you know? You&rsquo;re stalled in the way you need the help, you&rsquo;re waving your hand and here He comes along and bridges you. He is taking a different responsibility, He volunteered that responsibility. Now He couldn&rsquo;t volunteer that responsibility unless He had mastered the laws of behavior, you see? If He didn&rsquo;t master these laws of behavior He couldn&rsquo;t volunteer to it so there is no taking away from Him. His actions have no tearing down, His actions strictly necessary for the continuity of life, His actions are what you call the Sattvic actions. We have the three Gunas, the three modes of action, the three modes of feeling, the Tamasic, Rajasic, and Sattvic. 2:06 Now Tamasic as far as food is concerned is yesterday&rsquo;s food eat today, already being cooked and eaten today, like cake you know, that&rsquo;s Tamasic. Now Rajasic is highly spiced food cooked now, eaten all up, get belly ache. Sattvic food is pick it off the vine, eat it, use it when you need it. Now that is in relation to&hellip; in mode of action Tamasic would be total indifference, they don&rsquo;t care if the place is falling down, they don&rsquo;t make an effort to do anything. Now Rajasic is &ldquo;well if I do anything, it&rsquo;s only for myself&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s all self centered and Sattvic &ldquo;well I can&rsquo;t do it for myself and I can&rsquo;t do without not doing it, then I have to it for the betterment of the environment,&rdquo; you see? So it&rsquo;s necessary for the continuity of my existence so that is a Sattvic action, it is something that you&rsquo;re gonna do for the continuity of existence that is around you the environment so this is now we call it in a nice terminology, humanitarian, very humanistic, very charitable actions, very spiritual, but it&rsquo;s spiritual already from the start you volunteering to do something. Now also it can be very egotistical by believing to yourself that you can change and busy find ways to change the environment, to improve upon the environment, when you are not improving upon yourself, you see? When you should be improving upon your inner self, the environment is being changed and you&rsquo;re not improving. This again, like Kriyananda says, many of us go out as reformers trying to change society when we really need to change in our own inner consciousness how to be good to ourselves and to our neighbor so this has a problem. 2:08 Now Divine Will again is like the ground, ego will or personal will is like a seed, now if you plant tomatoes you&rsquo;re bound to get corn. So if we perform wrong actions we&rsquo;re bound to get good karma (laughter), right? Since it don&rsquo;t work that way that we know of, ego ain&rsquo;t gonna to bring us anything more than we plant in the thing. If we plant tomatoes, we gotta get tomatoes, if we plant more ego then we get more ego. Divine Will is to make sure that you reap your ego. It makes sure you reap your tomato when you plant your tomato, this is the Divine Will. In other words, you get what you sow in the flow of things. Now to say we are doing Divine Will, we really don&rsquo;t do Divine Will, we fit ourselves into the Divine Will. We don&rsquo;t make the tomato grow, we don&rsquo;t make a thought come into manifestation, a thought comes into manifestation because it is the flow of how thoughts must come into existence, how the action must follow-up, how people respond or react to the thought. We don&rsquo;t make this happen, it&rsquo;s happening for us, you see? So Jesus says, &ldquo;Not my will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; You alone bring into manifestation what is the practical or the necessary conditions for this mechanism to pass through. 2:10 This mechanism is now sacrificed or&hellip; when I say sacrificed I don&rsquo;t mean thrown away, it&rsquo;s being offered up voluntary now to take on the challenge as a seed going in the ground to die and to be germinated and grow up. Now He has to die on a cross to grow up into spiritual manhood, into a new tree, a resurrected tree now, you see? So it is a Divine Will that He voluntarily plant the seed of His body into the truth and reap the thing instead of exerting His own ego against it and not trying to go along. Now we can do this, we don&rsquo;t put the seed in the ground to make it sprout, we exert our ego by taking a bucket full of water we throw the seed inside and let it sprout in the water then when it&rsquo;s sprouted we can take it out and put it in the ground and let it root in the ground. Otherwise if you&rsquo;re throwing it into the ground, the ground itself will take a little longer to sprout it, you see, but we just speed up the sprouting by putting it in water. So we took a hand now, we feel we&rsquo;re that smart, you learned that much now about (inaudible) so we can sprout the thing and cause it to come out quicker. Coming about into sprouting quicker don&rsquo;t alter the fact that this condition of dying and being born again has to occur, you see? If it die in the water by sprouting it or dying in the ground and sprouting it, the time ratio between the two is an ego condition. The time ratio between me doing the thing and God doing the thing is still a time condition. When I do it, it&rsquo;s gotta be done right now, now, now, now, when God do it, maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, but it&rsquo;s not important when God does it or when I do it, it is done. 2:12 See I&rsquo;m in Gretna and I say, &ldquo;Ok I&rsquo;d like to come up here.&rdquo; My ego would drive me (inaudible) fast, you got to get up here, throw an invisible lasso and pull him in, or throw the thing and pull him in. This is ego but if Divine Will is moving, the thought is already planted in consciousness, and to show you why it must be Divine Will when it manifests that every intricate piece of the conditions all fall into place because of the subtle nature, the subtle feelings of the people involved who are going to be affected by this thing when it falls into place, that that thing occurred. Now like this afternoon when Helen was on the phone, see, if all these things are not taken into consideration for each individual, look how many people are automatically reacting, you have to have consideration&hellip; So Divine Will is already taking into consideration all the different repercussions all down the line before one little act comes into manifestation that they say, &ldquo;Well gee whiz, Divine Mother is so good to me.&rdquo; You think of how many times Divine Mother has mathematically satisfied everybody with all these things? So you are in the (inaudible). So to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing my duty and my responsibility&rdquo; is a very good question. Should I sit down and listen to Adano talk and forget my home life, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? This sounds kind of ridiculous after. The guru would say &ldquo;Go home and meditate.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think in the ashram that you sit down at the Master&rsquo;s feet all day and talk to Him, you see? 2:14 The same thing is They make you conscious of a relationship with God and yourself and a consciousness of your obligation to yourself and the duties around you but it&rsquo;s all in balance. Now the ashrams or the satsangas are primarily seminars in this behavior of yourself and God and it is a relationship with a daily organized way of life. If we live in the ashram then food and clothing and housing and some type of physical, manual service is being provided for. So you can pursue the meditative life without living with the fear of the lack of these things, that is the shelter, the clothing, you can&rsquo;t wear more than one suit (inaudible), you can&rsquo;t eat more than one meal (inaudible), but these things are not lacking, it&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Mother Hubbard in her cupboard.&rdquo; You know Mother Hubbard went to her cupboard and she found it all bare and came back and had a bone (laughter). Now you see the thing is this is because in our consciousness if we don&rsquo;t have these things we start to think, &ldquo;Well we got bills to pay (inaudible). We can&rsquo;t meditate.&rdquo; Audience: I was just going to say, what about bills? (Laughter) Adano: Well Sister Daya can answer that pretty well, she said &ldquo;Master we have bills to pay, when are we going to pay it, we need some money&rdquo; and you know Master says, &ldquo;Sister, you&rsquo;ve done exceedingly well with what you&rsquo;ve got, continue as you are.&rdquo; 2:16 So Sister walks away and the bill is not paid but before you know it something comes along, they put on some extra lecture, something to raise funds and the bills are paid. Now in our individual lives it&rsquo;s the same thing. Sri Yukteswar says, &ldquo;Live comfortable within your earnings.&rdquo; In other words don&rsquo;t be too extravagant because the earning power is in relation to the spending power, but then there&rsquo;s a seed power. You can&rsquo;t plant without seed and this is the origin of the insurance, the insurance people were smart when they figure it out. If you can&rsquo;t plant without seed you gotta put away some and if you put away some, you&rsquo;re gonna to pull it out before you use it, so why not sell the people insurance against themselves? So you insure the people. Now one yogi says, &ldquo;The greatest insurance policy is God&rdquo; so he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not building up the insurance houses, I&rsquo;m building up God in myself, this is my insurance policy&rdquo; but then another yogi comes along and says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all good and fine, but if you&rsquo;ve got an organization and you don&rsquo;t want it to burn down so you might as well insure it so it is taken care of.&rdquo; So use every law, use every principle, use the principle of divine insurance by meditation and use the principle of physical insurance by taking care of the thing if these calamities occur. Divine insurance is the forestall it happening, physical insurance is to reimburse you if it did happen. 2:18 And did you see that picture, &ldquo;Lillies of the Valley&rdquo; what did the Mexican man said he was doing when they were building the church? He didn&rsquo;t believe there was a God, but he was busy giving merchandise and service and what is it he said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s buying insurance.&rdquo; Audience: Just in case there is a God (laughter).

<h2 id="1968-november-25---bauereis">1968 November 25 - Bauereis</h2>
<p>Adano68_11_25BauereisQ2RRNW6 - Audience: This will be a talk by Adano Ley, made at the Baureis household in Dallas Texas on November 25, 1968. Thank you. Adano: Inwards is an attitude, it&rsquo;s an attitude of love, feeling, and vigilance, it&rsquo;s not thinking, it&rsquo;s feeling all the time but because the mind has a tendency to drift and there are certain waves that pass through the mind and bring certain ideas, we find that our attention seems to latch onto these ideas and get stuck on the ideas. Now if the idea of the past comes into the mind and the mind is latched onto it, before you know it, by the very nature of the mind it will generate frustration in us. Yet if the mind would drift away from frustration to an idea concerning the future, the mind will automatically generates anxiety around that idea but if the mind would stay in the present now and &ldquo;meekly wait and murmur not&rdquo; in this self observation then the mind will begin to experience peace because the present is peace, it&rsquo;s the gap between frustration and anxiety, between past and future, it is the eternal now where you actually do live. It is the only reality, the past and the future are the relative states association, they are not the reality, the reality is now, half an hour ago is gone in the process anticipation, now is the process of participation, you are in the presence all the time. In this nowness is expansion, it is an internal integration of the three forces within your mechanism: physical, mental, and spiritual, you are Soul and the connection between the Soul to a frame called the body lies in the breath, the incoming and the outgoing breath. This incoming / outgoing function is one of love, devotion, is one of conscious recognition, conscious identity, conscious oneness. To stray from this point of reference from within oneself is to go away from the source of peace and tranquility into the stream of agitation and tension. To withdraw from tension, agitation to the source within is to release the reservoir of peace that passes all understanding. To maintain the peace you will partially open the eyes, not completely, feeling it, savoring it, absorbing ourselves in it, to speed it up we&rsquo;ll close the eyes completely and dive deeper into the source. As we dive deeper into this source therapeutic action has begun, we are refreshed, we are revitalized, we are resensitized. (Meditation). 0:10 (Inaudible) the internal source from within, (inaudible) that internal reservoir, we have to think, we have to desire, therefore we use or utilize willpower to shift from the eternal present to the idea we are desiring. (Meditation). If we are desiring internal peace, then there is no need for personal will, there will be an internal suspension of our own will permeating our entire body. This suspension is the divine will, we have become synchronized with the divine will, we have become united with the divine will, our feeling of oneness is intensified, we share this oneness with everyone in the room from within. In reality we are truly loving our neighbor as ourselves and at the same time we are loving the creative principle God with all our mind, heart, and Soul and the internal experience traveling up the spinal column like a tingling cool/warm sensation is the abundant life that the Master Jesus said, &ldquo;The I AM hath come that we may have life more abundantly,&rdquo; the I AM principle in all of us begins to release the flow, that thrilling blissful flow of life in us, transmuting our cells from the course dross expression to a finer, subtle, expression with a great deal of internal delicacy and tenderness and compassion. (Meditation). Because we are creatures of habit, the mechanism internally is craving activity of some sort. In the present process, the highest activity is to partially open the eyes, not completely, and feel your nature, your existence, your oneness, your universal nature, your universal oneness. Now gradually close the eyes completely and go back into the source of the peace. This is truly being active while inactive from within to the surface of the mechanism, go in and out as many times as you need to to experience the flow from the inner source to the surface of the mechanism. As we become more sensitive and aware of the source of peace within ourselves and is receptive to it and to the luminescence present in the skull or the radiant light and the bliss permeating the body, we discover as we gradually open our eyes an inner strength coming to the surface. 0:20 A regenerative condition taking over the entire body, a recharging of the mechanism, a rejuvenating of the mechanism. No internal craving to wander, to expend and to burn up energy unnecessarily, but to reabsorb that which is dormant within us and allow it to flow (inaudible) for the first time abundantly. Slowly open the eyes completely but don&rsquo;t move, observing the tranquility of the mechanism, observing the non drifting of the mind from the present. Holding on to this feeling in the waking state into the active state, how long it remains with you, that is the measurement of our spirituality. This feeling in the active state is highly magnetic and highly therapeutic. This state, in the active state, it is an internal immunization against tension of the environment but you have to hold on to it. Anytime you find the environment will disrupt this state, you can always close those eyes and go back to the source remembering what Master Jesus saying, &ldquo;Come unto me all that travail and are heavily laden, I&rsquo;ll refresh you.&rdquo; In reality he&rsquo;s referring to the involvement of the senses in the environment in the human being, sensory nature becomes laden down with a cross current of activity and there is traffic jams in the nervous system, there&rsquo;s distortion and tension, conflict again between anxiety and frustration, the whole cycle starts again but we have a way in to the source, we have a way in to the immunization process, you have a way in to the therapeutic process, and we have a way to maintain it in the active living state daily, moment to moment, in the eternal now. Let us dive one more time very deeply within ourselves with the deepest love possible that we can generate for the source for we are the source, Jesus said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one,&rdquo; the source and you are the same, two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another, this is a reality, this is the peace that passes all understanding (inaudible). This source is portable, it can be taken with you anyplace because it is within you. The method of application is universal, a shift in the movement of the eyes, the experience is common to all and also universal. The fruits of the action and the process are peace, extra sensitivity or awareness, strength to face our responsibilities in the active world without being destroyed by the frustration or the anticipation or the tension. 0:30 Slowly open the eyes. Thank you. (End of meditation) Meditation cannot be (inaudible) to get results, it has to be experimented with, it has to be applied moment to moment, that&rsquo;s why Master Jesus said, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; This is active participation of people, it&rsquo;s difficult by yourself alone, you may meditation and then get highly frustrated, disgusted, and chuck the whole thing out but with a few other people there&rsquo;s a balancing out, there&rsquo;s a synchronizing, there&rsquo;s an interplay and an exchange of the various qualities, feelings, and the various levels of awareness in each individual. It has never been taught in the churches because in the first place, it takes a long time to reevaluate ourselves when we live in ideas concerning past and future and when our emotional nature is trapped between frustration and anxiety, to widen the gap between past and future in order to live in the present where there is the only reality existing. Two oppositional states or fluctuations of the mind, but we need them very badly, sometimes they are so important to the growth, this fluctuation, it reduces our ego and makes us humble, without them there is no humility. God has waited for us all billions of years to sit down in this room to meditate, you&rsquo;ve been sitting here in the past couple of hours waiting for Adano to arrive, can you imagine the interplay of tension, anxiety, frustration that&rsquo;s going on in the mechanism, very very simple forces at work. We need that interplay to reevaluate between what is humility, what is tranquility, what is ego, what is tension. If we don&rsquo;t have the opposition, we do not know if our spiritual growth is a strong one or a weak one, then we will live in a false concept that we are very spiritual, in fact we are not until we are tested. So in the spiritual or meditative life, which is the moment to moment realization of ourselves, trial, the opposition, the conditions that challenge us, are all the prerequisites for grading the behaviour of this mechanism without it, there&rsquo;s nothing. The word Sa-tan in Hebrew means adversary, opposition, maya, duality, relativity, these are only names for the intrinsic resistance in nature to test the internal potential of the consciousness, do you see? It&rsquo;s the intrinsic resistance of nature to test the internal potential of consciousness, God, He cannot destroy His opposition, He only used personalities because we are taking Judeo-Christian concepts or Eastern concepts and personalize them because we see ourselves as form, form is important. In actuality there is no form, consciousness has no form, energy has no form, it&rsquo;s all bliss, it&rsquo;s all light, but without the form there is no devotion, there is no compassion, there is no tenderness, equally necessary (inaudible). How can you be endearing to a wife that has no form? We must have form, this is why the two are necessary, the opposition, the importance of it. We are trying in meditation to establish within a mechanism that has been classified by the scriptures as a temple for the living creative force, the body is the temple of the living God, but we need tangible experiments, tangible experience to validate it and the only way we can have this tangible experiment, this tangible experience, is to get involved with it and they used to say &ldquo;skin don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; Well I&rsquo;ll tell you a little story of &ldquo;skin, don&rsquo;t you know me.&rdquo; One time a missionary was traveling through the reservation and it was in the middle of winter and he saw the Indian Chief with only his blanket around his body, standing up and looking down the mountain and the missionary was wrapped up in furs and everything and he said to him &ldquo;Chief, how come you don&rsquo;t feel cold in only a blanket&rdquo; and the Chief looked at him and said, &ldquo;Tell me priest, do you cover your face in the wintertime?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then he pulled his blanket apart, &ldquo;Me all face.&rdquo; 0:40 His philosophy was simple and direct to the point because when we get to ourselves, we cannot escape our bodies, only time we have a temporary relief daily is when we&rsquo;re sound asleep and don&rsquo;t know who we are and when we wake up, &ldquo;Skin, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the same thing, you got to live it all over again, but it&rsquo;s important because this is the instrument to work with. It is a marvelous instrument, I don&rsquo;t think any other form in creation could serve the purpose for God realization. God made Man, or the Man species, in His own image, atomic, and in His own likeness, universal mindedness or total memory, male and female created them, no inequality, we&rsquo;re all equal, and breathed into this Man species the breath of life, and this Man species became living Soul, you don&rsquo;t have Soul. When we live with the concept that we have a Soul, we are searching all over the universe for ourselves. When we realize we are Soul, we wake up with this inner consciousness working for the first time putting us at the right place, at the right time, for the right experience, and right experience don&rsquo;t mean good or bad, right experience necessary for evolution, necessary for self-evaluation, necessary for service, necessary for the continuity of life as a whole, no limitation. That&rsquo;s why Jesus could not be the only son of God, in His own words He proves it, &ldquo;The things I do you shall do also and lesser things shall you do.&rdquo; Not like Me, you can never reach up to My state, did He say that? He said &ldquo;And greater things you shall do&rdquo; proving beyond all doubt, refuting all types of propaganda, that He IS the son of God. The Christ Intelligence is the son of God, but not s-o-n, it&rsquo;s the radiant sun within this mechanism because this whole body is light already, it&rsquo;s a radiant sun we perceive, it&rsquo;s the intuitive self, this is the Christ intelligence. The Master Jesus was a physical form that attained it and Chrystos is a Greek word meaning &ldquo;attained&rdquo; and Kutastha Chaitanya is the Sanskrit word for Christ consciousness or Krishna, Gopal the Krishna, one who has attained and only by religious drawings or paintings can we comprehend why it is an attainment and not a person. In Jewish writings, since they were not a nation of sculptors and artisans, they never portrayed their depth of realization in art, but in writing. Other Oriental nations portrayed the depth of their realization in art and color, so the Krishna or the Christ-self, is painted in blue (Adano laughs) and when you meditate, there is a blue flame burning within your forehead and within it the radiant forms of all the great Sages pass before you in that radiant light. Now &ldquo;As it is in Heaven so it is on Earth,&rdquo; if we are a miniature universe, the outward universe has the same colors, the golden beam that encircles the surface between the earth and the sky where it meets at dawn or sunset, the Holy Spirit or Holy Vibration, the golden ring is right around us here. In the center of that golden ring is blue, opalescent blue, the whole cosmos is blue and within that blue is a silver-like white star or cosmic star, five pointed, pointing downward like a dove in profile. Now anyone passing inwards to that inner radiation or inner light would see the same thing, &ldquo;And this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo; If the I AM principle could not be pleased with Its cosmic light stamped within the brain of the Man species indicating that the intuitive self is the highest principle in the Man species, what other principle would it want to love or would it want the form of the five senses to love, you see? Now Jesus attained this, Jesus had a total awareness of this so uniquely balanced, that&rsquo;s why He said to His fellow man, &ldquo;The things I do, you&rsquo;ll do also, and greater things you shall do.&rdquo; &ldquo;And he that doeth the will of the Father is My brother and My sister,&rdquo; no inequality &ldquo;And he that followeth in My word is my disciple.&rdquo; Now disciples always argue, brothers and sisters in the spirit never argue, two Masters of two different religious cultures meeting, the greatest greeting is &ldquo;Peace, Love.&rdquo; Two disciples of two different Masters meeting, &ldquo;Well my Master said this the other day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh my Master said this the other day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s find out what your Master really means.&rdquo; This is what destroys all of us, we don&rsquo;t have no love, we start comparing what the Master said and what the Master really means. It&rsquo;s what the disciple thinks the Master really said or what the disciple thinks about what the Master said is the problem, but the meditation is the leveling agent for all of us. It will betray the ridiculousness of the disciple and it will expose the reality of the Master. So the Master is not afraid to be exposed so He says, &ldquo;Look inside.&rdquo; All Masters will tell you, this is the only path, don&rsquo;t be afraid to be exposed because it&rsquo;s Me and you the same thing, disciples &ldquo;Oh no, my technique has got to be better than yours. My way of doing it has got to be better than yours.&rdquo; Afraid to be exposed because have they really experienced it? They may have something going for them, but if this something is really genuine we don&rsquo;t know until they are willing to expose themselves. Meditation bridges the gap and the fruit of the meditation from the Master&rsquo;s standpoint is one, it&rsquo;s common, it&rsquo;s universal, from the disciple&rsquo;s standpoint, it&rsquo;s contradiction. The Master&rsquo;s from their standpoint says the fruit of meditation is peace, not that the world can give you by drugs, &ldquo;the peace I give, the world can&rsquo;t give you.&rdquo; Life abundant, sensitivity, what do they want of this physical frame that they cannot give the dead man, They have the power of life over death, strength, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep for me, weep for yourself, I&rsquo;m going to my Calgary now, pick up your cross and carry it yourself, carry your own cross, don&rsquo;t carry mine.&rdquo; They got strength, strength of purpose, strength of character, they got it. The disciple, he doesn&rsquo;t see that, he sees conflict, contradiction, he doesn&rsquo;t see peace, he sees the miracles, he sees the phenomena around the life of the Master, and the first time when the Master&rsquo;s life is threatened in any culture, he&rsquo;s the first one to deny knowing the Master. 0:50 &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you, never heard of you&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find that&rsquo;s true of all of us including myself. This is part of our nature, why? Because it&rsquo;s a process of being involved with the fact or the concept that you have a Soul or you are Soul. If you have a Soul you&rsquo;re going to deny the existence of a Master once His life is threatened because in fact the Master is Soul, He&rsquo;s a living example of soul, and He is aggravating you with all your false beliefs that you have a Soul or that you don&rsquo;t know you are Soul and if you really don&rsquo;t know you are Soul, you&rsquo;re going to deny because he&rsquo;s threatening your very social structure. All the things you&rsquo;ve built your life around, all the language structure, all the social customs, this is threatening it, the authority and this peculiar concept of having a Soul is built upon is being threatened for the first time so the meditation again comes as a leveling agent. When the Master&rsquo;s life is taken away by the rot of the individuals in the environment, then the disciple is despondent, he&rsquo;s despair, &ldquo;I have failed, I&rsquo;m no good.&rdquo; All kind of self-guilt comes in but when that happens we start seeking solitude, to console himself, it&rsquo;s in that moment therapy begins. In that moment, meditation for the first time is occurring, all the other time he was dabbling in it, not knowing where he&rsquo;s going. Now for the first time confirmation of values, understanding the real purpose of a Master&rsquo;s life, he then begins to see himself truly, it&rsquo;s not his body, it&rsquo;s the principle. Master truly was the principle of divinity, &ldquo;Where is my principles? Where am I gathering, where am I going to the source?&rdquo; Is the source, as He pointed it out, inside? Ok, solitude, you know like (inaudible) yogi, sit like a lump for the next 25 years to get the principle. It&rsquo;s very true, but we don&rsquo;t have to sit like a lump to get the principle, the principle is here, the next one, if we don&rsquo;t have the next one, the principle ends because the scriptures say, &ldquo;God breathed into Man the breath of life and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; So if the principle is already there, the practice is here. Now not to hold it in or hold it out, that&rsquo;s not the principle, anyone tells you to hold it in or hold it out don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re talking about. The principle is that we are hooked into this process by an incoming / outgoing flow and the incoming / outgoing flow separates us between past and future, between anxiety and frustration, we stay in the center which is the present, which is the Now, no holding in or holding out of breath, it&rsquo;s a realization between the two states of consciousness afforded by breath to a mechanism that has to breathe to realize it. Now if this breath was not afforded to us as our daily bread, we&rsquo;d be long gone, and as one man says, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t He give us jam and butter too on top of the the bread? Why didn&rsquo;t He give us a little more comprehension in this process when it was being bestowed upon us?&rdquo; He gave us the comprehension, but like a seed, it can&rsquo;t sprout until you do something to it. You can&rsquo;t eat the fruit of the seed until you germinate it and let it grow like a tree and then reap the fruit. The comprehension cannot come out of the mechanism unless we water it by effort and watering a plant is effort, you ain&rsquo;t going no place, you put the water everyday and you have to wait till it grows. This process of meditation is the same thing and you realize why mediation is something you do and can&rsquo;t talk about. Now you should not feel offended if someone says &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wasting your time,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re entitled to say that. The question is in the long run when you have achieved your peace of mind and he is still in his nervous tension and your body is in the process of regenerating and revitalizing and gracefully aging and his is deteriorating and rapidly aging, you have the testimony before your own eyes. Who is the fool, who has been wasting his time? Now one man said, &ldquo;The only reason I meditate is for insurance. If there is a God and when I pass on, then I have everything to reap for my efforts. If there is no God, when I pass on I haven&rsquo;t lost anything because even when I&rsquo;m alive I can a little peace of mind, it makes do difference if I pass on and there&rsquo;s no God, that peace of mind is still mine.&rdquo; See, he acheived peace of mind while he was in the body and so if God was going to give it to him when he died and he didn&rsquo;t meet no God, he didn&rsquo;t lose anything neither.&rdquo; You see but this is no really so, there is God, one good fact that meditation affords us this realization. It&rsquo;s the source that nourishes again, it&rsquo;s the source that let&rsquo;s the consciousness flow out, it&rsquo;s the same source that permits you to feel. If this source is common to all of us then we realize why we can dip into it, a good example is like the current in the walls, there&rsquo;s a 110 to 120 volts coming into this building, that&rsquo;s a common voltage, that is like the vital power that pours into us by the medulla oblongata or the mouth of God in Man and you plug in and you light up one bulb, you plug in and light up your toaster, you plug in and light up your radio, these are all different areas or conditions or units to plug into the source. Now you don&rsquo;t have one type of bulb with one type of wattage in the entire building, that would be pretty unusual for everybody to have 100 watt, 80 watt, 20 watt, 200 watt for different purposes. Wattage in Man is receptivity, degree of karma, degree or capacity to cope, but in Man it is not like the bulb that is fixed, Man has a variable capacity because Man is tissue, elastic in nature, that&rsquo;s the uniqueness of Man species, Man has the vital current pouring into him just like the ant and Man has the same source and common bond with the ant. Now if the Buddha says &ldquo;All creatures are our brothers and sisters,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s only from that common source of the flow of the life, but the ant will demonstrate something that we ourselves are incapable of demonstrating at times. 1:00 You take a grain of sugar, and this I have done, and took a handfull of sand and pour it on the floor and I took the sugar and covered it, and I waited for the first ant came along and watched. For a whole hour that ant bored into that sand and when he left and took off, you know what he was carrying? The grain of sugar not a grain of sand. This is an unusual condition for the ant, it&rsquo;s the same thing applies to us, we don&rsquo;t know if we should give it to a human being and says &ldquo;I put this grain of sugar inside this handful of sand, I want you to find the sugar.&rdquo; With your eyes and with your fingers and with your nose you will not know which one of those grains is sugar, you would have to taste each grain with your tongue to tell you which one is the sugar and the ant will come along and pick up the sugar and go his way but we have another capacity, the ant couldn&rsquo;t make a pair of shoes, you see? That&rsquo;s another capacity or another outlet for this Creative Intelligence, this Creative Power. Now birds fly, human beings don&rsquo;t fly but they have a capacity to make a certain type of machinery to allow them to travel through the air so each one of us in our own capacity or our own wattage, is uniquely designed by the Creative Intelligence to perceive the source and meditation helps us to enhance this capacity, this wattage, it enhances us to be creative in an outward nature, not sitting like a lump in the Himalayas, you know this is not meditation you know, the first man who saw that thought and he saw the people doing that, &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s meditation, a bunch of lazy people.&rdquo; Now real meditation, when you see we sit down, what we&rsquo;ve been doing for a few moments, it&rsquo;s the process, it&rsquo;s the growing of the plant, it&rsquo;s not the fruit, it&rsquo;s not eating it. The eating of fruit, the arrival of the fruit is from here to here to here (Adano sounds far away). Now that&rsquo;s one motion of the result of meditation, no meditation (inaudible). Now picture the same motions with the meditative result or picture the same motions with the mashugana yogi beads made of tranquilizers, every time there is one you stick one in your mouth, this is the process. Meditation is a gathering of the forces within ourselves to enhance our own internal verbal capacity to release certain qualities of our own nature and each one of us possess qualities. That&rsquo;s why the Masters have said, &ldquo;Go in first,&rdquo; before you know the capacity, you will know what the qualities are, you don&rsquo;t know them, because you don&rsquo;t know what you brought with them, you don&rsquo;t know how you developed them, but they are there, they are dormant, until we go in, then these things are added, these things are released. Now a scientist is puzzled by an equation or a problem or some scientific condition, he has to spend hours of pondering to come up with a solution. It is this same so-called pondering which is bordering on the meditative condition. Now no scientist will automatically tell you he set out to find the result of a particular experiment and worked all the way to completion, whenever he got to completion it was an accident, he wasn&rsquo;t looking for it. Everything invention was a result of something else that was not in the process or the chain of events that lead to it, it was something that made him conscious of something else. You know when Edison was trying to make the bulb, you know how many inventions came along before the bulb was ever discovered by Edison? The gramophone or phonograph and many other different things came along all in the chain but the last thing he did arrive there even that was an accident, the filament of the bulb was an accident, you see. So we may set out to go to the goal which is God realization by way of meditation, but end up experiencing peace, sensitivity or consciousness, strength, and the abundant extrasensory forces that flow to us like miracles without even asking, that&rsquo;s like interest on top of your money. We don&rsquo;t ask for those things because what does it benefit a man &ldquo;to gain the world and lose his Soul?&rdquo; The idea is that we are going God-ward, that we are going inwards to a state of awareness of the source and how the source functions, that the source would place us by its own intricate way, highly mathematical, at the right time, the right place, for the right experience, Divine Will, &ldquo;not my will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; Even He knew to the last moment, so he says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep for Me, weep for yourselves, I am following the Divine Will already.&rdquo; Now He said, &ldquo;Father remove this cup,&rdquo; He was meditating too in the Garden of Gethsemane, He saw the conflict between what is the forthcoming way of death, or the forthcoming problem, he says &ldquo;Father remove this cup,&rdquo; but then He corrected Himself because that was ego talking and in the meditative revelation or vision, He saw a higher principle, &ldquo;Not my will but Thy will be done.&rdquo; If He imposed His will to have the tragedy, or the forthcoming problem removed by His extrasensory development and blocking it out by escaping from it, sooner or later He would have to face it, it would be an unfulfilled problem, therefore it would incur repetition, doing it all over again, which you call reincarnating, but if you face it, it&rsquo;s liberation which led to resurrection, freedom for the first time. You see freedom lies in involvement and not from running, repetition or being faced with the problem again, lies in avoidance, you got to eat your own words. You say &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do this&rdquo; and the next day you&rsquo;re doing it, well this is true (inaudible) and meditation is this attitude of going in to establish. The key lies in the eyes, eyes are the windows of the Soul, whoever said it poetically was also experiencing something scientific. Every attempt of science to validate this principle has been proven, it&rsquo;s already there and you&rsquo;ll always see pictures of the realized people, their eyes are like this, turned in to the point between the eyebrows, seeing the focus &ldquo;When thine eyes are single,&rdquo; focused, &ldquo;the body is full of light.&rdquo; You see a big halo around their head, but it&rsquo;s a physical process and can be experienced by moment-to-moment involvement. Any questions? 1:10 Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Samson was a man who had his eyes wide open until it got so involved that he had to be blinded, but before he was blinded he said, &ldquo;Lord I thank you for restoring my inner sight which I had lost.&rdquo; So the blind is not blind, the blind sees in a different realm but they sometimes are closer to the inner light than we are with our eyes wide open. You see that inner light becomes obvious to them in there and you find there is a serenity around a blind person all the time, you wonder why because they should be the person most aggravated because of their lack of sight. It&rsquo;s not so, you watch the expression of the blind, do not have compassion for the blind, the blind has more compassion for you who think you are seeing because they are experiencing something inside. I&rsquo;ve talked with the blind and they are so close to inner realization more than those who are wide awake and have their sight. They talk of experiences that occur inside and they are fortunate to see outside to disturb this realization that is going on inside. Sometimes blindness is the only karma left for man to renounce the environment so he can go inside and on the inner plane the realized man, these two physical eyes are turned down and this one here is opened up. Therefore paintings as I said, oriental art, show you certain things, you&rsquo;ll always see the painting of the Buddhas or the Saints, these two turned down and the one here seems to be open. That is because they have shut out the association with the five sense realm and centralized with the internal realm. Now some people, their karma or their thought patterns, since they did not want to face certain things about themselves would shut it out and you notice this psychosomatic principle in young people, afraid to face certain things so they shut out by trying and sooner or later they get weak eyes and they appear to apparent blindness and all type of eye problems and all type of psychiatric problems out of it. Eyes tell us a great deal, they may experience something inside here and because they are trying to express themselves and their very nature is so sensitive and they are not able to communicate and be accepted by others, then they shut it out. They rather shut out the world to maintain what little sanity they think is in there and the world is cruel too and children are cruel. You wanna see why? What is play to a child is death to frogs. There&rsquo;s a stone and that&rsquo;s a frog, there&rsquo;s a five year old kid, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see if you can hit him on the head.&rdquo; Now one child sees another one and he doesn&rsquo;t walk past without pushing him. These are actions and one don&rsquo;t want to be with the group and shuts himself out, he plays and gets into a catatonic state because he&rsquo;s involved and sometimes there are certain things he sees in himself and he wants to tell it to his parents, the parents think there&rsquo;s something wrong and then he shuts out the parents sooner or later, he becomes the apparent retardedness. It&rsquo;s happening inside, get him in the presence of one who is working from the inner plane and that&rsquo;s why they send them to the ashrams or the Guru&rsquo;s or spiritual teachers or disciples and we try to pull them out now, not changing their mechanism in no form but allowing them to meditate, to get stronger from inside, now to face, not to run away, to face the problems with the inner strength for the first time and then come out and then the parent will see for himself or herself, did the child benefit? We can approach it also by psychological methods, by different techniques of diverting his attention, but that can be very costly. The only cheap method we know of that don&rsquo;t cost no money is meditation and children are more adept at meditation than grownups. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;Suffer not the little children that come unto Me, except you be like one of them, thou canst not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; They are closer to this inner light, they are not cluttered up with what we call &ldquo;language symbols&rdquo; yet. Therefore the free flow of the mind is working through them and meditation becomes easier for them, but because they are not understood and because we don&rsquo;t understand it ourselves, this is a pretty new worldwide research into ourselves. At one time it was an exclusive group hiding away in the Himalayas like the mashugana yogi and now He&rsquo;s making it available to everybody with the Beatles and all type of paraphernalia to make us aware that we must look into ourselves. So we are going to appreciate the conditions more of what has happened and in the blind you will see now what a blind man can do. Now Helen Keller was a good example, yet if you ever met Helen Keller&rsquo;s teacher you wouldn&rsquo;t like to be around her. Did you ever see the picture about Helen Keller? The teacher appeared to be the most cruel individual yet she was the most important teacher to Helen Keller. If the blind has shut himself out for certain reasons and those reasons are like walls, they are like crusts, they are like barnacles on the inner sensitivity because this inner sensitivity is so fragile. It is the only anchorage, the only security that the inner person has to hold on to for their sanity, they don&rsquo;t want to give up, they don&rsquo;t want to come out, they are like the unhatched chicken, he&rsquo;s born inside the shell but he don&rsquo;t want to come out, the light is too strong for him, but he needs this outward pressure to force him out, but it must be done with love and yet disciple and yet with frankness and honesty and candor. So then he&rsquo;ll see that the person who is prompting him to come out has his welfare at heart so the blind now moves from the blind state. Now physiologically if he can&rsquo;t see, that&rsquo;s a different story, but if this is a psychological blindness and we&rsquo;ve had an instance like that in an American composer, his name was WC Handy, the man who wrote the St. Louis Blues. He lost his sight because he playing blues and his father was a minister and his father wanted him to be a good son to follow the church and become a minister and play church music, but when he got blind where did go? In his father&rsquo;s church to sing hymns and compose &ldquo;When the Saints Come Marching In&rdquo; and all these different things, but he got his sight back and when he got his sight back you know what he told his dad? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m laying up treasures in heaven but how about some on Earth right now?&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t that we should not try to utilize what we&rsquo;ve got you see, he got his sight back, but that was psychological, It became psychological when his father did not want him to play this music and wanted him to be a church boy and play church music so he built up such internal resentment to the harping of his father&rsquo;s words and that tone of voice of a parent can get to the point to be very hypnotic. When you listen to your voice scolding or discipline in the child, you are not listening to yourself, you have in your mind to tell them what you want to tell them, he has to listen or she gotta listen to you. He should walk around with a tape recorder and hear yourself say &ldquo;mommy this is what you said to me.&rdquo; After a year or two you wouldn&rsquo;t want to talk that way, even if you&rsquo;re doing the best discipline possible, the tone of voice is disturbing the mechanism of the child. Therefore meditation helps us to discover these things about ourselves and the child or the person who is blind can come back out and they will tell you many things about themselves inside of this inner life that they see. 1:20 Audience: Adano last night after almost everyone left, I didn&rsquo;t hear what you were discussing but it was very interesting about getting rid of the ego and you were discussing the difference between psychic development and the psyche that comes as a byproduct of spiritual development. I wonder if you care to elaborate on any of those (inaudible). Adano: Yes, alright, we have a natural tendency to want to help our fellow man in his distress. Now why this is so is because we are our brother&rsquo;s keeper but we don&rsquo;t know how to apply it correctly yet, you see even in Cain and Abel, &ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; but we are. In this sense we share life from within as a common bond so when a person is ill, no matter if it&rsquo;s your own child or someone else, the illness diminishes you in some way because the vital power is not functioning correctly and in your children is an extension of you no matter if they are cut from the umbilical cord from you, they feel, and other human beings are an extension of you too by consciousness and by life principle. So we feel a sympathetic bond for others, we feel a compassionate bond for others, we want to heal them, we want to do our best to get them well. The Masters have said, &ldquo;Not until the time comes from within should we heal or do anything for them.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why an example of this was when His mother, Jesus&rsquo; mother, came to Him at the very first time He came down from the mountain of meditating and He was at a wedding, she came to Him and says &ldquo;Son, there is no wine&rdquo; and He said, &ldquo;Woman, what is that to Me? My time has not yet come.&rdquo; Well this sound kind of alien to a Jewish home because I&rsquo;ve been around them and I know the humor and the way they talk to each other, this is highly unfamiliar with a mother and a son talking, it couldn&rsquo;t be that way, they don&rsquo;t have the feeling or relationship. What would be more familiar is if her son was named Abe, &ldquo;Abe my boy, we got no more wine and this is your cousin and the wedding is going on and we got to make merry.&rdquo; This would be more familiar, this would be more of the nature of a mother to a son. &ldquo;Momma, momma, that&rsquo;s not my responsibility.&rdquo; This would be the normal reaction and I&rsquo;ve seen in among non-Jew as well as Jew, but this is happening in the Jewish frame of reference so &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my responsibility.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not going to say &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; whack, whack across your mouth, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my son the doctor,&rdquo; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my son the prophet,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re proud of it. He&rsquo;s never going to say &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s ridiculous, but the point is the endearment between the two by saying &ldquo;My time has not yet come&rdquo; is to point out that although she knew He had this ability, all these qualities, and He Himself knew, He did not want to get His ego in the way, you see? We can apply this principle of healing or doing these psychic energies that are a result of meditation, we can apply them in an egotistical way or we can apply it by Divine Will. If we apply it in an egotistical way then we haven&rsquo;t developed a high level of morality yet, we haven&rsquo;t reached the state of realization yet, but if we are applying it in Divine Will&rsquo;s way, we have achieved the realization and the Divine Will works through us and tells us from inside &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their turn to be healed, go ahead&rdquo; and before you even say &ldquo;you gonna be healed&rdquo; the internal self says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m healing him already so don&rsquo;t say nothing.&rdquo; So &ldquo;I am My Father are one, I don&rsquo;t do anything, the Father doeth everything.&rdquo; This is a confirmation of the fact that &ldquo;My time has not yet come.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t go out and teach this knowledge or make confirmation of a knowledge when the thing was not flowing, He didn&rsquo;t get the green light to go ahead, you see He was standing at the red light of consciousness waiting with all the forces behind Him, the whole knapsack like Santa Claus, waiting for the red light to come down the chimney. This relationship is going on, it&rsquo;s a subtle form of behavior that is very important in trying to help and how to get this thing to go. Now when he taught His disciples and told the world that they can heal or do these things, He made a point of saying, &ldquo;If you have faith in Me like a grain of mustard seed, you say unto the mountain move and it&rsquo;ll move.&rdquo; Most of us try and they say they have faith in God and nothing happens and then they blame God for they don&rsquo;t get no results but if we understood what the Master Jesus would imply in this faith, He&rsquo;s not implying a faith in God, He&rsquo;s implying a faith in ourselves to shift the ego out of the way to allow God. You must have a faith in yourself to get your ego out of the way to allow God to move the mountain for you. Do we move our ego out of the way and let God work for us? Or do we block God and still let our ego stay in the way? &ldquo;We have faith in God, I want this man to be well Lord. I have faith in You he&rsquo;s gonna be well&rdquo; but in the first place your ego is so puffed up demanding God to make the man well, God is not making the man well, but if you have the faith to move your ego out of the way and see the Divine Will flow, the man is well. Now a typical example of this getting the ego out of the way, there are many examples of it in the life of Jesus healing and many other great Saints in the world but Let&rsquo;s take one that we&rsquo;re familiar with because we&rsquo;ve read it so often already, it&rsquo;s the centurion. He was a Roman and Jesus was of Jewish descent, he left his home because his son was ill with all humility now to humble himself as a conquering nation over another nation that was subjugated to go and ask, these are already the conditions already set in motion, you gotta realize what is happening. A man from a high station is like Mr. Johnson coming to asking somebody in Japan to do something for his family, you follow me, it&rsquo;s the relationship so he&rsquo;s coming down from a high level of authority to another level of behavior. When he met the Man, the Master Jesus, if he had any belief that this was a real master that could do something or because his servants told him that this Man did do certain things or he saw some of his servants who were supposed to be ill were well now and he had some conviction that this was his only treasure, his only son, his only heir to all his wealth, he might as well ask, the doctors are not doing anything for him. So he&rsquo;s humbling himself, he&rsquo;s going, but he&rsquo;s ashamed for two reasons: One, he&rsquo;s a conquering hero and he&rsquo;s a man of high station. Two, he is not of the same nationality and the same customs and traditions, therefore he would not want that Man into his house, that Man looked down or there would be conflict. 1:30 So these are things he&rsquo;s fighting with himself, so he comes to the Man and says, &ldquo;My son is ill, would you come? No, would you just say the word?&rdquo; He corrects himself, &ldquo;If you only say the word my son would be well.&rdquo; He corrects himself in the middle of his request, &ldquo;Please come, my son is ill&hellip; No, if you only say the word. Just where you are, stay right here, don&rsquo;t go no place, just say something, give me some consolation from yourself.&rdquo; Then the Master looks at him, &ldquo;In all this land I&rsquo;ve never seen such faith.&rdquo; In His own people who have been exposed to centuries of spiritual giants and here&rsquo;s a people who have been conquering the world and slaughtering, comes along a man with the conviction far transcending everybody with so much humility to get his ego out of the way to let this Master have compassion and work. So the Master says, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo; Alright, He even emphasized that the man was so humble by saying &ldquo;In all this land He didn&rsquo;t see such faith. Not in all Israel have I seen such faith.&rdquo; Now the man went his way, He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;go home, your son gonna get well, and don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go in peace,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s done, the way you want it, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; He turns back and goes up the road and he meets his servants and his servants says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb that man, you don&rsquo;t have to humble yourself no more to that Jewish individual. You&rsquo;re a Roman, you&rsquo;ve of a high class, why get involved, your son is well. Forget about asking for help, maintain your superiority.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;what time did the boy get well?&rdquo; And then they compare times. Now here is a wonderful technique of a man of high awareness, authority, a conquering hero, who got his ego out of the way by having faith in his ability to move it because it was exactly the same time the boy got well when the Master said, &ldquo;Go home.&rdquo; He got his ego out of the way. Now I&rsquo;ll show you another instance where another woman got her ego out of the way and got her healing. She was a Sumerian, she&rsquo;s walking along and had a terrible disease over the years, she saw this man standing there with His group of disciples around Him and she said to herself, &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t deserve anything from Him, but this is a pretty horrible thing to live all my life and die of. If I would only go and touch that Man&rsquo;s clothes, not even touch the Man, not even ask the Man for anything, his clothes because that&rsquo;s the least of all things, maybe I&rsquo;ll get well.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not the faith that the Man has the power to heal, it&rsquo;s the faith she can shift her ego out of the way to go to the humblest aspect to get something from this source of consciousness. So she goes with this attitude of humility, shifting her ego out of the way and reach out to touch and the Master turns around says to His disciples, &ldquo;Somebody touched Me.&rdquo; You can hear that Jewish accent, &ldquo;Someone here touched me.&rdquo; The disciples says &ldquo;Master what&rsquo;s the matter with You, everybody is touching You.&rdquo; This is the relationship, the humor in it, but it&rsquo;s beautiful spiritual growth. He says &ldquo;No, no, someone here has touched Me, power has gone out.&rdquo; Virtue is power, a healing force was drawn from the source of His being and He turns and He sees the woman and again He comments on her faith. Most people think &ldquo;her faith in God,&rdquo; He&rsquo;s commenting on her faith to shift her ego out of the way to let the Divine Principle flow and then there are groups He commented on their ability to shift their ego out of the way, but He admonished them, He says, &ldquo;I heal you now, but go tell no man.&rdquo; They had the ability to shift their ego, but He knew they had certain reservations in themselves, that&rsquo;s why He tell them &ldquo;Go tell no man.&rdquo; And you know what happened, they couldn&rsquo;t, they got up telling everybody all over, they made a whole mess of it, &ldquo;Hey Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s son did so-and-so for me!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs. Mary&rsquo;s son did this for me, see me now today, all good?&rdquo; And before you know it, they&rsquo;ve blabbered all over the neighborhood and He looks back and sees&hellip; instead of learning the lesson of humility, you understand, he healed them in spite of their ego. Some people are going to be healed in spite of their ego, but they will have to come back and learn a lesson. Now you have an illustration of a man who is being healed in spite of his ego and lived to pursue spiritual growth and this is the life of Lazarus. Now Lazarus was a wealthy man, he was not a poor man, and the Master Jesus is a renunciate and a Master and He has disciples who are renouncing the life and walking with Him. So it would be like coming into the home of Lazarus and being invited and all the bills are being paid for the disciples at no cost to the Master, his way of showing his charity to these spiritual people who are trying to do something. His sisters are all involved, one is caught up in washing the dishes, and the others are sitting down listening and engrossing themselves with the beautiful love that is coming out and Lazarus, although he is a very charitable man, he is still caught up with his possessions, his business, and so forth, but his love for the Master, whatever the Master is. Now the Master uses a parable in his presence, when a young man came to Him and asked Him what should he do to enquire or obtain everlasting life or gain the Kingdom of Heaven. The lesson was not for the rich man, the lesson was for Lazarus, because He was living in Lazarus&rsquo; house when it happened. He says, &ldquo;Go sell everything and then follow me.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a hard thing to do.&rdquo; Well He knew in Lazarus&rsquo; mind, it would be the hardest thing for Lazarus to do either, you see, but Lazarus is a disciple in a different category, he&rsquo;s a householder disciple, he&rsquo;s not in the formal sense of a disciple walking by the footsteps of the Master, but he wants to discipline himself, he wants to attain the realization, he wants to share his sustenance, but he doesn&rsquo;t know how to break loose from within himself the hold of his wealth on his mechanism, but the Master is using this young man in relation to Lazarus to show him something. Lazarus can&rsquo;t break loose so the Master and His retinue takes off to go to someplace, it seems natural for Him to go away, it may be well planned for Lazarus to get a lesson. Lazarus being in His presence, the lesson is never going be learned, go away from His presence then the lesson has got to be learned sooner or later. He&rsquo;s away from Lazarus and a message comes that Lazarus is dead. Well He gets up and says &ldquo;this is not a death to the death.&rdquo; Everybody thinks He&rsquo;s nuts, well in Jairus&rsquo; case He said &ldquo;the child is asleep, she ain&rsquo;t dead&rdquo; and they thought He was still nuts then and here His best friend Lazarus and when He goes back He says &ldquo;this is not a death unto the death&rdquo; so he goes back and when He goes back it is three days after he goes back. The message came to Him that his friend was sick too you know and &ldquo;You should do something&rdquo; but He didn&rsquo;t do nothing, then the message came that he&rsquo;s dead and He still didn&rsquo;t do nothing. He came back and He&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;this is not a death unto the death.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s allowing Lazarus to die and allowing Lazarus to experience the fact that he can&rsquo;t carry his wealth with him in the grave. 1:40 He&rsquo;s allowing Lazarus to realize this is totally a matter of attitude and desire in consciousness that has got to free him now, it&rsquo;s a fate to shift the ego out of the way once and for all to let God take over in consciousness. He&rsquo;s allowing this man to experience this thing in a tangible way for the first time, if he never would experience anything more tangible, death is very tangible, He&rsquo;s allowing him to have it. He comes back and then his sisters come running, &ldquo;Master You partook of our hospitality and this is the way you treat us? We are Your closest friends, Lazarus was Your closest friend to You, You let him die and You heal all other people and raise their children and did so much.&rdquo; Well you can imagine the despondency, the despair, the resentment, the rejection that is going on, well it went on in their minds. Now He goes to the grave to heal Lazarus, then the remark is &ldquo;But Master he&rsquo;s been two to three days, what good is it to bring him down from the grave, he&rsquo;s dead already.&rdquo; You see how the rational mind is thinking, how the ego is getting in the way of the Divine Principle? He&rsquo;s allowing the man to experience non-ego, the sisters and all their friends are imposing more ego, no more humility, there&rsquo;s no room for humility. Alright, He goes to the grave and He shouts in a loud voice saying, &ldquo;Lazarus come forth!&rdquo; And then He rebukes Himself, using ego against humility, &ldquo;Father I did not have say, I could just think of it and it would be alright.&rdquo; (Adano laughs). He was showing them how to get their ego out of the way, in a shout big brash voice He said, &ldquo;Lazarus come forth!&rdquo; Everybody wants something in a big, dramatic expression of Divine Law and He&rsquo;s remarking to Himself, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t have to say that, I could just think the process out.&rdquo; Because He knew how to get His ego out of the way, but He had to show them, He had to make them conscious that they were caught up in an ego process and that it&rsquo;s not the faith in God that makes us whole, it&rsquo;s the faith in ourself to shift the ego out of the way to make God make us whole or to allow God to make us whole before we can really be whole. Now in relation to ego and humility and working this psychic power or spiritual forces, He told one physician, he says &ldquo;Physician heal thyself.&rdquo; Now if it was not a matter of ego versus humility, He would never tell that man that, He would just heal the man and go His way, but He wanted the physician to realize why he was not doing the healing that he was intended to do or why he was not getting the results he was supposed to get. It was because he was not able to shift his own ego out of the way for the healing to occur. Now the disciples had the same problem, He gave them the ability to go out in pairs and to heal, they went out and they healed and there were some that they couldn&rsquo;t heal and they came back and they said, &ldquo;Master, we couldn&rsquo;t heal them.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t comment, just at that very moment they were talking, right on the sidewalk somewhere somebody&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;In the name of Jesus Christ I heal you&rdquo; and that person was healed and the disciples turned around and said, &ldquo;How dare you heal in the name of my Master?! How dare you do this?!&rdquo; and the Master rebuked them because they still had ego, their own ego was getting in the way too even when they were living with a Master and had performed a certain amount of healing and they couldn&rsquo;t heal others, certain groups, their ego was still getting in the way. So He allowed them to experience the relation that they were going to argue with a man who said &ldquo;In the name of Jesus Christ I heal you&rdquo; and the person was healed but His disciples were admonished for their own ego. Now we have another thing to observe in the spiritual life of a spiritual Master with the spiritual forces. Masters don&rsquo;t perform any miracle, they only do the will of God according to the need of the disciple or the friends of the disciple or the person for which they are doing it for a certain lesson. So they don&rsquo;t do three, four, or five of the same thing all the time, it&rsquo;s just one or two of it, they don&rsquo;t raise the dead everyday, they don&rsquo;t heal the blind everyday, they don&rsquo;t feed everybody everyday, it&rsquo;s only because there are certain lessons, certain needs to bring about understanding. Psychics go about doing this everyday for a living, a Master if He&rsquo;s going to feed a group of people, He&rsquo;s going to make them earn what they ate in some form of action that they&rsquo;ll never forget as long as they live, that this was an act of God and not of mental trickery or hypnosis or some form of mass hallucination. They gonna earn what they get because this is not a universe of something for nothing, it is always something for something, it&rsquo;s a law of cause and effect. He fed them and they were satisfied and if they had any reservation that this was trickery, they had to sweep up the crumbs and make note of it that they had twelve baskets full of it. Twelve baskets of crumbs for 4000 people, do you know how long it takes? You try sweeping up for 4000 people, twelve baskets of crumbs, you work sweeping up! You gonna remember that and the next time they had another bunch of it left over because they earned what they got. Now if it was apparition or seances, He gonna make them work for it to see that it&rsquo;s not. He came into the upper chamber at the resurrection and Thomas who was a psychic scientist of the time, he had no doubting as we think &ldquo;doubting Thomas,&rdquo; scientific curiosity, scientific indignation, or scientific caution is the nature of Thomas, he was a scientist. Jewish people were well aware of psychic studies, they knew the difference between a real prophet and a pseudo-prophet, they knew the difference between extra-sensory conditions and what was a genuine spiritual truth. So his first remark when they saw the form, you know what Thomas said, &ldquo;You are an apparition, it&rsquo;s gotta be, this can&rsquo;t be no genuine thing. Do you think we were wasting our time, spinning our wheels with a Master only to indulge in psychic phenomena? You guys down here are off the beam, you&rsquo;re all grieving for nothing, you get convinced too quick that you&rsquo;ve got the real thing, let us see if it&rsquo;s the real thing, then let&rsquo;s see if the Master&rsquo;s not true proving it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come Thomas, feel, make sure now this is not an apparition.&rdquo; This is another range of our level of development in Man not yet perceived by Man, &ldquo;Touch, feel, flesh and blood. You got any food here that I can eat?&rdquo; Now which apparition is going to eat some bread and cheese and drink a little goat milk? But that Master sat down to sup and every time He appeared after His death with His disciples or two of them or three of them or one of them, there was evidence He ate with them. Now my own Master said &ldquo;If ever you meditate&rdquo; and He says &ldquo;Jesus is not dead because He&rsquo;s in a resurrected form and all the Masters are in that state and if you do have an internal experience with these Masters, to make sure that you don&rsquo;t have a hallucination, ask them to partake of some food from your refrigerator in this 20th century and when They take, They&rsquo;re not going to take all, They&rsquo;re going to take a portion of it, but if you&rsquo;re ever in doubt, make sure you don&rsquo;t use the last portion that&rsquo;s left on the plate, it will never decay as long as it&rsquo;s there without putting it back in the refrigerator.&rdquo; 1:50 He says, &ldquo;And now you got proof that that man was there and you got proof that you were exposed to another realm of reality, the real realm of reality for the first time.&rdquo; So many people say they saw Jesus at a seance or so forth, or Masters or Saints at a seance but believe me this, no Saint, no Master would come into a physical frame of another person to make Himself known or to instruct, it would a highly disregard for the laws of truth. If He&rsquo;s truth, if He&rsquo;s a real genuine teacher of truth, He will have taken His own voluntary self into a physical birth and go through the trials and tribulations of a human being and live through the very tangible facts to make those who know the truth experience it, He&rsquo;ll never defile Himself by trying to come in and talk through some psychic process. So no one can tell you that a Saint does that or they had contact to such and such a Saint through a medium, you can have visions and you can have revelations and you can have materializations, but you cannot have seances with Saints. So the churches say they believe in the communion of Saints, they believe in the communication between Man and the Saint, between one level of realization in a physical frame with another level of realization in a higher degree of the same frame and they believe in the forgiveness of sins or the self-modification of the law of karma by effort and they believe in a life eternal because energy is not created or destroyed. So we do survive our decent burials so let us try and get our ego out of the way and have the faith to move it and let the Divine Life Principle flow. Now remember Jesus said &ldquo;I have come that you may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; This is the only thing He said He came for, of all His statements what did He come for in the first place? &ldquo;I have come that you may have life&hellip;&rdquo; this principle in Him is life flowing and that we can realize it that we too can tap it if we can shift our ego out of the way, the spiritual phenomenas will come through not the psychic phenomena. That&rsquo;s why He said &ldquo;What would it benefit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?&rdquo; He knew psychic phenomena, which Master do not know psychic phenomena, that would be untrue to say a Master is unfamiliar with psychic phenomena. A Master knows where the psychic phenomena starts and where it ends, how many of us know where it starts and where it ends, how many are trapped in the psychic phenomena and don&rsquo;t know how to get out of it? A Master is not dealing in psychic phenomena, He is dealing with behavioral principles, how to establish peace in a tissue mechanism, how to tap the source of it and release it, how to awaken the sensitivity of consciousness of it, and how to establish its strength that they act as a magnetic pole to put us in the right place, in the right time, in the right experience, or synchronize us with the divinity which is the Divine Plan or Divine Will, this is what they call the Path of the Masters, this is the Soul Science, this is now spirituality and not spirituality that passes as psychic phenomena, there&rsquo;s a vast difference between the two. One is speculative, the other one is verifiable for all Men and don&rsquo;t hide behind words you see. It can be experienced if we get our ego out of the way that&rsquo;s why humility, of all the beatitudes on the Sermon on the Mount or the &ldquo;attitudes of behavior,&rdquo; the most challenging, the most demanding because it&rsquo;s a moment-to-moment expression, is the one called &ldquo;Meekly wait and murmur not.&rdquo; This is gonna challenge you every second, all the rest don&rsquo;t challenge you as much, but this one challenges you the most because how many can meekly wait and murmur not? Because murmuring is not getting your ego out of the way or grumbling you know is not getting the ego out of the way and to wait, I&rsquo;ll tell you this is pretty difficult without that bead of tranquilizers around your neck. We need that meditation very badly, we need the meditation to establish this condition in us. True Masters, there are many Masters who live who perform no miracles because there are no miracles to perform, but They help their disciples or others to realize their true potential, which is the greatest miracle, They help them to see the difference between living in an ego bound type of behavior or in a humility service-full type of behavior, They show them the difference between being free-men all Lord of themselves or being slaves reaping the seeds of what they have sown, suffering their own Calvaries. Now if the Master Jesus did have twelve disciples and had many others who were not in the formal sense of the word, those who were in the formal sense of the word all denied Him and those who were not associated in the formal sense of the word disciple where around Him at the most tragic moments. Joseph of Arimathea, Lazarus, and many other such men, the most astonishing one was the one on the cross, the thief, of all disciples he was the greatest, today the church classify him as the Saint of the impossible. Here is a man about the same age of Jesus being crucified on the cross, grew up in an environment that was familiar with, he might have been a guerilla fighting in the backwoods against the Roman occupation, caught by the Romans for the first time now, he might have been a boyhood friend of Jesus, when they were playing with clay pigeons and Jesus threw up His and it flew away and he threw up his and it didn&rsquo;t fly away, fell down to the ground and got disgusted with the Roman occupation and took off to the hills, Jesus went to some other way, but there&rsquo;s the conditions that can be involved in this man&rsquo;s life because these words that transpire between him and Jesus brings up many problems in it. He&rsquo;s dying on the cross, this thief, the next criminal is dying also on the other side of the Master, and the next criminal is saying, &ldquo;Hey buddy, you healed the sick, you raised the dead, why the hell don&rsquo;t You get off and heal Yourself? Why are You strung up here like us? You so great, everybody worship you as God, get off, help yourself.&rdquo; Ego playing the role again and the one on the other side says &ldquo;Hey you have no right to criticize Avi here, He ain&rsquo;t done nothing, you&rsquo;ve done something and I&rsquo;ve done something, we got a right to be strung up here like two clay pigeons or something&rdquo; so he turns around and he looks at the Master. The first word he addresses the man is very significant, he did not call the man a prophet, he did not call the man a saint, he did not call the man by His name, he said, &ldquo;Master&rdquo; very specific, or Rabboni or Rabbi, which was very very specific, then the next two words and the emphasis &ldquo;Remember me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Master, remember me when you come into Your kingdom!&rdquo; (loud voice) or did he say &ldquo;Master, remember me when you come into your kingdom&rdquo; (normal tone of voice). 2:00 There is a vast shift in behavioral focus between the two expressions of the same words. One is ego and one is humility and ego is to say, &ldquo;You owe me something,&rdquo; humility is to say &ldquo;we have been along the same road but can&rsquo;t make it by myself&rdquo; and the Master&rsquo;s reply is significant, &ldquo;On this day&rdquo; that is to say &ldquo;at this very moment friend, you and I shall be in para-dise,&rdquo; on this very instant your consciousness and My consciousness and the Life Stream will be beyond,&rdquo; para is beyond, dise is desires. &ldquo;We shall merge beyond all desires, we will be in the desire-less state, no more rebirth for you because I truly remember you, I&rsquo;m truly pulling you out.&rdquo; Now all the disciples that lived on the Earth had desires while they were living with the Master Jesus of their own nature, one wanted to be the top center of attraction, to go out and teach the Romans and the other ones and so forth and here&rsquo;s a man who has no desire of any kind, just to be remembered in consciousness by a Master who has the total consciousness. This is a subtle interplay of behavior between two people based upon a meditative realization. The man is dying, he&rsquo;s not acting meditation, he&rsquo;s living meditation because moment-to-moment breath has brought him understanding of himself. He&rsquo;s gonna die sooner or later and he&rsquo;s seeing deliverance standing right next, or hanging right next to him and he&rsquo;s seeing the interplay of the other man&rsquo;s behavior, how he hasn&rsquo;t let go of his ego and he&rsquo;s still criticizing this other individual and he might have been present in many of the miracles that the Master Jesus had performed, hiding still from the Roman guards when they were searching on the wanted list, he might have his name on the wanted list, and he still might have taken on various disguises to go and listen to this Master teach, only to redeem himself from his ways, these people were very spiritual at one time. They might have shifted away from their spirituality because of the occupation by the Romans only because they couldn&rsquo;t feed themselves or survive in the hills so this man might be one of those such types of personalities, let alone the mere fact that he had to kill or steal and we develop these hard habits out of pressures and he&rsquo;s asking to be remembered. His eyes might have met the Master&rsquo;s eyes at many times, at many of His meetings without betraying himself and the Master sensing his consciousness might not betray him to no one and hardened by time and the process of aging and despondency, the man is still saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t You remember me?&rdquo; So he&rsquo;s calling Him Master, it&rsquo;s a recognition of a higher self, &ldquo;Master remember me when Thy comest into Thy kingdom?&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;I am Your disciple, but I might not be formally Your disciple. I realize that You are truly a Realized Master, I am willing to make the adjustment in my behavior to be a disciple, but at this stage where I am now, it ain&rsquo;t possible, it&rsquo;s too late, all You can do for me is give me an extension of that abundant life You talk so much about and I&rsquo;m begging with all humility possible in these few words.&rdquo; This is an exchange of feeling that has to transmit between two men, the words may not be enough to communicate what is passing between two men, their very extrasensory nature is passing in those words, their extrasensory quality are passing between that Master and that disciple, there are very psychic principles are at work, there are spiritual principles at work. The disciple who meditates will have to get in to feel the frequencies, to feel the relationship occurring between the one man who is a criminal and other man who was realized and what is He going to free this man for? If paradise is another place they are going to go to, &ldquo;you and I are going to be in that other place, why don&rsquo;t we go together in the physical frame?&rdquo; Why leave the physical frame, there are more subtle forces at work, taking the physical frame is one, but taking a physical frame with a consciousness that is not healed from desire patterns is no good. Why tag along another disciple behind you who hasn&rsquo;t been healed of his psychological inadequacies, even if you give him an uncorruptable body, you see? Even if you resurrect the man&rsquo;s body and let him walk behind you as a true disciple, it still has unfulfilled desires, he&rsquo;s still going to ponder back to that earth plane, those accomplishments that he could have chased the Romans out of the country, that he could have created a tremendous revolution and get them all out, he&rsquo;s still going to have this back-pull, this feedback of consciousness. So that&rsquo;s not what He&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;On this day,&rdquo; in this very moment, &ldquo;this interplay of life and association of consciousness between you and I,&rdquo; body form to body form, consciousness to consciousness, that this very instant, on this day, not June 12th, not April 10th or whatever it is, at this day, this instant of time, &ldquo;you and I,&rdquo; the inner consciousness in this frame, &ldquo;will be,&rdquo; the common bond that holds us together now, it&rsquo;s meditation going on between two beings on the cross, the moments of death, &ldquo;will experience that level of existence beyond all desires.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where the Father consciousness does exist, in a true desireless state because He has no desire. Now this other man has desire, but this other man is humble enough to ask to be remembered, knowing he can&rsquo;t make it by himself. The other one on the other side thinks he can make it by himself, therefore he doesn&rsquo;t need no help. The other one knows he can&rsquo;t make it by himself. Spiritual people can&rsquo;t make it by themselves that&rsquo;s why they turn to other evolved beings, communion of the Saints / Masters, we need someone to give us a pull, to get us past these levels, and He is saying &ldquo;you and I will be in that state beyond desire.&rdquo; Now being beyond desire is resurrection, to remain in the state of desire, if they&rsquo;re unfulfilled is reincarnation. What are you reincarnating for? An unfulfilled desire, let&rsquo;s see it in nature let alone ourselves. Here is a tree, you plant the seed it grows up, in the springtime it comes out as a flower, in the summertime it blooms out, autumn time the fruit comes, it drops off in the wintertime, but the tree is not dead, only a change of climate. Next spring comes back, the fruit tree is growing again, goes through the same cycle year in and year out producing the same type of fruit, reincarnating over and over, putting forth the same repetitive patterns, the same results, not changing. Now let&rsquo;s see resurrection, here is a grubby looking green worm come along and gorge itself to death, then decides to spin his own shroud around him, and then wakes up a beautiful butterfly, glorious colors, no longer a grubby worm, flying away into freedom, resurrected. He&rsquo;s not a worm, he&rsquo;s a fly now, he&rsquo;s a butterfly not restricted to the Earth, taking off into space, and you got it going on all the time. 2:10 Reincarnation is a repeating of the same old things over and over, the desire for the apple tree to give more apples over and over every season to come out with more apples. The glow worm has a desire, not to be a glow worm, not to grubby around in the mud no more, to take off in the clear blue skies of infinity. Happy is the Soul that can fly, happy is the consciousness that gets beyond, para beyond, desire, no more desires, and desirelessness is not stagnation, desirelessness is freedom to handle responsibilities, not to run from responsibilities, it&rsquo;s a big difference. Masters are not freeing you from any responsibility, They are freeing you for the ability to handle responsibilities. Therefore the Saint, He&rsquo;s called today now of the impossible, was freed from certain types of behavior in order to teach people how to behave. Audience: How do you know which responsibility it is, yours or somebody else&rsquo;s? How do you determine what is your responsibility that you&rsquo;re freed from? Adano: You are gonna be freed for the responsibility of others in the process of understanding themselves by being an example of how to work it out for them. You see a Master shows you how to behave by sitting down with a group of people with the same problems and showing them how to maintain their inner attitude, their inner balance, and work the problem without any stress, without any turmoil, without any tension. He&rsquo;s freed for this ability, for this particular condition, now what is He freed from? He&rsquo;s freed from tension, He&rsquo;s freed from aggravation, He&rsquo;s freed from grumbling about the condition by showing you how to free yourself so He does the thing. So He takes on your responsibility which you think is a responsibility, that it&rsquo;s so grave in your consciousness, He takes it on and shows you it&rsquo;s not so bad if you have the right attitude. The thing has to be faced, the thing has to be done, but let us do it not with a grumbling attitude, not with an attitude of tension, let us do it with the attitude of love. Now it is not the reward that I get out of it that I&rsquo;m doing it for, it is the fact that the thing has to be done and somebody has got to do it and if it has to be done and somebody has got to do it, let us do it in the way it should be done without grumbling about it. The occupation should have nothing to do with detracting from spirituality, occupation is made for Man, not Man for the occupation. If the Sabbath was made for Man, occupation is made for Man, not Man for the occupation. To live in this world and be occupied in some form or another, that was made that way and we were not made for it, it was made for us. If the universe was made after Man was created, Man would have to create everything for himself and then Man would be creator for the thing. The thing was created for Man, God created the planets, the trees, the animals, and finally He decided to make Man. I guess He was pretty fed up when He decided to do it because He might regret it that he did do it but He made Man last, therefore He made everything for Man. If you reverse the process and put Man first and say everything was made after, who would make it after? Man would be dead first because he would have nothing there to sustain him, he wouldn&rsquo;t know where to turn, he wouldn&rsquo;t know what to invent to survive. Let&rsquo;s say Man is made first in the blank universe of nothing, here he is standing totally in space by himself and the Creator refused to have anything to do with him, &ldquo;Now go ahead creation, you make in this void, you find out what you want&rdquo; you know what would happen? He wouldn&rsquo;t know what a fish is because where will he get the idea of a fish, he wouldn&rsquo;t know what a tree is, where would he get the idea from, he wouldn&rsquo;t know what a mountain is, where would he get the idea? These ideas are the result of he being last, coming into him, they&rsquo;re not the result of him projecting it out, he didn&rsquo;t project these ideas out, these ideas came to him after he was made. Audience: However a man does get ideas of things that never exist before as far as he knows. Adano: I&rsquo;m not laughing at this statement, I&rsquo;m laughing at the fact that it is not Man who gets the idea of things he don&rsquo;t know about. One scientist says, &ldquo;the truth is facing you right in your face right now but you can&rsquo;t recognize it.&rdquo; So the truth is there, the idea is there, that&rsquo;s why he says &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun.&rdquo; The idea is there, but you can&rsquo;t recognize the idea, it has always been, it&rsquo;s coming into you, you&rsquo;re not projecting it out. As I said, the man did not project the idea of a fish out of his mind, he did not project the idea of having a tree out of his mind, he is not first, he&rsquo;s last, therefore all the ideas, all the things that are there, all that he can handle, are coming into him. That&rsquo;s why we have an expanded conciousness, every level of expansion, he absorbs that much, and he utilizes that much. Now in the total consciousness, he&rsquo;s sees everything as they are, but this is what they call realization, and there are so few people with total realization. Audience: Well is your creative attitude and the fact that you can get into a creative attitude, is that a part of the universe expanding within him? Adano: &ldquo;God made Man is His own image,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s atomic, so the atoms was made before Man already, &ldquo;and He made him in his own likeness&rdquo; that is total memory. Now that includes past, present, and future just think for one moment what total memory involves. Total memory involves past, present, and future, therefore there is no beginning and there is no end, that&rsquo;s the likeness of God. &ldquo;In His own image&rdquo; would be the atomic principle, where&rsquo;s it gonna go, it&rsquo;s all energy, it can&rsquo;t be created, it can&rsquo;t be destroyed, and &ldquo;in His own likeness&rdquo; it&rsquo;s got to be the total memory or omnipresence / omniscience / omnipotence, which is total memory. Now we are not using total memory, we are using phases of the total memory in relation to our evolution because the process is going forward all the time so we realize why Jesus said, &ldquo;Sabbath was made for Man and not Man for the Sabbath.&rdquo; Everything is being made for us to experience, not for us to be caught in it. In other words we are not be enslaved by it, these things are supposed to serve us, that&rsquo;s why you go back to your scriptures it says &ldquo;and God gave Man to have the power to have dominion over the Universe but not ownership.&rdquo; Alright if you have dominion over the universe you&rsquo;re only a manager in this universe, the boss is still the boss, He owns the place. You know many managers think they are the boss you know, I&rsquo;ve met such managers too who think they own the place, still a boss still owns the place, the boss&rsquo;s son comes alone and says &ldquo;Hey buddy, I&rsquo;m still in charge here yet.&rdquo; But this is the relationship, Man in his relationship to his evolution and his environment and the creation is endowed with the power to control and direct it, but he&rsquo;s not endowed with the power to take it with him or own it and this why Jesus allowed Lazarus to die, to show him the relationship of his consciousness. 2:20 He accumulated wealth, he was philanthropic, charitable, but he can&rsquo;t break the relationship, he can&rsquo;t break the desire pattern to let go. He&rsquo;s still thinking in his mind &ldquo;I own this, this is mine, this is mine, this is mine, I own it, I have power.&rdquo; And when we pass out of the frame we find out that we don&rsquo;t own anything and we can&rsquo;t carry anything and this is a stark reality, this is a shock to the consciousness that you can&rsquo;t carry a dollar bill with you when you die and Chinese people are stupid enough to you know, when they die, they put dollar bills and they burn it and they put food there and everything and lots of nationalities do all these things for him to have a happy afterlife, he&rsquo;s going to carry it with him and the family are looking there you know, glum, &ldquo;What are they, crazy nut, what did he need it for, why can&rsquo;t they buy us some more food in the house for all of us,&rdquo; you see? Audience: Can we go back to this cross thing just a minute? Would you say then that Christ chose the resurrection in place of reincarnation from a karmic standpoint? Adano: Yes. Audience: In other words, He had the choice to choose between the two? Adano: Yes. Audience: Well then was there really a choice or was it a must that He chose resurrection? In other words, if He was a Master, then He had already overcome all of His karma in the beginning, right? Adano: If He did not have the opportunity to choose in a physical frame, we would not as human beings want to choose. He&rsquo;s showing by example we have the power of choice and as long as we have the power of choice, we too can choose to be where we want to be in this frame of relationship with God. Audience: Well then where would the old concept come from that He did this to wipe all of our sins away? What started this? Adano: This was &ldquo;Paul-ian&rdquo; theology, not His theology, not His teachings, but you must understand the writing of Paul before you can say that it is involving personality or it&rsquo;s involving a cosmic principle. In a cosmic principle, the Christ-self or the intuitive nature or the intuitive self in Man absolves us, which in the world, the intuitive self in all of us, in each one of us, absolves us, absolves each one of us from making erring choices with its repercussions because intuitive choice does not err, it has the ability to make an unerring choice all the time, it is the extrasensory capacity in the being, the five senses continue to make choices with error. Now in a personality relationship to say that Jesus was the man who died to save the sins of the world, this is not true, a man cannot take the sins of the world, he can only suspend the karmic conditions of some of the disciples to which He&rsquo;s involved with and those whose follow in His path as disciples, no matter how many incarnations or how many centuries after, when you decide to follow in the pathway of a disciple then your personality traits by the very principle will be absolved. Now, but when you take the principle itself, as the Christ principle, the intuitive nature in Man, this is an absolving principle for all of us. I can be born a Hindu living in India and Krishna, which is the Christ principle, would absolve me. I can be born in America and the Christ principle of Jesus can absolve me, but it&rsquo;s the principle that absolves the behavior nature, it&rsquo;s not the personality that absolves, but if you follow the discipline of the personality, sooner or later you end up in the principle and you leave the personality behind because the disciple would discover the difference between the personality and the principle by the process of meditation, he will see the difference if he is a true disciple, he would be exposed to that principle. Now I&rsquo;ll show you how, remember &ldquo;he that doeth the will of My Father is My brother and My sister and he that followeth in My words is My disciple.&rdquo; Now Christian Saints have all been stamped by Jesus in the principle and they are Christian disciples, what are they stamped with, stigmata wounds, evidence that the man did live, not evidence of a mass hypnosis or a deep psychosomatic condition, they are stamped because they tried to be His disciples and live by the disciplines He laid down. Now the man who tries to be like His brother and do the will of God is stamped with a different thing, he&rsquo;s stamped with the realization of what is going on in the principle and this man transmits another level of awareness, he makes you comprehend what the principle was in Jesus. Disciple is stamped with the stigmata wounds, Masters of other religions show you their relationship between the Christ principle and their inner consciousness, they show you what you are, that&rsquo;s where they teach you &ldquo;the truth will make you free, freemen all Lord of yourself.&rdquo; The disciple is stamped with the stigmata wounds as testimony that that particular Master lived. Now we have this in most of your Catholic Saints, you see the Catholic Saints follow the discipline, the non-Catholic Saints swallow the will of God and come out His brother and sister. Now there was a man who said, &ldquo;I heal you in the name of Christ&rdquo; and the man is healed, he wasn&rsquo;t a disciple, but the disciple follows the words of the Master, this separates the disciple and the brother / sister relationship with the Master. Now I have a personal friend who had a daughter, at the age of 12 this daughter used to walk in the room and says, &ldquo;Mommy, don&rsquo;t disturb me I&rsquo;m going to talk to Jesus right now&rdquo; and she&rsquo;d sit down in a corner and she&rsquo;d talk and she&rsquo;d look at the daughter and her daughter was talking to Jesus and making all kind of antics talking so she says to herself if her daughter is seeing Jesus truly and this daughter exhibited certain qualities to convince her that she was not faking anything, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I not see Jesus? I&rsquo;m gonna to sit down and find out for myself.&rdquo; So she sat down, day in and day out in that one corner of the house in Los Angeles, and one day she saw a big flash of light right in front of her, no matter where she turned this light was all around her and she can&rsquo;t talk and all of a sudden she saw the Master Jesus standing right there and you know what He said to her? &ldquo;I am your elder brother, you are not My disciple.&rdquo; Therefore she had no stigmata wounds on her body, but from that day on this woman has traveled on the inner planes wherever the great Master Jesus has gone, but her daughter has developed certain qualities that make her, today she&rsquo;s in a convent now, very much what a disciple would be, she would have the stigmata wounds eventually, but the mother does not live in a convent. 2:30 She wrote a book about her life, it&rsquo;s called The Divine Atom and in this book she tells when the Master Jesus told her He was her elder brother, she was not His disciple. She realized at that time what He meant in the scriptures centuries ago. When a disciple follows a Master, he&rsquo;s stamped by that Master, when a disciple follows the Will of God, he will discover his brotherhood with the Masters. Remember this child was seeing Jesus and experiencing it, she saw her child going through this, she wanted to find out, she made the choice, she didn&rsquo;t want her to become a disciple, she wanted to find out the truth for herself. When she found out the truth, it put her in a different category, it gave her a freedom because she had the choice, get the idea? We have this choice, but He doesn&rsquo;t take away from us that the brother and the disciple because you begin to realize that all life is discipline, you see? I guess we talk too much (group conversation).</p>
<h2 id="1968-november---volume-2-odor-of-divinity">1968 November - Volume 2 Odor of Divinity</h2>
<p>Adano68_11Vol2_OdorofDivinityQ1RRNW6 - &hellip; going on with the people in the room, it has nothing to do with prayer or anything, in those moments of complete silence, this is what is being transferred, but that is what I&rsquo;m saying, this is what is flowing to the individual and this is what Jesus is saying, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in My Name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; which is strictly a bringing together of consciousness and the first thing you begin to perceive or experience is bliss or peace, then this consciousness, this extrasensory nature and this strength comes to you. See the strength comes out of the person eventually, without that strength, he has nothing to go on. Audience: Could you break down the word Meditation and read through that again? Adano: Well it&rsquo;s Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities Towards an Intuitive or Independent of the senses Observation and Oneness of the Noumena. Audience: We&rsquo;ll write it down for you. Audience: Adano, there is some prashad made from (inaudible). Adano: Good, where is the prashad? Audience: It&rsquo;s in the refrigerator. Adano: Ok. (inaudible). We always seem to be caught in that question, If you taste salt water and he tastes salt water, is your salt water saltier than his salt water from the same cup? You may have a bigger mouthful than he has but salt water is still salt water. This is the question, when we say a Master is more superior, there&rsquo;s no such thing. Audience: You told me I should pray to the form and not to God. Adano: I said to God, not the form, pray to God, not the form. The form is only a garment in which God is passing through, let me put it this way, what&rsquo;s the difference between wearing a tunic shirt and wearing a shirt like his? It&rsquo;s a shirt, the color may be made different, but it&rsquo;s still a shirt, it still has sleeves, still has a yoke, still a front and a back. See the form may be a little different, it&rsquo;s still got a collar, front, yoke, and everything but it&rsquo;s still classified as a shirt. This is what we&rsquo;re trying to understand, don&rsquo;t get carried away that one Master is greater than the other, they&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s kinda ridiculous to say one Master is greater than the other. Once you have arrived in God realization there is no difference, but they may have different roles of work to do, they may have different responsibilities, this can only be the difference in them. As far as the realization goes, there is no difference in the realization. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Again this is another misleading thing because are some people loyal to the form of Jesus and they wouldn&rsquo;t accept your modern, present Masters in their form? Now is the life in this present Master any different than the life that was in Jesus and any different than the ant that crawls on the ground? The current in this building passing through so many different watts of bulbs, still 110 volts but one bulb may have 30 watt, 50 watt, 80 watt, 100 watt, it don&rsquo;t make any difference, it&rsquo;s still the same 110 volts gotta pass through all of them so there again is the conflict in the questions. Audience: Is what you&rsquo;re loyal to loyal to the truth rather than any particular Master anyway? Adano: The truth is (Adano laughs) these things is what makes people get tied up in and lose sight for what they&rsquo;re searching for or what they&rsquo;re aiming at. There&rsquo;s only one truth, the road from birth to death and the life after the body form and the one truth is how to behave in a human body and how to realize the life principle this body is held up by, there is no other truth. Now whatever human being can make you aware of this, that individual you have some respect for but not the individual in himself because the individual himself still has to discover this for himself. It&rsquo;s the principle behind the individual that you have the respect for, you respect the person for having made the attempt to achieve this realization. See my respect for Charan Singh and Kirpal Singh and all these Masters is not because of their body, my respect is the fact that it&rsquo;s a human form that made the accomplishment which I am part of, this is my realization, this is my respect. My respect is not that I worship the man, I worship the principle which has come down and used a physical frame to make an example of Itself. Therefore it&rsquo;s the principle behind that is the thing you are thinking of all the time, but you need some reference point. So (Adano laughs) I&rsquo;d like them all to come in the room, not just one, I welcome them all, you see? My loyalty is to all of them, not to one, for me, I don&rsquo;t know for you, for me I love them all equally, I welcome them all equally because in their own words, I have to take their own words, &ldquo;The things I do you shall do also and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; Now one, the first statement, they have established equality. Two, they have made me conscious of my own God nature in that one statement, &ldquo;The things I do you shall do also,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s equality &ldquo;and greater things shall you do&rdquo; which is that each one must realize his own God nature sooner or later, not just to look at Him from a state of equality and then eventually turn down and want to worship Him, even Jesus who says &ldquo;get thee behind Me Satan, thou shalt have no other gods before Me.&rdquo; Not Me Jesus, before the principle &ldquo;thou shall have no other graven image or form before the principle,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the principle that you&rsquo;re looking at, this is the loyalty, this is where the real loyalty lies because the frame is the instrument you have to work with and the loyalty is to recognize that through this physical frame, a principle decided to make itself known. This is a respect for a living Master, not the man himself, the fact that living Masters will always be with us. It&rsquo;s not the end-all or the first-all, one Master comes and&hellip; living Masters will always be with Man because living Masters are an example of the principle in flesh. Audience: Adano is it helpful to think of that living Masters as reference point so when you think of Him, you automatically think of the principle behind it? It&rsquo;s a little difficult to think about an abstract principle. Adano: Yes, that&rsquo;s why Jesus used the thing you see, &ldquo;I am the advocate, the I-AM principle, you see Me, you see the Father, and this is the way of rightousness.&rdquo; These were all incentives to help you to bridge between the abstract and the human part of your nature. 0:10 You see we need some example so we labor under the condition that we have a Soul and we are searching for divinity. Now not knowing that we are Soul, we can&rsquo;t bridge this condition, now seeing someone who knows he is Soul, this someone helps us by example to bridge it. Now whatever incarnation that someone comes in, it is still the principle behind it that is bringing you back, you see it is not so much the form. If you say Master Charan Singh&rsquo;s body, in this incarnation they call him that, he might have another name in another incarnation, that&rsquo;s not the question, the question is that wherever this principle would make Itself manifest as Soul to those who think they have a Soul, this principle will have to use flesh or a form to shock us to the reality that we are Soul. It would have to take that physical form to break this concept in us so our loyalty, our respect goes to that period where this association is. I know it&rsquo;s a difficult thing to adjust to but we all want something tangible to hold onto and we can&rsquo;t seem not to want the tangible and to live with the inner consciousness. You see the Master will point out to you that you have to meditate, now many of us can write and ask for initiation, but doesn&rsquo;t He not tell you to meditate and read His writings? Why would the Master Himself, if He is the human form, why would the human form tell you to meditate or read His writings if initiation be the only thing there? It isn&rsquo;t the initiation or not being initiated or being initiated that is going to make the person change, it is the individual who has to meditate. You can be initiated now by the Master and if you don&rsquo;t meditate, the initiation isn&rsquo;t doing you any good. Put food in front of someone who has just eaten a meal, is he going to eat? He&rsquo;s not hungry, until you&rsquo;re hungry you would eat, so what the Masters are saying that if we understand that we have to take this process of meditation on an individual basis, we have to approach it as a day-by-day transformation of our nature, then through their intercession by the initiation, they can bridge now the form with the abstract, they can bridge the possibility of you comprehending the Divinity in flesh or appreciating Divinity in flesh, it&rsquo;s possible for them to help you bridge this condition. Now in my own case, I didn&rsquo;t go to see Yogananda, but I realized time and place would not separate a Master from the disciple getting initiation. Lahiri Mahasaya had such a man too, there was a man who couldn&rsquo;t see Lahiri Mahasaya, yet Lahiri Mahasaya appeared to him one night and He initiated him and that was it, the man was doing his meditation. It&rsquo;s the meditation that sets up the field, that sets up the necessary conditions to draw the Master to you, He cannot come to you if you don&rsquo;t setup these conditions for Him, He can&rsquo;t impose, He&rsquo;s not a type of consciousness that would impose upon another person, He doesn&rsquo;t impose wisdom on a human being. The radio transmitter or TV transmitter does not impose upon your machine and flip it on for you to look at it, unless you don&rsquo;t turn on your own set in your house, it ain&rsquo;t gonna come in, it&rsquo;s going to be there all the time broadcasting 24 hours a day, but until you make the necessary adjustments on your set to bring it in, you would not make a contact and it is the same thing with the Masters. Until you decide to meditate and pull this consciousness, They don&rsquo;t come, now They will come in as soon as you make the adjustment and once you&rsquo;re on their beam or their channel then you&rsquo;re hooked into Them and that is what initiation is supposed to represent for you, yet you are hooked into Their particular frequency. Now let&rsquo;s say you turn the TV set on and you don&rsquo;t set the dial right, you set it in between 11 and 12 or between 7 and 8, are you going to get channel 7 or you&rsquo;re going to get channel 8, you know what I mean? You&rsquo;re in between so you&rsquo;re gonna fluctuate so the initiation is only to put you in line with that particular consciousness and channel so that particular frequency flows to you and that is what is called a link with the Master or a link with that channel, you&rsquo;re now tuned into channel 12 or whatever it is. When you&rsquo;re playing the set, you&rsquo;re not interested with the broadcasting studio no more, you&rsquo;re interested in the program that is coming through the set. Now when you&rsquo;re hooked into the Master, what you&rsquo;re interested in is your realization that comes out of it, the Master is there as the transmitter and the beam of the energy, but if you don&rsquo;t work on this realization as to where you are, you have the same thing, you&rsquo;re trying to use a Master as a rabbits-foot, you think of Him in some kind of a way that&rsquo;s going to solve problems. It&rsquo;s good to think that, I&rsquo;m not saying no, when you&rsquo;re in need, you call on a Master, but the Master is not trying to make out to you that He&rsquo;s going to solve your problems, a Master is adding comfort, in fact He&rsquo;s giving you problems to make you grow. He&rsquo;s going to pull the rug out from under you to extract the strength out of you, you understand? So if He doesn&rsquo;t do that to you, you don&rsquo;t know if you got any strength, He&rsquo;s gonna give you disappointments just to find out how much you love Him. The most disappointments He gives you, the more persistent you are to Him, He&rsquo;ll get so fed up, &ldquo;Ok, have it.&rdquo; That is what the mother does to the child that&rsquo;s always bawling all the time, &ldquo;Ok, here&rsquo;s the lollipop, keep quiet.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s the same thing, one who keeps molesting these Masters, sooner or later like Yogananda, He kept molesting Sri Yukteswar until Yukteswar gave Him the Cosmic Consciousness. See sometimes that has to be the way, sometimes we are only content with certain things. Now we have to meditate you see, if we don&rsquo;t meditate I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s possible, by the grace of God or love of God that you can have, it&rsquo;s not impossible, nothing is impossible with God giving you His blessing and pulling you out, but everyone that I&rsquo;ve read or heard of, they all meditated at some time or the another. Now you see I know it&rsquo;s difficult to think and each one is saying his Master or that Master is better but I don&rsquo;t see any difference in the Masters. 0:20 Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No no no no no, I didn&rsquo;t say not to the form, I says when you think of the Master you automatically think of form, but don&rsquo;t try to hold onto the form, think of the consciousness in that form. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well the form helps, don&rsquo;t get me wrong that the form don&rsquo;t help, the form helps if we cannot hold on to the formless, if we can&rsquo;t hold onto the Eternal Consciousness or the principle, the form helps us. Now Kay Manchester live here in this town and I went through this same conversation with Kay and she would see her Master in form everyday until one day she didn&rsquo;t see no form and she wanted to know what became of her Master and the Master showed her that He was formless and it wasn&rsquo;t the form that was important and then she woke up out of the dream that the form was important and she begin then to meditate on the light she saw inside herself. She used to see every form inside of the Master and she even told me this, the last moment she saw the Master like a seed, His entire face and whole body like a seed, move right out into light where the life stream was coming from and as soon as that seed entered the life stream, that seed broke up into millions of pieces, into nothing, and the Master was gone. From that day on she never saw the Master&rsquo;s face no more and she started to grieve and then the Master came and she heard His voice, &ldquo;I am life, don&rsquo;t hold on.&rdquo; Then she began to really meditate because it was the light she was seeing now for herself and I said to her &ldquo;Hey this is what I&rsquo;m talking about, that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t go and see Yogananda,&rdquo; then she says, &ldquo;Now I realize why you didn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s because when you see the form and that shock comes that the form has to be broken from your mental attachment, you begin to grieve so much that you don&rsquo;t want to meditate no more because you&rsquo;ve lost that Master form which now was something you were clinging to, you were not clinging to the thing that made the form, you&rsquo;re still clinging to the image, &ldquo;Thou shalt have no graven image before Me,&rdquo; the Eternal Principle, but it has to bring you to a point where it has to break you from it. So if it breaks you from the form and then allows you to experience, that&rsquo;s why Jesus says, &ldquo;The things I do you shall do also and greater things&rdquo; meaning that you will eventually see this light, this consciousness as being responsible for you. It&rsquo;s a big difference, it is a thing that causes you to exist, you are the result of this thing so this is what is the real Master, this is the real Master, the Life / God itself, but the human form eventually brings you there by this slow process of bringing you to it and this was her own personal experience of seeing it in herself and she then realized, she used to see Him physically, a human body, then gradually she said it shrunk and shrunk and became a seed and just a head only in this seed, and went back into the pure life current where it came from, it burst itself into millions of pieces of light, she said from that day on she never saw the form no more, she began to grieve. Audience: I imagine in the early stages this was a sort of comfort in a sense, being able to see the form itself, I mean there is a personal implication. Adano: Yes, you see the thing is this, once you are initiated by a human Master and the human contact and the love and the affinity and the joy of communion, you want that because remember this, we are all part human. Don&rsquo;t get this wrong, there is respect for this form, there is a love, there is a gradual attachment growing there too. Now you see this thing inside of yourself and when you&rsquo;re not with the person, the only thing you have is a photograph to remind you of the person, of your association, you may have a few recordings of their voice you understand, to remind you of that association, but then you try to go inside here and you try to see a mental picture of what they would look like, so you&rsquo;re still holding you see. Now remember these are all essential ways to gain strength, there comes a time when the strength has to prove itself, is it the form that maintains the strength or is the strength maintained by the Divinity that is going to come into you? You see what I mean, where are you really going to get your strength from, are you getting your strength from the form or are you getting the strength from the Divinity? If you&rsquo;re getting your strength from the form, then you&rsquo;re in for a big surprise because it&rsquo;s going to let you down, it&rsquo;s gonna come a time when it&rsquo;s going to break up and there will be no form to rely on, you see, and that&rsquo;s why you say the form is gone now, but what is left for you is the Divinity to face, your own Divinity, your own consciousness. Now what has been planted in your mind through that form, what that form has passed onto you in some tangible way in voice, in expression, in human contact, this will stay with you, this will nourish your love and this will help you to hold on now to the pure Divine Presence until this Divine Presence starts taking over you yourself and then you will find that your Guru now or a spiritual Master is far more alive with you than ever before. Now Kay told me this herself, she says now she appreciates her own Guru for the first time because she doesn&rsquo;t have to see Him, but she knows His consciousness passes through her for the first time. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano, one thing I just couldn&rsquo;t understand and was trying to figure out ever since last summer was when you said forget about everything else and just pray to the form. Adano: Well I was trying to break you off from certain things in order to get your consciousness&hellip; See I told you &ldquo;pray to the form&rdquo; knowing it&rsquo;s like you say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t eat the fruit in the garden&rdquo; and I knew you would not pray to the form so I says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pray to the form&rdquo; which I knew you would have to pray to the form. (Laughter.) How am I going to help you across the barrier? You see to tell you what to do in order for you not to do. What I want you to do would not openly help you see, you have to put the consciousness in such a way it will refuse to do in order to do. So it helps the person, the person doesn&rsquo;t know they are being helped until they do it and then they see they have been helped to get to that point. So you begin now to realize that both are essential, but both are have their places and eventually it falls into place that the form has a place in your growth and the formless, or no form, eventually is the end of the growth, but how are you going to help a person to make this adjustment only by the cat and mouse play of the consciousness. That&rsquo;s why God did that to Adam and Eve, this interplay, how are we going to make this change, you see? To say not to do in order to do, this is a technique of how to get the person across that barrier, but you see you got past it, you&rsquo;re ok now inside. Audience: So should I forget about (inaudible then laughter). Adano: Yes, every Master does that to every student, you see the Master&rsquo;s way of teaching is not written down in books, it&rsquo;s an interplay between their consciousness and your consciousness and in certain ways they don&rsquo;t even make you aware of it lest you react too violent to it. It&rsquo;s after years of meditating and seeing, like Louise would say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a dirty trick they&rsquo;re playing on you everyday.&rdquo; I like the way she puts it, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a dirty trick they&rsquo;re playing on you&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s in order to get you across what you don&rsquo;t want to get across, but this is essentially what it boils down to. 0:30 They&rsquo;re helping you to get across certain psychological barriers or obstacles which normally we would not attempt to get across, you follow me? We wouldn&rsquo;t even make the attempt because we know of the complications, so they present it such a way that it would appeal to us so that we do make the attempt in regard they know where we are going is where they want us to go and we don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s where they want us to go in the first place, but if they told us to go there outright, we wouldn&rsquo;t go. I remember one time Master Yogananda said in one of His writings to some student, &ldquo;If I told you to go that way you wouldn&rsquo;t go so I&rsquo;m giving you the candy to go this way.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s holding the candy this way, the way he really wants the boy to go. So by not making it too harsh, He has to sugar coat it to get him across the psychological problem. It is a way in which you help the person because remember you tell somebody to do something and this is a human brain, it&rsquo;s a human mechanism, there&rsquo;s two things he&rsquo;s gonna do, resent it right away because he feels he&rsquo;s being imposed or he do it just to please you, not really to please himself. Now which is it, to please you and not to please himself, he doesn&rsquo;t learn anything, he resents it, he doesn&rsquo;t learn anything, but if you&rsquo;re trying you can get him across these two conditions by putting it this way and wanting him to go that way or pulling him this way to make him go that way, sooner or later he&rsquo;s going to be so confused, he&rsquo;s going to go where you want him to go in the end and he&rsquo;s going to break the concept in himself. He himself is going to break it, he&rsquo;s going to see the obvious thing and so he breaks the situation and he&rsquo;s free. This is what they call psychiatry too you know, psychiatrist does the same thing when they want to help the person past a certain problem they have to help them that way and it&rsquo;s a good way too. Now you see in the olden days they used to have confession, they say confession is good for the soul so at night when the sisters and the brothers all finish their work, the Sister Superior would be sitting down on her tail there and all the sisters would come in and they&rsquo;ll prostrate themselves and beat themselves on the chest, &ldquo;I was a naughty girl, I look at Sister Mary this morning and I could have stepped on her corns&rdquo; and the other says &ldquo;I wish I would have dropped the hot water on your head.&rdquo; Well they&rsquo;re making confessions, good for the soul, they&rsquo;re getting rid of their animosities in front of a third party, or a second party. Well it&rsquo;s the same way, in a way it&rsquo;s a way of how to make adjustments mentally to yourself, which is mental health, you&rsquo;re achieving the mental health you want, you&rsquo;re achieving the direction of consciousness. Now remember this, when a Master comes into your life and He grants you the initiation, He takes you up to a level to where you can stand on your own. Right now none of us can say he can really stand on his own in his inner consciousness because we are still trying to realize ourselves, we are not Masters yet, I&rsquo;m not a Master, I&rsquo;m still trying, I&rsquo;m still a disciple that&rsquo;s trying to realize myself but it&rsquo;s through the meditative process you discover what is your shortcomings, you discover where you are, and this the the gist of experience you are passing on to the next person to help him across the barriers. Now a Master comes along, he had to meditate too you know, He didn&rsquo;t just overnight get it, He has many lives of incarnating and meditating He solved these problems too within Himself and He is helping you to get across to a point where He knows now that you will have to eventually stand on your own. That why I say Jesus when He said, &ldquo;The things I do you shall do and greater things shall you do.&rdquo; That is, He is establishing equality with you and then He&rsquo;s establishing the God-ness within you and you begin to realize what they are trying to do. Once you begin to realize what they are trying to do, then you cooperate with the form, but you don&rsquo;t grieve when the form is gone now. Remember the disciples of Jesus began to grieve, even they were caught in the form too you know, they grieved and they had to come out of the form eventually, like Paul he came out of the form and he realized that the thing was the Christ-self. That&rsquo;s why Paul&rsquo;s writings today, now it&rsquo;s what the church has accepted to be the whole gist of Christianity because he was able to break away from the form into the pure truth you see but they haven&rsquo;t really investigated the writings of John because John is strictly personal experience from within, this is the revelation, that&rsquo;s why John in my thinking is superior than Paul&rsquo;s writings. Paul&rsquo;s writing was colored in this aspect or was slanted because he was dealing with Greek and Roman environment therefore he concentrated on a Greek / Roman audience in his writings but John was not, he was writing strictly from what went on within himself and what occurs within everyone&rsquo;s self and he showed what occurs in us is strictly abstract, it&rsquo;s strictly impersonal. That&rsquo;s why he says &ldquo;in this throne of consciousness&rdquo; right here and that&rsquo;s why his very first statement of his writings was&hellip; he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;when God the Father made the Earth,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; he made it very clear and straight as an abstract principle, &ldquo;And the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt in Man.&rdquo; He hit out every aspect and made us conscious of what we had to live with, you see then he went on into his revelations revealing the seven levels or chakras, making us conscious that we have an electrical anatomy that deals with our makeup and that this was our Divinity we had to turn to eventually, we had to go back to this Divinity, that this Divinity was already established for us and he also made us conscious of the fact that Master, the attitude of a Master&rsquo;s life was the key, that his Master Jesus showed the attitude that was necessary to go inside and that was the key. That attitude was the necessary key, those 12 Beatitudes were the necessary keys or the necessary way to look inside. See and that is why we find that he is more specific in telling us today how to apply meditation in our lives because the object of the meditation is to see this electrical nature of ourcells (ourselves). Now there is no loss, the gentlemen think when you go inside you lose everything, it kind of ridiculous, what you gonna lose? If God already made you this way, what are you going to lose? He made you as a physical form, He made you in electrical form, and He made you as an ideational form, all you&rsquo;re gonna see is shirt, undershirt, and underpants. You discard it, you&rsquo;re back where you are in your birthday suit so when you break through the three levels of your make-up: physical level, electrical level or astral level, idea level, you see yourself as pure life. This is what the Master of Kay was showing her in herself, He was showing her that see too had to return to the pure light, she broke through these levels and she saw for herself what He was passing through. Audience: And it&rsquo;s true all the time, it&rsquo;s just your realization of it. Adano: Yeah, he asked me a question, he says &ldquo;if I know I am God does that destroy anything?&rdquo; What can it destroy, there&rsquo;s nothing to lose. 0:40 Knowing God is the fact that you discover for the first time that you are a human being, until that time you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re a human being, you&rsquo;re still always laboring under some illusion, you don&rsquo;t appreciate the human-ness of this mechanism. The human-ness don&rsquo;t mean its fragility, most people think because you&rsquo;re human you&rsquo;re fragile you know, it&rsquo;s untrue, in the human structure it&rsquo;s written in the Hindu scriptures they say &ldquo;even the angels envy it because they would like to experience birth in it in order to praise the Lord.&rdquo; In the Hebrew scriptures they say the same thing, &ldquo;blessed is the birth of the Soul in the body.&rdquo; So if the angelic beings who want to have an experience of choice, an experience of feeling the human-ness of their nature, we can only appreciate this when we discover God in ourselves, we don&rsquo;t really appreciate the human-ness until that time because that&rsquo;s the first time you become a natural person. You see spiritual realization is not a holier-than-thou attitude, you see the spiritual people as they fully are, they&rsquo;re the most natural people in the world, so natural that you&rsquo;re just rushing out to help them, you think they&rsquo;re helpless people but they&rsquo;re not. It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re natural, their simplicity, their joy, they&rsquo;re flowing. I think there was one such gentleman who came to your other house, Sri Ram from the theosophy, wasn&rsquo;t there a naturalness flowing out of the person? That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to say, this is a natural flow then you see the human-ness of the thing, you begin to see for the first time with the naked eye that the Divinity is human, not that there&rsquo;s some human being sitting on a throne, this is what we must not get confused with, when we use the word human that it&rsquo;s somebody sitting on a throne, we&rsquo;re not talking of that. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t that word HU mean God or stand for the God-man? Adano: It&rsquo;s a Mexican word too, you see the Mexicans their high priests were called the Hu and then there&rsquo;s a place in Thailand where there&rsquo;s a tribe called the Hu tribe. Audience: Well somewhere I picked up the idea that this H-U represented something higher than just man at the animal level and that when you put them together you had more of a connotation of aGod-man. Adano: Well look at it another way, instead of say H-U let&rsquo;s call it Hew, what would we call Hew? Audience: Cut out or hewn? Adano: Right, you&rsquo;re hewing out for the first time Man, the Divinity is hewing out or chiseling out for itself Man out of this condensation of Consciousness and Energy, it&rsquo;s hewing out this Man, &ldquo;Man ought to be perfect like his Father in Heaven.&rdquo; In other words it&rsquo;s chiseling out or chopping out or carving out out of organized matter, Man, in his purest natural state. Now the closest thing we can see of Man in his purest natural state is a baby just born, we see the pure innocence, but let&rsquo;s take this extended form of the baby now and extend it to full growth without any defiling of its mechanism when there&rsquo;s no impurities coming in, physical, mental, or otherwise and we see the same naturalness, it&rsquo;s flowing back to that person. Then we realize it has been hewed out of the organism, this particular condition has been hammered out and the Guru is one who lifts you out or makes you conscious of it in yourself. Audience: It seems as far as the mind is concerned, you wonder if your inability to make it an integral part of your cellular structure so that you feel it all the way through and operate each day from this premise, but we get lost in our old ideas somehow I guess because they&rsquo;ve been so deep seated. Adano: Yeah, you see the process is a beautiful process, this process of meditation, it&rsquo;s so beautiful, each level is so beautiful that we don&rsquo;t begin to realize how beautiful this growth is from level to level. Every little ache, every little pain, every little disappointment, every little challenge is a beautiful process because what is it really trying to accomplish? It&rsquo;s trying to accomplish inner strength in us and inner peace, well it can&rsquo;t do it without that, without those conditions, we could never really make it without those conditions. Now it&rsquo;s not making for miracle because if we were making for miracle the whole of life is a miracle. It has been proven and shown that the closer you are to the natural state of life, the more nature around you respond to your thinking. The closer you live to the naturalness of yourself anything you should think or need, nature would seem to bring it into manifestation quicker. Now Yukteswar put it another way, He says &ldquo;The deeper the realization of the man, the greater is his influence on nature&rdquo; or creation. Now what is the deepness of his realization that would produce this particular power that would respond, what is it? It would only be that he would have to be living so close to a natural state, in other words he would just be a slight ripple on the ocean, he&rsquo;s not even a wave yet, this is the closest natural condition you can ever get on this water, you and the water is just vibrating. This consciousness would be so still and so natural that anything that would go into it will germinate and react and it stems from the very attitudes that Jesus was speaking of, &ldquo;pure in heart sees God,&rdquo; &ldquo;as a man thinketh in his heart, that is what he is.&rdquo; Now strictly it is not the organ of the heart, if this was the case, it&rsquo;s only because we have been conditioned to refer to this organ as the seat of consciousness, it&rsquo;s not the seat of consciousness. In the ancient days, they could not refer to inner consciousness, the location in the anatomy did not have a way to refer to it, they always thought everything had a heart and the heart was the central core or the important part of any object so by referring to Man&rsquo;s heart as the central core or the innermost portion of his mechanism where everything would be pure and sacred would be stored up in, they made that reference point to it, but in reality what is sacred and pure in Man is his consciousness, that&rsquo;s where it is you see. Now, but when they refer to the pure in heart in a deeper aspect it refers to something entirely different. The heart itself is an organ that pumps the blood and it decarbonizes the blood and throw off the waste products and retain the pure products in this mechanism to continue the circulation. Now this decarbonizing process leads to an electromagnetism of the cells and it leads to a regeneration of the human body. 0:50 Now the purification is what generates greater light in the brain, now when we do our Kriyas or naturally when me meditate at night or when we fall asleep, nature herself is performing this purification so they says that &ldquo;Kriya Yoga is a simple technique of decarbonizing the venous blood, and that&rsquo;s to throw off its carbon, utilizing the added oxygen in its atoms to transmute this body into energy, which is God.&rdquo; So when it says &ldquo;the pure in heart sees God,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re in a deeper aspect, we&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;when this mechanism, this heart mechanism, can by our conscious awareness decarbonize the blood, it will transform this body into pure energy or pure light&rdquo; and you would perceive this in yourself because this decarbonization is going on. Now, but it takes the mind to concentrate on it and it takes the mind to perceive it. Also it takes one very important ingredient, I think it is the only ingredient, we can forget the rest, this one ingredient is the greatest, it takes love. Audience: Yeah, I though that&rsquo;s what you were gonna say. Adano: We can meditate with technique and do all the techniques and still have no love and it don&rsquo;t work and you can meditate without the technique by the sheer love and it will work. Audience: How do you build that (inaudible)? Adano: &ldquo;Let go, let God&rdquo; they say or surrender, don&rsquo;t do anything, God will do it for you, but love Him. You see Jesus was smart, very very smart, He says above everything else just do these two things, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind, all your heart, and all your soul or strength.&rdquo; In other words if you sit down to meditate, don&rsquo;t have no other thought in your mind or in your whole mechanism but the feeling of love because with this feeling the Creator Himself is automatically drawn into you, He can&rsquo;t resist your love. If you&rsquo;re sitting down and an animal is here, I&rsquo;ve proven this, and just feel love, don&rsquo;t think of nothing else but love and I&rsquo;ve seen the animal just come over and they start purring and making all kind of noises to illustrate that they recognize love flowing to them, birds I see them chirping, I see the same thing, little insects. So I look at this illustration of love, I says &ldquo;well imagine the great Creative Intelligence with all the Masters walking around in the atmosphere, they got to come sooner or later.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why I meditate on this love, now Yogananda used to meditate, he said he used to meditate and pray for himself years ago, then all of a sudden he said he stopped all he prays is that &ldquo;may Thy love shine on the sanctuary of my devotion that I may be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts.&rdquo; He said that from that day on, Cosmic Consciousness was ever so strongly in his awareness, the feeling of this Presence was greater. From that clue gave me the other clue now what I should do, go back to what Jesus said, sit down and just generate love. Now in love there is no thought of the mind going to the past and there&rsquo;s no thought in the mind going to the future so the mind don&rsquo;t want to drift into the past, it doesn&rsquo;t want to drift into the future and if it drifts into the past there&rsquo;s no frustration because it&rsquo;s love, even the mistakes that were there, has to begin to love them now, you understand? And if it is drifting out into the future where anxiety will be, it&rsquo;s still love, see so there will no frustration or anxiety in the concept of love. You begin to see now why Jesus emphasized this principle as being the ideal in meditation. Audience: I thought I saw also, something came to me at least, what it meant that the pure in heart shall see God, but you&rsquo;ve extended it even farther than I could even begin to conceive of because far as I had gone it made sense that the pure in heart would see God, however I hadn&rsquo;t unravelled the other beatitudes. Adano: Well you see God is consciousness and life already and It&rsquo;s energy, now remember He&rsquo;s locked up in this mechanism, He&rsquo;s smart enough to slow Himself down and become this mechanism, He&rsquo;s smart enough to hide Himself in this mechanism. You know the Indians on the reservation when they make a blanket, they&rsquo;ll tell you there&rsquo;s one thread where they brought the Spirit out. See they&rsquo;ll start weaving and they&rsquo;ll keep weaving and going and they say when they weave, they weave with their spirit, their whole heart and feeling and they got the one thread, they call it the master thread, and you&rsquo;ll never find a knot. If you can find that master thread you can pull it and the whole thing will loose itself back into one long thread, if you can find that master thread, you can search the whole thing and still can&rsquo;t find it, but they know and they can come to it exactly where that master thread and pull it and the whole thing will come apart as one big thing. In Jesus&rsquo; robe that His mother made for Him, His garment that they couldn&rsquo;t cast lots for it, they couldn&rsquo;t divide it up because it was a master garment made with one thread, it will start unravelling itself. So Indians on the reservation they make their blankets like that and they have retained that technique of weaving this thing and keeping that one thread and it&rsquo;s hard to find, you would not find if you don&rsquo;t know where it is. You can search that whole rug and you think you&rsquo;ve found it but you haven&rsquo;t found it and they know exactly where it is and that can pull it and just start unravelling itself right back so they say they bring the spirit out through. Well the idea is that in meditation we have this same kind of a principle going on in ourselves that we can go into our consciousness and by the love itself pull this force in. Now again Yogananda said in one of his writings, he says &ldquo;Divine Mother will give you anything you ask Her for except Her love, but if She does give you Her love, She has given you Her entire self.&rdquo; Now that&rsquo;s quite a statement, Divine Mother is only an aspect of God, God will give you everything except His love, He wants your love for Him, He wants you to love Him, Jesus says &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind, heart, and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;God gonna love you,&rdquo; you understand? Now the Master says &ldquo;God will give you everything except His love, but if He does give you His love, He gives you Himself.&rdquo; In other words when you reach Cosmic Consciousness the love of God is coming into you, do you follow that? When the person has experienced Cosmic Consciousness, then the love of God is flowing in that person. Now it&rsquo;s a big difference to say that he&rsquo;s getting his prayers answered or whatever he wants will materialize for him because the love of God flows through a person, there are two distinct things the Master says you will know that the love of God is flowing through that person. One, the room is always flooded with a perfume, even if they&rsquo;re not there, there&rsquo;s a perfume will come, that is the love of God, it&rsquo;s like a perfume and the second one is the love of God is you will always see a flash of light and I&rsquo;ve seen this. 1:00 One time I went to visit Sister Dayamata at SRF and I couldn&rsquo;t get to see her because they told me she was in meditation, but I passed the room where she was meditating, just passed it to feel the vibration, and I can smell the rose perfume. It&rsquo;s a strange rose perfume, it&rsquo;s not rose, I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it, it&rsquo;s an unusual odor and it&rsquo;s a sweet perfume and it just flows through and you know that the Master&rsquo;s love, or God love, is just flowing through. This I realized how this love was flowing out. One night I was meditating when I was in the desert, I was meditating for a long time, I had already given up that this love of God would ever flow in me and I says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time I give up because I&rsquo;m not going to merit anything in Divine Eye&rdquo; and to my surprise I smelled this perfume in the room. Well I thought it was aftershave lotion, you know, Ithought one of the boys had aftershave, I start looking around, no, I didn&rsquo;t say anything I&rsquo;m sitting down and there&rsquo;s a fellow, a friend of ours, he doesn&rsquo;t believe in all these spiritual subjects and he likes to drink and he walk in, he says &ldquo;Adano, are you turning into a woman or something, you&rsquo;ve got perfume all around you?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;What do you mean perfume?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Yeah, I smell perfume. Did somebody give you a present or something?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;No George.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Man, this is very strong, I&rsquo;ve never smelled this kind of perfume.&rdquo; He had a glass of rum and coke, it was the funniest thing to see, he keeps sniffing and the rum and coke had no more appeal to him. He says, &ldquo;I can enjoy this kind of perfume&rdquo; and he sits down on the couch and he lost himself for nearly half an hour just trying to sniff up this odor in the room and I&rsquo;m looking at him trying to die with laughter because I know what&rsquo;s happening, this thing came in so strong. Well I thought it was my imagination, I thought it was his imagination because he was drunk, but in walk in two other fellows and they&rsquo;re stone cold sober, after a few minutes in the room, one fellow says, &ldquo;somebody got perfume in this room?&rdquo; I says &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well I smell it very strong, strange I never smelled perfume like this before.&rdquo; So when they went away I said to myself, &ldquo;Well I got the proof of what this Divine Love really is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not hallucination because if it was hallucination, nobody but myself would have the experience you see, then I realized that God does manifest His love, but He&rsquo;s very stingy with it, not every time you know, you gotta be a good boy in order for Him to give it to you. Audience: You get as you give. Adano: Right, you got the right answer, this is where I realize there is no something for nothing with God, the more love you give Him, the more He gives you back. In other words it&rsquo;s how much love you can turn loose to Him, that&rsquo;s how much love He will turn back to you and I tell you, you can meditate for weeks, months trying to turn loose this love, just to get five seconds of what He turns back and it&rsquo;s worth it. Audience: Adano don&rsquo;t you sometimes feel compelled to put it out from your meditation to let it flow through. Adano: Well if you do do that without Divine consent, you&rsquo;re imposing your ego again. See if you are generating love for God, you can actually sense when He&rsquo;s gonna release His love through you in that perfume, it&rsquo;s a funny phenomena how it comes, it&rsquo;s like when you wind up those walking toys and you wind it and put it and it starts to run? You can feel this energy being wound up along these centers in your back and then it comes out of you. Well I read where Yogananda, one of the Masters you know, He used to go into meditation and then all of a sudden He start to perspire profusely all over and this perspiration would throw off this perfume and then he comes out of it and the room is just flooded with the perfume and He mentioned too that when the Divine wants to release this love through the mechanism, you can feel it, it&rsquo;s being wound up and then it&rsquo;s released and this is why there is no part of our ego can get into it because the Divine don&rsquo;t release it through an ego mind. Mataji, Ananda Moi Mataji, the Mother, not the disciple, she put it this way, &ldquo;The love of God flows when there is total surrender in the mind.&rdquo; One man went to see her, his name is Bob Raymond, he&rsquo;s an SRF student and he stayed there for about three months, didn&rsquo;t get an interview with her, she was there you know and she was always in meditation, never talked to nobody, once in a while she say a few words in Bengali and then she was coming down the corridor one day. Normally you don&rsquo;t get to see these people straight off, they are there, you can see them, but you can&rsquo;t get close to them and she was coming down the corridor one day and he was coming around and they met and he said, her eyes opened up, she was like this, straight and looked at him for a brief second and then she spoke in Bengali and the interpreter interpret what she said and this is what she said, &ldquo;the love of God flows freely when you have total surrender in the mind.&rdquo; Then she kept on walking where she was going and he says from that day on it was a struggle for him then to learn this total surrender, it took him he said about a year of constant meditation and I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s very advanced, far more advanced than I can be, took him a whole year to reach this total surrender of the mind and after he achieved it he said, one night he was talking on meditation he said, &ldquo;If she had only said the love of God comes from the total surrender of mind if we love God back&rdquo; he would have achieved it the very next day, you follow me? Audience: No, I&rsquo;m having trouble right now. Adano: If she had said that the love of God will flow easier through the total surrender of the mind if the individual has love in that mind you understand? But she didn&rsquo;t say that so he was left to discover this a whole year on his own. So he said if she had continued and said, &ldquo;If you had love in your mind,&rdquo; he would have achieved the thing and I realize why Jesus said &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind and all your heart and soul&rdquo; because this was the key, I even had to go back to the same principle and discover that this was it. The mind can surrender and that this Divine Presence can flow if we keep building love inside the mind. In other words if we keep saturating our mind with love all the time, love, it flows down back to us, and that&rsquo;s why I said there&rsquo;s no something for nothing in this universe. In other words, you have to give love to get this love. Audience: The problem is as far as I can see it, I mean it&rsquo;s easy to say, but to do it is a horse of a different color. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You see when she used the word surrender, this can lead to this type of thinking as not fulfilling your part in the outward society, she did not mean that. 1:10 What she really meant you see, surrendering of the mind is that when you sit down to look inside yourself you should not bring the struggles of the day, the problems of the day in with you. In other words, do like the Japanese or the Chinese people, they leave their shoes at the door, leave the thoughts of the day outside of you now and surrender now to what inside has and actually to close the eyes and think love. See the love of having lived through that day to that moment of meditation, this is what she was trying to bring out to him, that very few of us live love in a grateful way or in a thankful way, we don&rsquo;t live love in thankful way, we don&rsquo;t exude it thankfully, like if it has to be demanded out of us. We seem to generate love because there is some need or we want something for our love, she said to him actually that this love should come out from us as being grateful of being a mechanism capable of loving. We&rsquo;re not grateful to the extent that we can love you see and that&rsquo;s the thing she was trying to bring out, if we could be grateful that we are capable of loving and the greatest center of love is God Itself where the love actually flows from, this Divine Love would flow back in, you understand? It is to be grateful to God that you can love Him, this is what the surrender really means, it&rsquo;s to be grateful to God that you can love God or that you can use the force of love to love Him or being grateful to have the opportunity to be in a mechanism that can love Him, you get the idea? This is what she meant by surrendering to it, is to let this force flow through you and you are grateful of the fact that you can be expressing it. See this is the thing, most of us are not grateful for the use of these forces, it goes so deep into our nature that we don&rsquo;t realize that we owe a great deal of thanks or debt to the Divine Creative Intelligence for having planted all these forces in this mechanism. Audience: I wonder if people generally have a realization that love is the powerful force it is. I know it&rsquo;s been written about, it&rsquo;s been talked about, spoken of in the Bible, all that sort of thing, but I wonder, it&rsquo;s sorta like various waves or energies that are existent in the invisible realm, we haven&rsquo;t realized they are there, we haven&rsquo;t realized the power. Who realizes really the power of an atom, I mean we know about it because the scientists have discovered it, but as an individual we don&rsquo;t quite understand what the power that&rsquo;s locked up in an atom really is and I think either through an experience or something only will we gradually come to the place gradually where we realize that love is a powerful force. I think people generally have gotten to the place where they almost feel mind power is more powerful than love is and yet we know, we&rsquo;ve read it&rsquo;s a mental thing we have been handed a number of times that love conquers all, love is the fulfillment of the law, and all this sort of thing, but I don&rsquo;t think really it has sunk into our concepts deeply that it is a quite the force and power that it is. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes it&rsquo;s true, you see realization is maturity of love, this is what realization boils itself down to, it&rsquo;s a matured love, you see. Now that&rsquo;s why they call it unconditional, matured love, it&rsquo;s not a love of being in love with someone or it&rsquo;s not a love to be loved by someone, it is love itself, the fact that it is love, it flows, we are in love with somebody or we want somebody to love us, but we just cannot seem to exude love or share this love or pour it out or give it because it&rsquo;s supposed to be given without demanding or regarding it or hoarding it up, until we can mature this thing. It&rsquo;s like aged wine, you have to store it until it becomes aged in itself or matured in itself, but you can feel this, this is something you can feel sooner or later. Audience: I&rsquo;m sure a Master doesn&rsquo;t have to put in any effort, but we have to put in so much effort to make love. Adano: Well the thing is you see, remember we put the effort to do things strictly because of emotion, not from devotion. Now the Masters they do everything from devotion. Audience: But don&rsquo;t you require effort to cultivate devotion towards them? Adano: But you see the thing devotion is also effort too because it takes effort to be devoted, it takes effort to surrender and deny oneself certain things in order to live in this state until it stays permanently. See like the Christian people have Lent, lean periods, you don&rsquo;t eat no candy this weekend, or all through the forty days, it&rsquo;s a kind of a fasting system, but this is a disciple, it&rsquo;s a form of denial, and it brings a strength into us. Audience: Well it&rsquo;s a practice that practically permeates after awhile and therefore I guess you can say it&rsquo;s maturity because maturity is that stage when we have perfected principles or when we have grown up, achieved individual status because of our own efforts and if you make the effort to love and exist because you demanded it of yourself for a long enough period, it becomes a permanent part of your makeup, and thereby invites to you the power love has. Adano: Well you see when you understand, if you hate you release adrenaline into your system so there&rsquo;s a definite chemical that is responsible for this result called hatred. Also there is definite chemical that is responsible for this result called love too. Audience: Well it stands to reason there would be, if there is for hate, there would be for love as well. Adano: All right when you love someone you light up, you glow, the only chemical that can do this is magnesium and potassium, you take it out of its oil base or its natural state and it will light up. So potassium and magnesium are vitally important because it retains a calming effect on us and at the same time it gives us this optimistic. We do eat a certain portion of those chemicals in our daily diet, but we&rsquo;re not too aware of it but it&rsquo;s there just the same. So who would want to adrenalize if they knew how to phosphorize? Phosphorous you see and magnesium, who would want to adrenalize if they knew how to phosphorize?  it&rsquo;s like a match you know, you light up. 1:20 Audience: Well of course the feeling so much more efervescent and so wonderful Adano: You&rsquo;re bubbling all over you see, but you see the thing is, the chemical result is there only because it&rsquo;s already been integrated and organized from an electrical nature and from an idea nature, it would never be there if the idea nature and the electrical nature did not select a chemical nature for its end result. See we are the result of a chemical nature too because we are looking at a composition of chemicals, there are certain minute quantities and larger quantities, but it&rsquo;s so integrated with this electrical counterpart and the idea counterpart that the moment the idea comes in, the idea of what, hate, it starts to set off an electrical relationship so your body starts to go through tremors and the tremors have to burn some chemical so it seeks the chemical that stimulates it so it seeks the one in that particular area of the body to release. All your emotional natures are setup the same, you see this Divine Intelligence organized this structure so uniquely that the thought, the idea patterns, setup this electrical movement that triggers off this mechanical or chemical movement so we are interlinked always. Audience: Every day I have a higher respect for this statement that we are fearfully and wonderfully made. For one reason or another something shows up, I saw a movie of just the physical makeup, how the bloodstream and the red corpuscles move and the white ones come along and attack anything that is of a foreign nature in the body. One just has the highest respect for the innate capacity of the body, you just can&rsquo;t believe it, it&rsquo;s almost a miracle to watch how the body functions. Adano: You see thing is we have not really evaluate ourselves, there was a time when this body was looked at with scorn and disgust, the flesh it&rsquo;s evil and so forth, that was the greatest falsity of philosophy passed on the human being, that&rsquo;s the inhumanity of human beings to human beings, until when the Master Jesus was in the body or any other Master would make a person conscious that this mechanism was the mechanism to work with, it still could not seep in, even today it doesn&rsquo;t seep in. We&rsquo;re so imprinted in our conscious so programmed to think that  this mechanism is incapable and once it&rsquo;s impregnated it&rsquo;s gonna take a long time to get rid of this incapable, but if you realize it that it&rsquo;s capable, that it&rsquo;s the only mechanism that has been chosen. Now this goes further, it&rsquo;s the only mechanism that has been chosen for Divinity to work with, He didn&rsquo;t choose no other kind of mechanism to work with. Now this is choice now, we&rsquo;re talking about Divine Choice, we&rsquo;re talking of freedom of choice. What other mechanism was chosen for Divinity? None other was chosen, this was the one that was chosen, flesh, &ldquo;Come let Us make Man in Our own image,&rdquo; this was choice now, this was a decision, &ldquo;and likeness, male and female create He them, and He breathed the breath of life into Man and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; So this was a definite decision, a definite choice on the Divine part to use this mechanism as the only media possible to work out the Divinity. Now one cannot recognize it until one begins to live with it, that the Divinity is not something like a superior being with a pair of horns you know, walking around &ldquo;beep, beep, beep, beep, beep&hellip;&rdquo; (laughter). The Divinity is the pure naturalness of love that flows and it&rsquo;s in that state that thoughts now can begin to materialize. Let&rsquo;s look at it this way, if you had all the gifts in the world available to you, but was denied the right to materialize your thoughts, which would you choose? Audience: Well I know right off, anybody going to start putting any inhibitions on my rights, I&rsquo;m rearing to buck. Adano: But you have access to everything in this universe, but you cannot think and materialize a thought. Now if you have the ability to materialize your thoughts, then you have exactly what the Divinity has because the Divinity is a result of a materialized thought, it&rsquo;s constantly materializing Itself. Audience: Well in other words then almost you are being and functioning as a miniature God, the microcosm is the macrocosm. Adano: Creator. You see we cannot escape the inherent quality to create, that why the mind cannot cease to think, it&rsquo;s constantly thinking how to create, it&rsquo;s constantly striving to create. It may not know what it wants to create, it may not even have an idea what it&rsquo;s going to create, but it&rsquo;s constantly striving, constantly craving to demonstrate its creativity, it doesn&rsquo;t know why, only because it is part of the creative structure. Audience: That is the thing, I think because if Man is made in the image and likeness of God, he has the same creative urge within him as God is creating&hellip; Adano: Right, God cannot stop creating see when He created the Universe He had to go on to create Man in order for Man to look into himself, see, so He cannot stop the process so He has left Man now with the burden of trying to create. In other words, God was smart, He took off after He made Man. He took a rest He said, &ldquo;You guys play My mechanics.&rdquo; Audience: That&rsquo;s a pretty dirty trick (inaudible) God is really ashamed that He ever started it. Adano: You see the thing is the Creative Principle must go on in the creation because that&rsquo;s why He says, &ldquo;Everything was made for Man, not Man for the thing.&rdquo; If Man was made for anything, he was only made to realize Divinity within himself as a creative force because every thing that he needs is already made for him, everything are here, right here around him. You know the idea of a rabbit he can&rsquo;t even take it out of the universe, just the idea that a rabbit exists, with all his creative ability Man cannot eradicate that idea out of the universe and he cannot add another idea to this universe yet. He can&rsquo;t get rid of the idea of a rabbit and he cannot add another idea to what is here already so he&rsquo;s caught in the principle you see because he would not know what to add that would be missing here and he would not know what to take out that would be short here. He couldn&rsquo;t take out anything and he would not know what to add, what would be missing to him in this universe? He doesn&rsquo;t know but the Creative Intelligence has left him with everything here already to play the game of creation, that is to realize himself, see are endowed with this creative nature now. Audience: Again you are just down to the plain realization, it&rsquo;s all here, it&rsquo;s a matter of just realizing it. 1:30 Adano: Yes. Now that&rsquo;s why you see the Master Jesus put it this way, &ldquo;The Sabbath was made for Man and not Man for the Sabbath,&rdquo; the things were made for Man, whatever it is Man needs or wants if he realizes that these things were made already for him, it will manifest now. The more simple and the more natural you live, the quicker these things will flow into manifestation. Now you would not have to create, you see the thing is if the Creator made everything for His creation and since the Creation could not remove any manifestation out of the existence and the creation cannot put in anything new within the existence that would add to it then the creation itself, which is us is left to play little Napoleons, marching around with a creative sword, a creative idea that we can create, but we don&rsquo;t create. What we&rsquo;re doing strictly as creation, we are rearranging all that is here to suit our needs, we are rearranging it to suit our wants and making a mess of it too at the same time. Audience: Is it true then that when what we are wanting is in line with the Divine Plan, (inaudible) and when it&rsquo;s in the opposite direction, that&rsquo;s where the messes come. You get into trouble? Adano: Right, what we need is actually in line with the Divine Plan and Will, what we want is not in line with Divine Plan, but if this was not bestowed upon us to decipher between or discriminate between want and need, if this was never given to us and if we were never given the opportunity to experience as they say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go here, go there, don&rsquo;t do this to get there,&rdquo; we wouldn&rsquo;t do anything you see, we would be strictly like this object standing here. Now this object remember is still stone, only you&rsquo;re looking at a different expression of that stone and because through the principle of change we impregnate this particular stone in this new shape. It was ore taken out of the earth which had to be melted down, then had to be extruded, then come out looking like this. Now it came out as ore and if we put fire to it, it will come back like ore, it will go looking exactly like it came from. So we realize that we are only rearranging these forces to suit our needs and wants. Audience: In our ignorance, we&rsquo;ve torn up the earth in order to try to create new forms out of the matter that exists in the earth and for instance in extending our hearing, we have built the telephone and we thought we had to have it because we didn&rsquo;t know how to go within and build the inner hearing but we built on the outside first only maybe to refine and beautify and throw the rough elements of matter into the refined elements of matter such as a telephone, microscope, the telescope, all of these things that are really extensions of ourselves, but we have to first find out they&rsquo;re on the outer then learn how to grow to the inner ones. Adano: Yes, this is true, this is what you are saying is true, you see Yukteswar wrote his Holy Science and in his Holy Science he shows that the external evolution is a proprietary movement for the internal evolution, one cannot work without the other but he also shows by no mechanical process will you arrive at total comprehension of your existence because you don&rsquo;t have enough lifetime, enough body form, enough disease-less atmosphere to perform this mechanical movement to arrive at total comprehension. Now, yet within the same body and the same brain mechanism, from an internal approach, we can have this total comprehension which is consciousness. Now the picture 2001 is a living example in photography of what Yukteswar was talking about. Audience: I got lost. Adano: You see the mechanical advancement and you see the slow methodical process it will take to go from one planet to another, let alone the entire galaxy, yet in the end of the picture you saw he bridged it by consciousness. Audience: Well you saw it, I didn&rsquo;t. Adano: You see it was only through consciousness did he bridge infinity and only through consciousness could you perceive what he was showing through photography what infinity was. Audience: Well I missed it. Adano: Well, you see the thing is this, consciousness was color and light and from Jupiter he says, &ldquo;Onward into infinity.&rdquo; Now the spacecraft could not travel into infinity because it would have to travel at the speed of light squared and you got upteen millions of open space out there, it&rsquo;s not going to come to no end, so the man if he&rsquo;s going to travel, let&rsquo;s say 80 years in space to go from one planet to another planet, it&rsquo;s not possible, but in consciousness he did it. You see when he opened the door, remember in the final part of the picture, it was a matter of argument between what the human mind is and what a mechanical imprinting mind would do, he decided that he was still a human being and that he could outthink and out-decide what the mechanical machine could do. So when the mechanical machine refused to open the door, he still figured a way how to get back in, he turned the little craft that was in and he pressed the button where the explosive bolts were and threw himself by the shock and the pressure back into the capsule. Now when he got in there, he still did not lose his sense of awareness, he was still a living creature, you understand. Now the computer could not reach out and grab him you understand? It could only have done that when he was outside in that machine which it did when the other man got out of the machine, he took the machine and killed the man, but this other fellow did not get out of his machine, this other fellow was in control of his machine and the other fellow made the attempt to get back into the second machine which he came out first by his own volition, showing that willpower is still there, through his own volition he then walked into the entire compartment and started cutting up that compartment, cutting up that whole unit. So he performed what is called a mechanical lobotomy on that unit, it&rsquo;s the same thing you would perform on the brain, he just cut back certain areas now, but when he was confronted with the realization that there was a possibility of life in space from what the recordings showed him, then the shock was too much for him. It came to a shock to him that he was not the only being traveling around in space, they had discovered some intelligent form of life that deliberately took a monolith and stuck it in the ground, as if it was deliberately stuck there, tremendous rays of vibration. This shock was too great for him and this broke into consciousness then it was all consciousness and he slipped away into consciousness. Now what he did experience was his three natures because he saw the three natures of the man at the end, you saw him eating like an old man, this was his physical body now back on Earth in his familiar environment, the things that you are familiar with. I said to that man there tonight, if you go into a place and you have no maps of where you&rsquo;re going, what you gonna find out? Just your familiarity is what you take with you, he was familiar with the bathroom, he was familiar with the table and food, and that&rsquo;s what the man took back with him. In infinity what are you going to take, pure consciousness and pure energy, you understand? This picture is a typical example of what happened, he had nothing to take with him in pure consciousness and pure energy but the familiar things he had to relate to. 1:40 Now the astronaut who was himself again looking at his astral body, see this was his astral body looking, this is the one that took flight into space, this is the one that we have that we know that can go away into space, it is looking at the physical body which is familiarity with disgust because it&rsquo;s so ridiculous to say here&rsquo;s a man with his pots and pans and plates and table and everything and here he went out into space and came back and it&rsquo;s all there it&rsquo;s only energy and motion, it seems kinda ridiculous to look at this thing as if you were seeing yourself you see. Now, then again he saw himself as a shriveled up old man, dying on the bed. Now this was the idea, he was Man, this is his idea body, there mere fact that he was Man, he was a living creature, he saw himself, the very archetypal principle of what he was, he saw that he was Man. You see, the cause of his being, he saw the causal effect that this had an effect on his own make-up, that this cause was him lying there and here was him eating over here and here is was in this astral suit, this spacesuit, his three self. One that was free to fly into space, one that was confined to related ideas, and here was the one that had a cause now, facing infinity, and what did they do? The causal body if you want to call it, reached up to touch what, the monolith as if to say the Creative Principle, and when it did reach up to this monolith to touch the Creative Principle, what did we see? An embryo came out, the infinity of life came out back, see what I mean, so the Soul which is again life, the principle of Soul, &ldquo;God breathed into Man the breath of Life and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; See the embryo was floating around in space looking for another location in which to come down again and start the whole thing all over again. So in infinity itself we can only realize this thing in consciousness, we&rsquo;re never going to realize this thing in a physical manner. Let&rsquo;s say 100 years from now we have families living in space in space trailers, they are like space gypsies now, and they&rsquo;re procreating and doing everything in space and living out there, still the planet Earth goes on. Audience: The same principles are in existence. Adano: The mechanical world will go ahead of the psychological world, but there is no way to resolve by the mechanical world the total awareness, there is no way possible for this because the first thing you have so many light years to travel from one galaxy to another let alone one planet to another, how you gonna resolve this thing mechanically in relation to your life? Now in that picture you saw they put three bodies in a state of hibernation or suspended animation, that&rsquo;s what you call Samadhi too you know, it&rsquo;s a form of suspended animation, and it&rsquo;s only a mechanical way of demonstrating Samadhi to the individual or suspension, and all the functions that went on was there, they were all showing within the mechanism. Audience: All the little lines and wiggles. Adano: Now they could travel in space endlessly without being affected providing they had some way to maintain the machine that they were traveling in and if the pilot didn&rsquo;t get old too fast, but we realize that the mechanical machinery could not bring home or resolve the awareness inside. It&rsquo;s an obvious thing it didn&rsquo;t resolve it, but what resolved it for that, what Kubrick was trying to show how it was possible to resolve this thing in consciousness was when he took a chance to demonstrate the survivability or the human body against the external pressures, how this human body will still survive under certain extreme cases of chance and how it will still exude it&rsquo;s ability to utilize its will. You see between the two craft there had to be a certain area of space that was not protected from the vibrations of that outer space because remember he had no helmet and the computer told him how is he going to get back inside without his helmet and without the helmet he has no way to breathe and survive, it&rsquo;s just like when your helmet underwater swimming if it comes off and you&rsquo;re too far down low, then not enough oxygen you&rsquo;ll get killed too you see, the pressure isn&rsquo;t enough. So can Man survive, can Man make the desperate effort to try to survive under such an extreme condition? Or would Man just give up there and never make an effort, but he never use his will to demonstrate one more level of his surviving capacities. Audience: Isn&rsquo;t this one of the reasons why we haven&rsquo;t demonstrated greater awareness and ability before and that is that we haven&rsquo;t been tested enough. We have existed in a very easy existence and nothing has put us to the test. Adano: This is true to a certain extent, we are being testing, I&rsquo;ll show you why we are being tested. We don&rsquo;t recognize how we are being tested and only because we have developed the dexterity to survive with we survive with that we stay alive. One good example is 50 years ago no automobile, you rode in a carriage, horse and buggy, and if you didn&rsquo;t know how to drive it and somebody fire a pistol it took off and it will turn over and kill you. So that was a challenge too in itself. Now, but in those days the percentage of such hazards were very low, they weren&rsquo;t magnified. Now along came a young man called Henry and his last name was Ford and he started a whole new revolution, he gave you 300 horses to pull your carriage and he called it the Mustang. So he gives you the asphalt jungle to drive on now and you get on this asphalt road and you start going to nowhere, real fast. Now your survivability and the tests are here now because look at how much reflexes you gotta develop. Audience: Well I agree but by and large I would say that our tests of ingenuity are really survival tests. Adano: Yes they are survival tests, I&rsquo;ll show you why. Even for a Master or any spiritual person it&rsquo;s a survival test. I&rsquo;ll show you in my case, I have to use my case as an example. I learned to drive in an automatic car, never drove in a standard stick shift, before these folks came back one Sunday to my surprise down comes a truck, stick shift, and you take back the car you&rsquo;re renting and you drive this stick shift. Now I never drove stick shift so I gotta go learn to drive all over now. Audience: That was a jerky drive I&rsquo;ll bet. Adano: Well they took off and the next morning I have to go to work, I never drove this thing, here I am behind the steering wheel and I&rsquo;m thinking what to do now. Either I drive this thing and smash it up or survive with this thing, here is the survival pattern again comes back, do I survive or do I give up right here and call the guy and say &ldquo;I quit work, I can&rsquo;t drive your truck, get another van&rdquo; or do I survive and learn to adapt to this thing. So I&rsquo;m behind the wheel and figuring it out the mechanics of the thing, can&rsquo;t come to a decision and I look at the watch, it&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock and the other guy is waiting for me to pick him up. So I says, &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m going to concentrate. I says &lsquo;Henry Ford you invented this machinery and must have drove it too, you can drive it right now. Wherever your consciousness is, however you invented this machinery, you&rsquo;re going to guide me to drive this thing.&rsquo;&rdquo; 1:50 All of a sudden I begin to feel, &ldquo;Well turn the ignition,&rdquo; so I turn the ignition and the car is in neutral and the motor starts revving up. &ldquo;Well go into first gear&rdquo; pushed in the clutch you know, shifting the gear, as you said it was a jerky ride. The moment I released my foot from the clutch, (Adano makes a noise), and it stalls cold. Well by the time I got out of first gear out in the yard to the first stop sign, I turned on that motor about twenty times, it stalled twenty times before I got to the first stop sign, I didn&rsquo;t even go into second gear yet (laughter), you can imagine somebody see me stalling in a brand new truck too, out of state, something&rsquo;s wrong but I went down the side of the road and I&rsquo;m driving in first for a long time, I haven&rsquo;t switched into second, cars are behind me I didn&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m going along in first gear until I get the hang of it, switched into second and then I start going. Now to stop, don&rsquo;t know what to do, pushed the clutch, turned the motor off, well survival is the thing, I stop it where no car would hit me so here is the other fellow waiting for me, he&rsquo;s across the street, he walked to the car and said, &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you can drive.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;no you&rsquo;re driving it.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you value your life, then you better drive.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Oh come on, it&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo; Well I says, &ldquo;you drive it let me see, maybe I&rsquo;ll get a better idea what I&rsquo;m not doing right.&rdquo; So he got in, he switched on and pushed, then I watched, first, went on to second, finally third, so I dropped him off at the workplace and there was another fellow with him, I said, &ldquo;Look you two fellows gonna work today, I&rsquo;m gonna spend ten bucks on two gallons of gas and I&rsquo;m going to learn to drive this truck before this day is over. The boss will pay for this gas because he says I gotta learn to drive this truck.&rdquo; So I spent three hours driving all around, but survival was the thing you see and you can see how survival plays an important part in bringing of pressure to bear. Now if it was not the survival principle involved, the responsibility now of having to take care of the thing, I don&rsquo;t think the pressure would come on. Audience: I don&rsquo;t think so either, but I do think that&rsquo;s an important thing in pressuring us into a financial reverse, bad health or something like this usually pushes us into a corner and makes us think for once what is the cause of it. Adano: Here is where Darwin got his idea of the survival of the fittest because the fittest are those who would adapt faster, the fittest is not the strongest you know, most people think the fittest are the strongest, it&rsquo;s not true. The greater adaptability the mechanism will adjust to, the more it will survive in an environment, but if it can&rsquo;t adapt no matter how strong it is, it will be lost. We begin to realize it&rsquo;s the adaptability, that why Man being such an adaptable creature can survive in so many different areas on the Earth whereas certain animals cannot, when they are taken out of their natural, they just die out. Audience: Well as hard as meditation is, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it was a natural thing. Adano: No, no, no, I agree, you must realize this is true, meditation is not a natural thing yet meditation is a natural thing. Audience: It&rsquo;s a natural way back probably. Adano: See it sounds kinda you&rsquo;re contradicting yourself, right, but it is not. It is not natural for the individual to want peace because his life is geared to action because his thinking capacity, his creative nature, strives for him to constantly demonstrate it, constantly manifeste it and therefore it&rsquo;s constantly pouring out, you know what I mean? Now, but he&rsquo;s creating or manifesting or rearranging creation that is causing hazards to his existence, is causing his chances of survival to lessen and diminish in the environment by his mistakes of wrong choice and wrong decisions, you understand? Now, therefore meditation would come very difficult to such a person in the early phases of his revival of his consciousness or revising his consciousness. Now it would be difficult in the first, in fact it would be an alien thing to him that he would have to shutdown in order for him to perceive his mistakes in order to make adjustments for his mistakes in order to now decide or act correctly, you see? That&rsquo;s why meditation would seem as an alien thing but as soon as he bridges or make the break, then meditation becomes a natural thing but it&rsquo;s that period in between, that is the period that is always so hard but as soon as you experience the peace and you experience the awareness of what is going on then this inner strength is there. Now you&rsquo;ll always find people who want to challenge your peace you know, instead of &ldquo;You&rsquo;re meditating, you&rsquo;re peaceful, let&rsquo;s see how much&rdquo; so they light a cigarette and touch you on the toe. How peaceful can you be then? You know this is the thing, once you start to go back into yourself and you don&rsquo;t conform to the conventional way of thinking, people begin to think that something&rsquo;s wrong so right away you are challenged. See this is one of the peculiar things about the spiritual life, if the challenges don&rsquo;t exist, this is where they exist, it exists when people begin to think what you are trying to accomplish is not what it really appear to be until you put it to the test. It&rsquo;s like a person wanting to drive, he&rsquo;s not a driver until he go and take an examination, meaning testing. So we find out that testing and repeated testing is what produces the strength, the challenges that make for strength, without it we don&rsquo;t have it. Now like in that 2001 picture, if that man was not tested to the extent to make the jump from one craft to another, he would not know that he could have done it, you see? He would still live under the illusion or the idea or the condition that he was limited in space. Audience: And that one vehicle was all that would do him any good. Well at last I know a little more about 2001, that thing went over my head like a bolt of lightening practically. I went to see it and I didn&rsquo;t know what I was looking at, I did part of it.</p>
<h2 id="1968-november---volume-4-guru-disciple-relationship">1968 November - Volume 4 Guru Disciple Relationship</h2>
<p>Adano68_11Vol4_GuruDiscipleRelationshipQ1RRNW6 - That is what you call the total surrender to the Divine Will of the Guru, never questioning him for no moment. Now the Guru at another incarnation is going to make you experience another type of association with him, that is the monkey relationship with his baby, the baby jumps on the monkey&rsquo;s back, holds on, that&rsquo;s the do-it-yourself attitude, and momma reaches out one limb here and one limb here, never letting go til she&rsquo;s got a one firm. In other words she&rsquo;s knows how to exist and survive, she fights the battle of life demonstrating to baby monkey how to do it. Most of us pass through a Guru-Disciple relationship like a kitten with its mother, we&rsquo;re being nurtured all the way through our incarnations, we&rsquo;re nurtured to God by divine devotion and divine help and intercession all the time, but there comes a time when you gotta take hold of the rein, the Guru-Disciple relationship, and you got to do the work. They can only carry you that far or nurture you that far, you got to finally stand-up on your own. In other words you gotta come to a stage where you gotta be master of yourself, no matter how slow and painful and how limited or how inefficient this mastery may appear to your consciousness or five senses, deep down in the inner self that mastery is going on far more profound than you can realize and Masters, that&rsquo;s their work, to make you conscious of this thing. You need that Sat Guru contact, I&rsquo;m not saying you don&rsquo;t need it, because this is flesh, this is the way of righteousness, this is the laws of right action that the profound effect of love of one being for another cannot be fully appreciated except by touch, it is not possible. 0:02 If I look at you all and I say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I still would like to reach out and embrace you, why? A mother reaches out to embrace her child, a child reaches out to embrace its parent, a lover reaches out to embrace the lover, the Guru reaches out to embrace the disciple, and the Guru reaches out to embrace God which is again another Master Consciousness and God reaches out to embrace us, but how is He embracing us? By human contact, by some form of contact. You can be meditating and God can reach out through you and make contact through you, this presence of love so intense as if to say you slide into an invisible glove that fits your entire body, of Divine Touch. One time I was driving through, in Canada, and I saw a little brook with water running, myself and Sonny, a friend of mine, and there was a little grotto. I said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop, it looks like a little shrine&rdquo; way out of the place. We came out and I went up into the little Catholic shrine, there were all kind of crutches, things, everything from people who had been cured and this water was there, and I reached down and I looked at the water and then I put my right hand and I took a little to drink. By the time my hand touched that water, I can feel the Divine Love flow right around like an invisible glove all around my hand and it remained there for days while I traveled from Canada to Mexico and all through that time it emitted a perfume and Sonny put his and it was the same thing and that very night when we were in Mexico, we were sitting down in the motel and from 12 o&rsquo;clock to 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning the whole room was just flooded with this Love like you were sitting, like somebody would slide you in an invisible plastic sheet of love, like if somebody was stroking you. 0:04 A cat appreciates love from a human by stroking it, a lot of men or human beings, would appreciate the same thing. The same when you go to meet a Guru, there were many disciples that sit down with the Guru and He would touch them, this is the contact, this is the Darshan that&rsquo;s going on, this is that human contact, it is there all the time, but what is to realize when this thing is taking place in the impersonal aspects, when all around you it&rsquo;s happening, you understand? Not only in the one area, then you realize that you have reached this conscious to understand what is going on,  this is what you want most. Audience: (Inaudible) do we go for the physical body and of course you go for the astral body (inaudible) this is where a Satguru in my mind makes the distinction between Gurus because the Satguru is able to not only meet you on this plane or the astral plane but can also meet you on all the other planes as a guide. Adano: Well let me explain something, we use the word Satguru, we must be very aware of what we are saying otherwise we gonna be fully confusing everyone concerning the word Satguru. There are only two types of Masters, a manifested Master and an ascended Master. The so-called Satguru terminology is an implication to mean a manifested Master, one who has achieved total ascension and realization in a past life and by Divine command has returned to take on the responsibility of bringing uninformed beings back to God through example. 0:06 An ascended Master does not assume that responsibility, WE are achieving ascended mastery, WE are the ones that are working to become ascended Masters, we are the sheep, there is only one shephard, therefore they can only have one manifested Master every so often in the world, but as we ascend into mastery and we assume the responsibility by Divine command, we will be Satgurus when our time comes. Now in spite of yourself and in spite of myself, God has already planned it for all of us to have our chance to be Satgurus. In other words, you&rsquo;ll get to heaven irregardless of how long it take, it&rsquo;s done been planned out, you cannot stay away from it, you will be pushed into it. So in each incarnation or each generation or each cycle of life, Satgurus or what we say Manifested Masters will always be there for us. This is the assurance we have, this is why when truth is returned to us or brought back to us, it&rsquo;s never brought back by an ascended Master, truth is brought back to us by a Manifested Master that is called Avatar meaning the descent of Spirit into the flesh again, God-Man. Now we ascend to the God-Man state first, in other words we must get our BA&rsquo;s in cosmic living in order to be MA&rsquo;s in cosmic living, you get the idea? 0:08 So a Master, when we turn the word Master, we are looking at someone who is already fully illumined. Now He&rsquo;s already chosen, a Master is chosen already, He doesn&rsquo;t come of His own, a Master&rsquo;s life is predicted long before He&rsquo;s born, that makes Him a Master in our sense of the true Master, His life has to be prophesized ahead of time, He has to have a specific mission in time and He is trained to follow a certain line of knowledge that is totally universal at all times. So in the Satguru, in the manifested Master of a certain line of Gurus, that life has been long predicted and that much souls of that particular affinity, or magnetic attraction, will be drawn back up. Now another manifested Master is being born of another line, He draws that much back because a manifested Master is coming back primarily to do what has not been done by the Ascended ones, you follow? It&rsquo;s hard to assess the manifested Master because He&rsquo;s an Avatar already. Now there are only two types of Avatars, or two types of manifested Masters, there&rsquo;s only one type of Ascended Masters, but there are two types of manifested Masters. 0:10 Now one type of the manifested Master, or Satguru as we call it, are those who are sent back into the realm of consciousness to bring back erring souls to the reality that they are Soul and there are those who remain in the resurrected cycle principle, manifesting and not manifesting, occasionally in that full body form, to disciples of a higher evolution and they are only strictly involved with the evolutionary nature of the universe and all its civilizations in various planets. They don&rsquo;t come out too much and when They pass on, They don&rsquo;t pass on as a normal being. Such manifested Masters go out of the body by performing Mahasamadhi and exactly, either in 24 hours, take the whole physical body and come back again and go about Their work and to their few advanced disciples, They will demonstrate that physical body to them all through time and there will always be one Maha Avatar who will remain on a planet to maintain that planet&rsquo;s stability in the cosmos. Each planet has a Master Avatar or a &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Master. In other words every planet has one of the Sons of Light constantly in the physical form guiding it, It never leaves that physical form. Master Babaji is one such Avatar, He remains in the physical form and when He was ready to throw off the physical form to be in the total cosmos, His sister asked Him, &ldquo;if there is no difference between life and death, body or no body, why throw it off?&rdquo; And He says, &ldquo;for that reason I don&rsquo;t throw it off&rdquo; and He became the death-less Master. 0:12 In other words for this millenium, for this particular world cycle, that Master is still in the body form. Now He has materialized in many forms to many people, I&rsquo;ll give you a little illustration in my own life. One time I had His picture and I wanted to frame this picture and make a lamp, put it in a lamp, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to design the lamp and I was meditating that night and all of a sudden I felt like I swooned and I fell asleep if you want to call it like that, but in that state I was totally aware and I can see all the pieces of the lamp precisely cut and measured, slowly coming down from a realm, I didn&rsquo;t know where it was coming down from like a white snow realm coming down, settling on like a golden table, and all the pieces fit themselves together. Next day I went out and got those pieces, but I went to buy the bulb to fit inside of the lamp and the socket and the bulb, you know these little sockets and bulbs, they have these nice sockets and bulbs, they were selling at that time at Wolworths for 25 cents complete, bulb and socket. I took the package up, one of them, and I hand the girl the 25 cents. She put it in a sack, myself and another friend were standing there because we were making the lamp together, she clipped it with a staple and she handed it to him and we walked out. We got home and we opened the package to put it into the back of the lamp and we found two inside, two bulbs, two sockets, we didn&rsquo;t pay 25 cents more, we paid only one 25 cents piece. 0:14 Now this I realize I&rsquo;m not the only one Master Babaji has done things like this to, I know another friend, he has done many things. In fact he&rsquo;s the only person I know that anytime he says, &ldquo;Babaji please help me this&rdquo; it happens without even trying and this man is not even attempting to be a full fledged disciple in any sense. When I met him, he had just overcome from a heart attack, he lives in California now and his mother, they lived in a high building, and he had a little rum and coke, but there was no ice and it was in the summertime and he said, &ldquo;Mumsy,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s an English fellow you know, &ldquo;Mumsy, we should have a little rum and coke, a little nip and tuck.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;Oh but George we have no ice&rdquo; and she was the only woman in the whole area that would have an icebox, everybody in the area has got a refrigerator. He says, &ldquo;Mum well I don&rsquo;t know what to do, what do you boys want, rum and coke?&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Yeah ok George, we&rsquo;ll go along.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well Babaji I need a piece of ice.&rdquo; He had just read the Autobiography, jokingly because I had said, &ldquo;You call on the Masters, They will fulfill your wishes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok Babaji I need a piece of ice.&rdquo; This is 12 o&rsquo;clock in the day and I laughed, jokingly, and he walked to the veranda of the house, it was open, and he looked down and at the stairway was a 50 pound block of ice. Now this shook him up for awhile, he came downstairs and he asked everybody in the neighborhood who that ice belonged to. Now he just overcome from a heart attack and he cannot lift objects up and we went down with him and he asked and asked for a long while, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t order no ice.&rdquo; 0:16 There&rsquo;s no car coming down this road with ice and if it does they blow their horn or they have a bell and he told his mother he says &ldquo;Mumsy, look at this ice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well George it&rsquo;s not ours because we didn&rsquo;t order it and the ice man doesn&rsquo;t come around today.&rdquo; So he says, &ldquo;Well if nobody don&rsquo;t pick it up in the next hour, I&rsquo;m gonna use it.&rdquo; Well you can imagine a 50 pound ice in the blazing sun in Montreal Canada about 112 degrees, how long can 50 pound ice last? It will be all melted out right? An hour past and that ice was still there, nobody claimed it so he walked down and he went to that ice and lifted it up. No sooner than he lifted it up, you would think there would be a puddle of water, right? There was not a single puddle of water, just a square outline where the ice rested and it was like a distinct line like if someone took a crayon and just marked the outline of the ice right there. He picked that ice up and started up the stairway. Well we ran down to help him, to our surprise it was like the ice was lifting him up the stairway, bringing him up to the top. Well I&rsquo;ll tell you, I drank the rum and coke, but there was no actual flavor in that rum and coke no matter how much rum I put in that glass, the ice and everything, couldn&rsquo;t get the flavor of the rum. I felt I was cheated after drinking the rum and coke because couldn&rsquo;t taste the flavor of the rum in the rum and coke. Well George says to me, &ldquo;Man this is too serious&rdquo; because he didn&rsquo;t expect something like this to happen. 0:18 Next day he ask around, anyway that ice lasted for quite a while in an ordinary box that they put it in but what was peculiar was this, from that day one he never wanted to talk anything about yoga and he didn&rsquo;t even want to see the Autobiography of a Yogi in the house. He gave it away, right away he gave away that book and I would go and meet him with my friend in the car and as soon as we got in the car, he would say &ldquo;Sonny, Adano, let me go out. I know you two guys want to talk about spiritual things, I just want to go and have a rum and coke&rdquo; and he wouldn&rsquo;t stick around, but this is a peculiar thing, we see him often and he meditates, but he says to me, &ldquo;Babaji has never failed me yet in all these things, even though He knows I&rsquo;m a wayward disciple, in some way He has never failed to materialize things when I need them&rdquo; and actually materialize them, he not saying that somebody come and give it to him, this is one peculiar part about it. So it is strange and as I say, you know you say &ldquo;I need a pair of shoes&rdquo; then before you go to buy the pair of shoes somebody says &ldquo;George I&rsquo;ve got a pair&rdquo; or something, somebody gives you something, you know bring you a gift, no. He make an outright statement, he says &ldquo;Babaji I need it&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s strange that he&rsquo;d find that he&rsquo;d come home in that apartment and there&rsquo;s a package right there, it got no name, nothing, but when you open it, it&rsquo;s there and this has puzzled him to this day and if you say to him, &ldquo;George sit down and meditate, really sit down and try to follow spiritual life,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m too long gone, if He can&rsquo;t help me like a pussycat, He ain&rsquo;t gonna help me.&rdquo; In other words, he&rsquo;s accepted the cat / kitten relationship with this Guru. 0:20 He says he knows he&rsquo;s reached that stage, He&rsquo;s gotta pull him out but the funny thing, he would meditate and he would feel himself all ready to go out you know, into that consciousness, but then he looks back and he figures the obligation to his mother, she old, and he&rsquo;s the only surviving heir and then he thinks of his two sons and then he says, &ldquo;stop this meditation, this is my obligation here first.&rdquo; In a way he&rsquo;s a wonderful person. Here&rsquo;s a man who would not lie, he doesn&rsquo;t swear, he wouldn&rsquo;t cheat you, he would borrow money and he would work to pay you back every penny plus and if he&rsquo;s got money and you ain&rsquo;t got, he&rsquo;d take out a check and says, &ldquo;here, you put how much you want.&rdquo; The only one thing is he says, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit down to meditate to feel that bliss, I need a rum and coke.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s the only vice they are going to hold against me for cosmic consciousness, well they can hold it against me&rdquo; and the funniest thing, doctors have tested him and he&rsquo;s not an alcoholic, no matter how much this man drink, it doesn&rsquo;t show up in the bloodstream, can&rsquo;t figure it out yet. He drinks a whole quart like that everyday and he does not wobble, you can tell a person is drunk, this man is straight sober. To him that is something necessary for him in this incarnation, in other words he&rsquo;s come to the realization that he&rsquo;s working out some last condition in him. 0:22 There&rsquo;s this peculiar thing though, you know I lie down to sleep in various places and I can feel the vibrations of people when they sleep, wherever they sleep. So I was visiting him and he says, &ldquo;Adano you feel tired, there&rsquo;s my bed over there, my mother&rsquo;s bed is in the other room, don&rsquo;t go there, use this one.&rdquo; And I go try to lie on his bed, it&rsquo;s like ants crawling all over the wall, could not get in, the vibrations were hard to get into this you know, but it&rsquo;s peculiar, with all that inner turmoil that&rsquo;s going on in those vibrations, there was a tremendous inner sense and purity of consciousness present in him which I admire so much in the man himself, I says &ldquo;here is a man who has the depths of being spiritually realized, only because he&rsquo;s committed in this physical form to a mother and two sons&rdquo; and this is the only turmoil that goes on and whenever he thinks of it and he thinks of the problem, he takes a drink. The thing that made him drink rum and coke, he doesn&rsquo;t attribute it to his problems, the way he attributed it was that when he had his heart attack the doctor told him&hellip; he asked the doctor &ldquo;should I stop drinking alcohol&rdquo; and the doctor says &ldquo;no, a little now and then is not too bad&rdquo; and that was what kept him going. Audience: Oh, he&rsquo;s an amazing person. Audience: A lot of people have to go Adano. Adano: I know, I kept you folks too long, oh boy. 0:25 (Gap in tape) &hellip;concentrating on the modern youth and adult who seek cosmic consciousness. See cosmic consciousness is God realization and great Sages have achieved this. In modern man, we want a do-it-yourself process and an instant experience, so we find we end up applying chemistry to ourselves, it has been classified as drugs in the modern society. The question has come up, can drugs produce cosmic consciousness? This is one of the biggest challenge to modern man, can it really produce cosmic consciousness and if the experience is really cosmic consciousness after you have tried it, then we must have certain tests that must validate itself over a long tradition of great Sages who have walked that path and live as testimony to that test, then we can say drugs can produce cosmic consciousness. But if the test that is presented for the man who has used it and he fails the qualifications required by that test, then the result is that he didn&rsquo;t got cosmic consciousness. Well tonight I&rsquo;ll try to show the similarities experienced by chemistry on the human body in relation to the experiences achieved by meditation and the results achieved by realized Masters on the path of truth. Man essentially is Soul and the Soul nature is joy or bliss and also omnipresence, Man does not have a Soul. I&rsquo;ve tried to make this clear to those who have heard this before and to those who have not heard it, we&rsquo;ll clear that point up immediately and then we can go on to why Man is experimenting on his body to find out. 0:27 The scriptures point out that God breathed into Man breath of life and Man became living Soul, it did not say that Man became a living body. So from that fact we have to work with now, Man is Soul, then the Soul&rsquo;s nature is joy, it can&rsquo;t be sorrow, the Soul&rsquo;s nature has gotta be omniscience, that is all powerful and demonstrable. The Soul&rsquo;s nature has got to be all peaceful or omnipresence, it doesn&rsquo;t limit you to this little ball of a planet, it involves every aspect of creation, also the Soul&rsquo;s nature is the eternal life in the non-corruptible body. Now Sages who have tested the Soul&rsquo;s nature and have lived the Soul&rsquo;s nature remain as a challenge to Man, like my thumb to my four fingers, apart and distinct. Now Man wants a shortcut method because he&rsquo;s caught up in his convention, his culture, and his language and time is running out to keep up with the competition, so the wise man wants to know more than the other man in order to stay above his fellow man, this is the complex condition we are involved today. 0:29 Youth is caught in a straight jacket from 0-1 to 18 years of age by conventional laws and the adult is caught in a straight jacket from 0 to 72 by conventional social security problems and welfare activities and the competition of survival with other nations, where is the man gonna have the chance to realize he is Soul. So he&rsquo;s confronted with a challenge, either to experiment by methods handed down by Sages or by pharmacology, that is drugs, so we must see the symptoms. One of the conditions of the religious life of Masters is knowledge that comes after the man has achieved consciousness whereby he can dip in to the reservoir of peace and take it out and use it. Also, peace is a natural expression of that man, he&rsquo;s living in peace, he isn&rsquo;t searching, he feels it, he lives it, he emanates it, and those who are involved with it can automatically tap into it, but it&rsquo;s permanizing his mechanism everyday and becoming stronger and stronger, these are qualities or conditions that manifest themselves in the lives of Saints or Masters as we call them, masters of life. 0:31 Now if you are tense, you need peace, but how do you get tense? It has to be something that interfers with the natural flow of your life. Now if from 0-1 to 0-18, this is age period of the restricted school child, the frustration cycle is so great that momma and daddy wants him to be top of the class all the time. Momma and daddy is competing with the next door neighbor at the same time, momma and daddy is never home at the same time, and the insecurities caught up and the widening association and transportation facilities broaden the gap of frustration and insecurity for 1 to 18, let alone for 1 to 76, you see what is happening now? So right away you get a headache &ldquo;geez I can&rsquo;t see the light, I can&rsquo;t write, I can&rsquo;t read, I need a Bufferin,&rdquo; but what is a Bufferin, is it something to hold back, to allow something to come through? Yes, best form of Bufferin, aspirin, our advertising is pushing it in on us, we are confronted with &ldquo;take the escape route.&rdquo; So we run to Bufferin right over there, drink it down, relaxation comes back, you can cope with the next frustration coming up. See where 1 to 18 alone is caught up in it, 1 to 76 is caught in it. Now every time the relief comes from the application of an external agent to allow the life flow to return to its natural stability, a central dependency begins. 0:33 Why? Because Man is a creature of habit, he soon develops a habit rhythm and cannot avoid his habit rhythm so normally he goes through the gestures of habit. Soon the Bufferin is not strong enough because the headache entails certain repercussions that become stronger and block the natural life flow of the mechanism, block the association with nature, therefore we need a stronger Bufferin, so we go back to the druggist, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make something to compress this condition or push it out, break it out, do something.&rdquo; So we go to the tranquilizers, it&rsquo;s another way of breaking up that tension, breaking up that dam, it&rsquo;s like logs is going down the river and suddenly they get dam up at the mouth of the river, logs can&rsquo;t move no more and we send down one of those log boats and they go and you move them and sometimes you break a leg because you slip, this can happen in the drug process of trying to break up a tension principle, you may overdose. Now the frustration level is so great because of the pressures at home, the competition and survival pattern, and the insecurities that are the result of one fallacy and that is we say to ourselves, &ldquo;an overdose would end it&rdquo; if an under-dose doesn&rsquo;t cure it, an overdose may end it so we take an overdose and sometimes that overdose is fatal. 0:35 Now again we are trapped, it&rsquo;s a funny thing to be trapped so hopelessly without any connecting link, without any reason of getting out, without any motivation &ldquo;what is it all for?&rdquo; Well the Sages state in their lives that Man is Soul and this so called trap is only hurdles placed in his path of life from birth to death whereby he would have an opportunity by trial and error, by conscious effort, to discover he is Soul. That doesn&rsquo;t matter if he doesn&rsquo;t want to accept it, these things are placed there for him to realize this eventually but they need certain rules or disciplines to follow that or to get out of it and these disciplines are the contrast to the quick relief by drug, these disciplines begin to teach you the nature of your mechanism, how it does function, how to utilize this nature so that you can work in the restricted pattern. Alright, youth is learning because they cannot help but learn in this restricted pattern and the professors are forced to teach, we&rsquo;re faced with the fact that &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do my homework, I can&rsquo;t keep up, I&rsquo;m gonna fail my examinations, therefore I will cram and will take all kinds of chemicals to allow us to stay awake to cram and if possible, we will cheat.&rdquo; 0:37 This is no discredit to no human being, these are conditions already setup therefore every human being, race, color, creed, for all nationalities of all creations in every planet of life, this is behavioral and emotional conditions all there, we are pushed into it, that is what is going to push us on. So we get stronger and stronger drugs to relieve the tensions that occur but every relief gives us a sort of semi-peace, a semi-second wind, a semi-form of alertness, it sustains us for a brief moment until we become dependent in a habit pattern and therefore cannot exert or generate from within the physical structure the natural life flow that is there that feeds the brain and allow it to really realize its true nature. The latest experiments show that these drugs that relieve tension and allow us to have some semi-form of relaxation carries certain symptoms that give us the false belief that we have achieved some kind of awareness, but we don&rsquo;t have no yardstick measurement whereby we can refer to because a school teacher is not a Saint. 0:39 In the second place, a disciple is not a student of the school, we would have to have measurements now to work with. Now the student in school when he breaks down the tension by applying some agent, some chemical agent to break down that tension, automatically he feels a sensation of relief and this portion of the brain is drawn and he feels like suspended. Now right across here the sensation of peace, because it&rsquo;s pulled back, can be felt, release it and you get back into the tension state. Now the drug will pull by intoxicating it, that is internally poisoning that situation or suspending that situation to relieve it, but it will not bring bliss, it cannot bring joy, it will give a tremendous amount of peace and relaxation, and it cannot bring knowledge or intuitive awareness. It can bring memory patterns, memory associations, it can bring ideas that we have refused to accept when we were not using the drug, it would bring them out to the surface and now we have to accept them regardless of how horrible or how beautiful they are. We are faced with it because we have given up volition, we have no more volition temporarily when the drug applies its control over this area of the brain, the alpha rhythms go in check. 0:41 Now this is no discredit to the drug, this is its purpose to relieve the tensions that are there, but to give the sensations or the feelings that you have a temporary peace. It doesn&rsquo;t say it is a peace produced that can allow us to live that way normally and allow us to focus normally, it is peace nevertheless but it&rsquo;s not cosmic consciousness, it&rsquo;s all memory patterns, it&rsquo;s not inspiration either. Now more advanced drugs allow us to experiment beyond the range of relieving a tension, achieving a relaxation, and possible trying to trigger some form of awareness and allow us to try to evaluate that form of awareness, what is it all about, but we don&rsquo;t have no yardstick measurement to relate it to so we are confused and the experimenter himself, having no yardstick measurement himself, he too can mislead you in the experiment and then you don&rsquo;t know if his experiences are genuine and if what you are having is genuine and permanent and workable because he doesn&rsquo;t know if his. He may only arrive at certain theories concerning that condition. Now the Saints don&rsquo;t theorize, they all teach one same thing all the time and they leave testimony with their bodies and we can use it as yardstick measurements. 0:43 So we have to use tangible facts to compare or set them up and see where the value lies and the methods employed. The student and the chemist or scientist will try now to find stronger agents to produce this sensation of peace from the relaxed state and the condition of heightening the awareness through the five senses, that is the sight will be more magnified, the hearing becomes more magnified, the smell, the taste, and the touch because these are the only five avenues that this mechanism called a body can seem to reach out and associate with. Now one having an experience under that particular chemical agent talking to someone who has never applied that agent to his body, there can never be a common bond of communication at no time and it&rsquo;s only natural that a parent and the child is going to drift apart. You cannot say because you drank coffee, tell me the taste if I have never tasted coffee, and hope I can accept it, what it will taste like. We both have to taste the thing and if we agree that this is good then it&rsquo;s alright, but if we don&rsquo;t agree something is wrong. So parents getting huffed-up because one section of their family life is torn for lack of communication cannot blame that party, they gotta blame something that is lacking in themselves too and they gotta blame the educators and the experimenters for having no yardstick measurement to validate what they are saying and Man is not going to tamper too far because he&rsquo;s scared of the survival pattern of his life and convention is not going to allow him to stay too long experimenting to find out if he&rsquo;s got the right technique to this understanding of himself without imposing safety guards, you see he&rsquo;s trapped again, society and man is already trapped in this phenomena. 0:46 Now the strongest agents so far discovered by Man that would present a measurement of awareness has been the LSD movement. Now when I use it don&rsquo;t try to belittle any youth or grown person or any individual, we are looking at this thing objectively and see what these people are doing or trying to do before we can objectively evaluate, the lecture being &ldquo;Does drugs produce cosmic consciousness?&rdquo; You see, so we have to have an open mind to what we are talking about to understand the value and the measurements and the possible way that cosmic consciousness can be achieved when the techniques are presented and when the agents are presented. Now this one chemical agent has produced by the action certain conditions, symptoms, and certain reactions. It&rsquo;s easy for one man to join another man after they cannot communicate to each other because Man love to huddle like monkeys, he cannot stay by himself, for the man out in the woods by himself sooner or later he&rsquo;s going to go looking for another man because he wants to communicate, this is his nature. Now a person discovering the use of the chemical wants to communicate, if he doesn&rsquo;t then something is wrong, that&rsquo;s the very origin of conversion and that is the start of the holy wars, even when the Saints taught the truth and gave Their disciples certain experiences in cosmic consciousness, they in turn could not stand the shock and wanted to convert some other individual into it and because they were not evolved enough in that consciousness, conflict began, it&rsquo;s only natural. 0:48 Now the chemist has left a chemical agent for Man to find out what his mechanism is to a certain extent and to give him a certain type of peace, a certain type of relief, and a possible type of expansion of awareness, but it did not say it gave the man permanent peace, it didn&rsquo;t say it gave the man intuitive development, it didn&rsquo;t say it gave the man wisdom, it didn&rsquo;t say it gave the man cosmic consciousness. Now here is a typical example of one of the tests that the Sages put forward of a person who has claimed that they experience some form of expanded consciousness or awareness by the chemical agent versus what they themselves have achieved through their own meditative process. There was a man who applied a chemical agent and had a tremendous extension of awareness and came to a spiritual teacher and said &ldquo;I have achieved cosmic consciousness&rdquo; and the teacher looked at him and said &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t think you have, I think you have found the whole topography or the whole geography of your subconscious mind for the first time and actually saw how it functioned.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no I have had cosmic consciousness, I have felt the presence of God.&rdquo; The Sage looked at him and says, &ldquo;Alright, if you have, we are here in America and I was born in India, there&rsquo;s a city called Calcutta, on Road Andrew Street is the name of the street, room 14 which is a store, there is an Indian man wearing a turban right there at this moment, he&rsquo;s selling sweetmeats, I want you now, right in your body here, don&rsquo;t go out of this room, send you cosmic consciousness to that man and let him give you one of those sweetmeats and transport it back into this room and let us eat it.&rdquo; 0:50 He looked blankly at that Indian teacher and realized he did not have cosmic consciousness and the Indian teacher said &ldquo;Alright&rdquo; and he reached up into the air brought his hand down and says &ldquo;Here, eat.&rdquo; The label and everything was tagged on the package and to double check they phoned, he paid the phone bill for the man to double check in India to find out if there was such a place called Andrews Street 14 and the man claimed that he lost a piece of candy, that some kid stole it at that particular instant in time. Now this is the biggest shock to that man and I would say, it would be a shock to anyone confronted with such testimony but this was not intended to frighten the man, it was only intended to make the man realize that claims pertaining to cosmic consciousness can be from certain levels or references not as valid as they seem and anyone claiming it would be hailed as a messiah, but the Sages are here to prevent such so-called false messiahs appearing, real Saints live simple lives like you and I, they don&rsquo;t go around shouting to the public, but whenever a principle of truth is challenged, they rise up to the fore, they are the St. Georges of truth, they face the dragon of ignorance and cut its head off right there confronting you with the fact and that&rsquo;s the end of the association, they don&rsquo;t talk no more about it. 0:52 Well the man once said to him, &ldquo;Then how can I achieve what you have done?&rdquo; and the Sage said to him, &ldquo;You have to meditate.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;but what is meditation?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well then this is an entirely different thing to what you have accustomed yourself to because meditation is a process of living, it involves living, it&rsquo;s not escaping from living. In fact it&rsquo;s taking on the responsibilities of living for the first time.&rdquo; So the man said to the Saint, &ldquo;Where is the scriptural truth of that?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well in the scriptures they say that one great Master came to teach the world and he said &lsquo;I have come that ye may have life more abundantly&rsquo; and in so doing He pointed out the relationship of life abundantly, not in terms of material objects, actual life flow not restricted by tension, not restricted by headaches, or sickness or illness, not restricted by frustration, but for the first time it can flow through the brain, through the senses, and can function in a material world and solve the so-called insecurities and instabilities of the existence.&rdquo; The man realized that he had to reevaluate all that he knew about his chemistry and what he thought cosmic consciousness would mean to him because he had one tangible proof in front of the Sage after the Sage had performed the act, he noticed that the Sage was serenely peaceful. 0:54 For days this Sage was in the same situation and there was no sense of tiredness, no sense of yearning or irritability, while he was constantly irritable and agitated, but he noticed at the same time the degree of his agitation and irritability began to diminish in the presence of the Sage because the Sage was always dipping into meditative awareness and was setting the stage for this man to recognize something was going on. The man, not using as much Bufferin or whatever it is to maintain a hold back on the pressure on his consciousness, soon realized that in the presence of the Sage, he too was diminishing the use. Now the Sage said to him, &ldquo;This process leads to cosmic consciousness and the first thing you will experience in it when you start off is peace, joy, bliss.&rdquo; Now the man knows a little from past experience what peace is, but he does not know what bliss or joy is, there are different degrees of awareness and experiences and feelings and bliss has a transmutation principle in it, it transforms the cells, it slows down the physiological aging of the cells while you chronologically go on with your calendar year life, whereas the drug has no such possibility because there is a slow deterioration and one can tell the difference of two individuals, the drug taker and the meditative practitioner, the slow loss of light and glow in the mechanism is diminishing. 0:57 There is a tendency to be dry, the skin tends to dry itself, there is a tension, there&rsquo;s a pulling of the skin, there&rsquo;s a tendency for retreat, there&rsquo;s a tendency to shutout, and there is no vitality, there is no sense of buoyancy, there don&rsquo;t seem to be a zest for living. Whereas the meditative man is full of zest for living, not involving to take away anything from anyone or possessing anything, he&rsquo;s alive, he infuses life where he goes. In fact, it is permeating everyone with it, it&rsquo;s a power that seems to pulsate from him, this peculiar condition was observed by this man in the presence of the Sage after awhile, that made him start to test now the values, to test the laws involving the changes occurring. He then asked the Saint how to meditate and what meditation would involve more for him, the Saint said &ldquo;You have to close your eyes because that is the reference point in the human mechanism whereby you can adjust your consciousness and experience joy, bliss, and peace.&rdquo; So the man being a scientist and also interested in cosmic consciousness and also having some religious affiliation, he wanted to bridge the gap, he didn&rsquo;t just want to know the information, he wanted to see the common gap between religion as it was presented in the form of the church which he classified as churchianity, he wanted to see science linked into this principle and he wanted to see the testimony of the Sage&rsquo;s experience, he wanted to evaluate this thing for himself now. So he decided to question the Saint, &ldquo;Why do you want me to close my eyes to look in? I took a pill and that went in just the same and it brought out an experience.&rdquo; And the Sage says, &ldquo;Well what traditional authority says taking a pill produces such results? What traditional authority says that your result is standardized? I am saying to you by traditional authority by experience, if you apply this attitude the result is always the same, it doesn&rsquo;t vary, it is there, it&rsquo;s a constant established condition and you&rsquo;re not going to see two different things, what you see and I see, in our experience, this particular condition is the same for both of us, it doesn&rsquo;t vary.&rdquo; 1:00 Now the scientist was then interested to experiment but he says now &ldquo;my traditional authority does not come from me as an individual telling you because you don&rsquo;t have to accept my word, my traditional authority, my textbook,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;comes from the scriptures of the world, just as your textbook comes from the computed data of your experiments.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll quote your scriptures because you&rsquo;re a Christian born in a Christian society, a reference point.&rdquo; So he said &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and all these things will be added unto you. Now you put the drug within you, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The scientist said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then I say &ldquo;Look within you, that&rsquo;s my traditional authority, because to seek is to look in, look somewhere, look, seek, where? It gives me position, reference point, within, who, you or I, both of us, me, that means we both gotta look inside and this inside is being classified as Kingdom of God, that is to say reservoir of cosmic consciousness because we&rsquo;re all seeking to experience cosmic consciousness and you say that when you put the pill inside, cosmic consciousness flows out. I say no, when I look in by my process, cosmic consciousness did flow out, we have already tested it before by trying to transport a piece of candy from India to here. So do you see why I say you look in and I don&rsquo;t accept the fact that you put in by the mouth?&rdquo; So the scientist then went along with the Sage to close his eyes and look in. He says &ldquo;Now seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and it&rsquo;s righteousness.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;that means to you as a scientist, the right attitude. Now when you put the pill in did you have the right attitude, were you looking for an experience, were you looking for excitement, what were you looking for, what was the right attitude, what was the rightness in putting it inside? I am looking in for my right attitude is that I want to see this cosmic consciousness and the mechanics of my nature come forward and reveal to me my true identity. 1:03 Now if you are doing it by putting the object in the mouth and you&rsquo;re doing it from fear that you would be discovered by your friends or fear of being called chicken or fear of being some other thing, then there&rsquo;s no right attitude. I&rsquo;m not doing it from fear, I&rsquo;m not doing it to please anyone, I&rsquo;m doing it because this is a research into my basic nature and that research tends to validate that I am Soul. Now if your attitude is right, then let us see if it works. The scientist says he was experimenting trying to find out but he did not say he was seeking God or cosmic consciousness, he&rsquo;s trying to explore, trying to find effects. Now he looked in and the first thing he was told to see was a light emanating from the forehead. He gazed for quite awhile and there appeared a light in the forehead and the light was so bright that he couldn&rsquo;t understand it, opens his eyes and he still saw it outside of himself. Now he didn&rsquo;t put an agent to his mouth to acquire this light, it was just a matter of going in and closing and the light came, but he noticed at the same time while the light was coming, there was a sensation of peace and at the same time joy for the first time started to well-up from his heart and the sensation of bliss like an electrical flow was passing through his tissues and he felt like if he was becoming a young man again, his skin was pulling into a certain condition of youthfulness. 1:05 Now the Sage said to him after four hours of looking in himself, &ldquo;Open your eyes but don&rsquo;t move and see what you can adjust to this environment, see how long what you have experienced will remain with you.&rdquo; To his surprise that sensation, that light, remained for seven days getting stronger and stronger each day. Now the Sage said to him, &ldquo;Did the pill you use produce such a result, are you finding yourself smoking?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;You have a headache?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you feel intensely hungry or do you want to fight somebody?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you satisfied that you are a human being in this world?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you any animosity now to your fellow man from argument?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I accept them as they are.&rdquo; Then the Saint says &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve just begun this understanding of cosmic consciousness, from now on we will place the real workload on you, we gonna give you the real workload to go in to cosmic consciousness, you have bridged one gap, you have bridged the gap of depending on a physical agent to make certain internal changes, now you&rsquo;re going to apply volition.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Did you lose your willpower, did you find yourself helpless under the condition of meditation?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;No, I felt I could do anything I want, I felt no restriction.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Then we got something to measure by.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Ok you have no loss of volition, no loss of will, let us then go deeper into meditation.&rdquo; He spent a few months with the Saint meditating day in and day out, realizing his nature and in the subtle moments he would see and feel and know certain consciousness passing down that were not experienced when he took the drug for the first time. 1:08 There were levels of awareness that he did not knew existed and he had taken the drug many times hoping to achieve an awareness of the inner self but what he did remember or what he placed on record that every time he repeated the intake of the drug, it was the same total copy of his subconscious mind, nothing more was added. What he saw from the first time was always there and in fact certain incidents became more pronounced all the time and they shifted around according to the mood he was in at the time, but nothing new was ever added. So he realized he was shortchanged but this new awakening from this new technique of going into himself, he saw for the first time inner light, inner peace, and the various levels of being going on in himself and he realized now that here was the first time he was experiencing truth of his nature. The Saint then said, &ldquo;if you think that the process of meditation satisfies what you&rsquo;ve experimented upon and experienced, do you find any repercussions, do you find any drawbacks, do you see any after effects that are detrimental to you, do you see the fulfillment of the claims of the process?&rdquo; 1:10 And the scientist after evaluating and writing up his paper was his final statement to the Sage before he left, &ldquo;I wish I can start all over with what I know right now and really go to work on my being.&rdquo; And the Sage said to him, &ldquo;Why wish to start all over, why not go on improving where you are right now from what you have got?&rdquo; In other words the experience of the past is valid because you got a reference point whereby this new experience is going to outweigh the other, this is the first time you got something to measure. If you did not have that one, you can&rsquo;t measure it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you would be in the same position like your child and you, he would have the experience and you not having it, how can you communicate? Now you have both experiences which you can evaluate.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Now, but you&rsquo;re not compelled to tell the other person to do the same thing, it&rsquo;s up to the other person to discover and want this evaluation of himself.&rdquo; Tonight before we have some answers and questions concerning to what I&rsquo;ve said, we will apply the method that the Sages have left us to experience this consciousness in ourselves and this is meditation, we close the eyes, keep the spine straight. 1:12 Keep the mind at a point between the eyebrows or the reference point, this reference point from traditional authority of the Saints states, &ldquo;If thine eye be single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; That is to say if the two physical eyes are focused into a single position at the point between the eyebrows thus producing single vision-ness, light in the body will come out. The validity of this light is that the body is already matter in a congealed form and matter in a congealed form is already light according to the Einsteinian principles and according to traditional authority of the scriptures that God made Man out of light principle because &ldquo;in His own image&rdquo; that would mean the cosmic consciousness germinated the human mechanism out of atomic matter and &ldquo;its own likeness&rdquo; it would have to endow it with the capacity of total awareness, that would mean affecting the atomic mass, not imagining that there is an association with the atomic mass, it would have to definitely be identified with the atomic mass thereby proving that God is in Man. 1:14 As we close our eyes and watch in between the eyebrows and we listen with the right ear to the audible life stream, we will link up now in consciousness, the light that will come there is a sort of luminescence. It has three colors: gold, blue, and white. The outer ring is gold, the inner ring is blue, and the third inner ring is white in the shape of a star. You cannot imagine it, it exists there as such and is brought to focus on its qualifications, its own magnetic pull. Now as you gaze there, you&rsquo;ll find your mind having a tendency to drift, this is natural because this is a moving universe, it is not a stationary universe, it&rsquo;s not a static universe and the object is to be outside of that static pull hence the term &ldquo;ecstasy,&rdquo; ex-static. 1:16 Now as you watch and the mind, having this tendency to drift, it may drift to an idea or a thought pattern concerning some past experience of the subconscious mind. If it does sooner or later it will end up generating frustration and the vital life energy would be blocked again. Now if you find the mind drifting away to some idea or thought concerning the future, sooner or later it will generate anxiety and that will block the life flow. Now if the mind would center itself on the idea of Now, the present, the life flow begins to flow normally, naturally, and therapeutic. It starts the process of self-healing, self-alignment of the cells and a gradual electro-magnetizing of the spinal column and the awakening of the intuition. Hence the mind stays in the conscious idea of Now, the thought of Now, here, eternal Now, no end. (Meditation). 1:18 While your mind is centered on the Now, you&rsquo;ll notice that you&rsquo;re breathing extremely slow and there are brief moments or intervals between each breath as they become longer and longer separating from each other, there seems to be an internal suspension occurring. (Meditation). Now slowly open the eyes but not completely, partially, but don&rsquo;t move, try to be still aware of this body in a state of suspended peace, try to feel the bliss that is permeating the mechanism, try to be aware of the joy passing over the entire surface area of the body, feeling it welling up and flowing normally. Now again close those lids and dive deep in to the inner awareness of the consciousness, feeling your consciousness expanding out beyond the surface area of the skin like an electrical wave, your consciousness is hooked onto that electrical wave flowing past the skin into space and time into the very bedrock of the atomic structure where there is no boundary, total space-less-ness (Meditation). 1:24 Slowly open the eyes but not completely, still holding onto the peaceful effects and the inner joy that is flowing up from the reservoir of consciousness. Now slowly close it and dive deeper again into infinite awareness feeling the in-dwelling spirit passing as a vital electric charge through your entire body bringing about total surrender to the Divine Light (Meditation). &ldquo;Beloved Masters of the universe bless this meditation with Thy presence and permeate our consciousness with the Divine Truth transmute our cells from corruption to non-corruption and grant us the full realization of enlightenment&rdquo; (Meditation). 1:27 The perfume of love universal is flowing through this room now and the senses can absorb it (Meditation). The incense of wisdom is permeating the room now infusing the brain with intuitive awareness (Meditation). The Divine glow of warmth of the universal strength and fortitude is permeating the room now, flowing out and in and around our bodies (Meditation). We feel our oneness in everything (Meditation). Now slowly open the eyes, gradually adjusting back to the environment but don&rsquo;t move, feeling the electromagnetic energies permeating your cells infusing it with life, flowing from the reservoir of consciousness. Open the eyes completely but still don&rsquo;t move, adjusting to the physical world. Try to see how long this effect remains with you while you are conscious, employ volition to hold onto its effect. Thank you. 1:32 I guess you must have lots of questions you would like to shoot or you&rsquo;re too filled with your portable paradise now, you&rsquo;ve found the reservoir of peace and bliss, inner light, no one can take it from you, you have access to it any time of the day, night, any part of the universe you go, you have access to it. Audience: In meditation are there different stages that one could through like the passive stage and then the active in meditation? Adano: Yes, you see the body is full of tension and therefore if you employ a tranquilizer you relieve the tension, that&rsquo;s a passive effect. Now the meditation produces that effect naturally, but then that doesn&rsquo;t say you neglect your existence because the Sages don&rsquo;t want you to be irresponsible, they want you to generate volitional activity, it&rsquo;s the Will that directs all activity, it&rsquo;s not reason or logic, it&rsquo;s the Will, eventually &ldquo;I will get up.&rdquo; &ldquo;I reason to get up&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t prove it, you still have to exert Will upon a body, so activity in meditation in the active state is now it begins, the workload of activity begins now. 1:34 How long you apply the &ldquo;holding on&rdquo; effect of the volition on this electromagnetic charge of God&rsquo;s life power on this body form and deal with your fellow man in a right way is active meditation. You see how simple the thing becomes now? How living and dynamic the thing is now because there is no room for non-creative activity, it&rsquo;s all creative activity. Audience: Meditation is a continual process. Adano: Yes, it&rsquo;s from the restful state or God state of eternal inner rest of pure reservoir of peace to outward creative activity so Sages assume responsibility of living in the world to act in the world, they do not go away from the world. Audience: But that&rsquo;s the same as &ldquo;pray without ceasing.&rdquo; Adano: Right, it&rsquo;s exactly the process but you must be able to recognize the results that you are seeking because if you can recognize it now, you know you have tapped it. It hasn&rsquo;t gone anyplace, it&rsquo;s still there, every time your willpower ignites it or triggers it, it&rsquo;s there and if you are in doubt, you just close the eyes and accelerate it by half-opening, half-closing it occasionally, you have the accelerator like a car. You still have the ignition switch and the gas tank is full of peace. 1:36 Audience: How much effort (inaudible)&hellip; Adano: How much effort it takes to release this? Audience: Well suppose the person is very busy, suppose there is a great deal of tension, do they have to practice hard to get this to go? Adano: Well as I said earlier, if the scientist has to put extra (inaudible) everyday to get the same thing but cause the cells to deteriorate, this here is hair but you don&rsquo;t&hellip; just said to the lady if you want to trigger it again, you do like that and start it all over again. If you feel it&rsquo;s waning off, but it can&rsquo;t wane off completely because it&rsquo;s an electromagnetic charge. The battery it&rsquo;s like two pieces of metal here that can&rsquo;t act as a magnet. I take an electrical wire and pass it around and put it on a battery and it electromagnetizes it, now it will pick up another piece of object and any time I want to reactivate it, it&rsquo;s there. Audience: Are we supposed to be able to start this effect and then do what when it wears off? 1:38 Adano: Well do you feel it wearing off? Audience: Some of it. Adano: Alright then close the eyes again, slowly open it but not completely, do you feel the thing charging up back again? Audience: Perhaps. Adano: Well as you automatically do that a few times, in ten minutes if you can do this, open and close, like you ever see a Navy flashlight communicating across from one ship to another? If you can move this function of the lid of the eyes in ten minutes 15-20 times, you will automatically recharge the energy back, you are recharging the thing. If you do it four or five times in ten minutes, that much is recharged, how many times you compress this function&hellip; but you are applying volition, that means you are aware of what you are doing and handling it yourself, you are in charge of the flow. Audience: Do you have to shut your eyes completely or not quite? Adano: In the beginning stages to enhance it is to close the eyes completely but as it becomes natural habit, it will automatically go on because Man is a creature of habit, sooner or later this becomes a habitual automatic thing. For instance when I close my eyes and I go into it but I can keep my eyes and go into it now. But you couldn&rsquo;t see but you felt it pass through the room. 1:40 You see this is the phenomenal part of the thing or the truth of the thing, that while I&rsquo;m awake in the active state, I am orbiting exactly with this planet, I&rsquo;m orbiting with this life principle, I&rsquo;m hooking into this principle. Now when I slow down in the passive state and close my eyes, I&rsquo;m doing exactly the same but I want this awareness in the conscious waking state, I don&rsquo;t want to live a passive, irresponsible state because there is no productivity of consciousness there. That doesn&rsquo;t say we should not go into this state and sit back and relax but it is to be able to transfer this flow from passive to active but that doesn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re gonna out to hit each other on the head and try to convert the other person because this is entirely not the relationship, the relationship is how to behave in the active state with it, how to live with your fellow man for the first time in the active state of it and how to trigger it whenever there&rsquo;s a tendency for it to go into discharge. It&rsquo;s like a battery, how to trigger on the recharging effect of it and keep it at a peak frequency but the technique is simple. Do you see the simplicity of activating the eyelids? Audience: I can&rsquo;t make it work. Adano: No, well, is it wearing off now? Audience: Yeah. Adano: Then start again, as soon as you feel it&rsquo;s wearing off, start again until this thing builds up enough charge. Audience: It seemed like for a short time that I couldn&rsquo;t focus my eyes together but I seemed to feel a power slightly below the eyes. 1:42 Adano: Yes, this is natural, now this similarity can be felt in taking a highball or taking a chemical agent but they wear off to the extent that it leaves you nauseated, this has no nauseation in it because instead of being pulled back here alone, the sensation of peace is here all the time pulsating like an inner pulsation, right here it&rsquo;s pulsating now and you can feel it pulsating there as your consciousness dwell on it and every time you close and open, close and open, it widens the band like a variable condenser in a radio, you&rsquo;re changing the frequencies thereby causing expansion of awareness all the time. You cannot do this with the drug because you have no relation or control, all the controls have been taken out from under you and you have to run the gamut of the experience in the drug. Here you can turn on, switch off, go anyway you want to do, but still knowing it that it&rsquo;s there and flip it on all the time. This is what Jesus meant, &ldquo;If thine eye be single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; Audience: Were we supposed to continue trying keeping our eyes closed? Adano: Yes, this is the path of Masters because this is the techniques that release the cosmic consciousness in us you see, this is the release of cosmic consciousness that is dormant in there and this release is starting out with light and peace, bliss and awareness and as you &ldquo;trim the lamp,&rdquo; you know in the early Christian teachings, that&rsquo;s where we take our traditional authority now, by trimming the lamp, by holding vigil, the ten virgins who trimmed the lamp, in other words it means utilizing the ten avenues of your make-up to be aware and trim it, that is to sit in vigil and flip you know, turn up and down, you are in control all the time. There&rsquo;s no external agent now impeding or no external agent to rely on because you the Divine Consciousness is in control. Audience: Adano if you practice this 15 minutes a day would not this have a tendency gradually extend throughout the day the effects? Adano: Yes, this is true, if you start off 10-15 minutes in the morning and before lunchtime or so another 10-15 minutes, it spreads and the evening time after you finish work, 10-15 minutes before you drive your car home. 1:45 Again every time you feel the build-up of tension in the nervous system, that is an overloading of static electricity in the cells, anytime you feel this gloomy condition coming on, which is an overloading, flip it on and sort of agitate it back into normal rest, it causes everything to subside back into its present state and you have this flow, it permeates you all the time. Audience: Is it more effective before you take any food or does that make any difference? Adano: In the early stages yes, but don&rsquo;t get hung up on the idea or fanatical on the idea that it can&rsquo;t be done after you eat you see, then this would be an untrue science, science has nothing to do with that, it&rsquo;s practical and feasible and better to do it on an empty stomach like you know you tell your kids &ldquo;pray before your lunch&rdquo; or you eat. Human beings need to revitalize before consuming food because food is matter being broken down by the human mechanism into energy indirectly through the saliva process. Now this is energy directly infusing itself from the reservoir of energy that is permeating you in this whole environment and you are feeding off of it. This is your Divine Mother feeding you or God is feeding you directly now because you have an alliance with Him and the alliance is that when Jesus the man said, &ldquo;None come unto the Father but by Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Seek ye the Kingdom of God which is within you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If thine eye be single, the whole body is full of light,&rdquo; these are only indications from a traditional authority as to the source of this direct flow, do you follow now? 1:47 Audience: In other words then when we&rsquo;re meditating, we know that the blood is going to the head, but if you&rsquo;ve eaten it&rsquo;s trying to go two places at once. Adano: Right it is slowing it down, in other words you are channeling off you see. So it&rsquo;s wiser in the early stages to do it before eating that does not say I said before that you cannot do it after eating. Now the point is that I have found in my own experiences and in research, when you take a drug on a full stomach you have a certain result, you do meditation on a full stomach you have a certain result. You take a drug on an empty stomach, you have a different result, you take a meditation on an empty stomach you have a different result. I found the most feasible results is on a partially empty mechanism. I don&rsquo;t advise to load up the mechanism because it&rsquo;s an overload, it&rsquo;s like too much gas going to your carburator, you&rsquo;re overloading. It&rsquo;s the same thing in your mechanism, if you have food which is indirect energy and then pulling down direct energy, there&rsquo;s gonna be an overload you see. Now the important thing is the attitude all the time, not to strain in any of this sitting down and trying to lock in on or open it, because there is no strain. In the first place it is supposed to remove strain like the tranquilizer would do in the first place, it would remove the strains that is there or the tensions that is there, this is supposed to remove it and come through the mechanism, is that clear? 1:50 Audience: Adano, thank you very much for explaining something&hellip; I have been with teachers who were supposed to be in cosmic consciousness and during meditation we were meditating for something very spiritual and something made me open my eyes and look at him and here he was just blinking his eyes with his eyes rolled up and I was wondering what on Earth, the expression of his face. Adano: Yes you see the student studying does not know all the information right away but because students in colleges today are not waiting for all that information therefore they are working with certain agents to try to experience something that the Sages have been trying to point out by their own body mechanism. We have to update the truth in our mechanism, we have to communicate to suit the youth, we have to communicate to suit the adult that is caught in survival patterns you see. Now if you can&rsquo;t update this information to fit in and if you can&rsquo;t experience it when you update it and apply it then it has no relationship as far as you are concerned in this survival pattern but if it&rsquo;s updated to fit in and if you can see the linkage, the traditional linkage, the scientific linkage, and the actual application linkage with yourself in the material realm where you earn your daily bread and live with your family and the responsibilities that go with the family then you have bridged the greatest truth about life itself, that you know how to live in it now. You want to say something? Audience: Yes but I don&rsquo;t know how to ask it. Adano: &ldquo;Ask and it is given,&rdquo; it does not matter how you ask, you see &ldquo;how&rdquo; might interfere with what you really want to say. 1:52 Audience: Well there seems to be so many sources, so many different books and different paths and different teachers saying somewhat similar things but different things. We listened to your tape on the guru / student relationship and it&rsquo;s been bothering me how one gets in contact with the guru or knows where to go for authority. Adano: When you start, normally you want all the questions answered immediately before you practice, that is like learning to play the guitar, you want to play Bach Chaconne before you learn the scale and you can&rsquo;t be trained by Segovia because he&rsquo;s not interested in teaching you scales so he&rsquo;s gonna tell you &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wasting my time at the present moment, go and learn the fundamentals of music and I&rsquo;ll pick up with you when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo; Living Masters do exist but via the books, via the exposure to meditational circles and people on the path help you to gain an understanding that when you come in the range of the Living Master, He will take up where you left off. That&rsquo;s why they say, &ldquo;When the student is ready, He is there.&rdquo; Now that moment starts the Guru / disciple relationship, prior to that it&rsquo;s not Guru / disciple relationship, do you follow? Now each one will be drawn to a Living Master when he has made the effort to reach that level, I certainly couldn&rsquo;t go and ask Mr. Segovia to teach me to play the guitar when I don&rsquo;t know the fundamentals of the instrument, I&rsquo;d be wasting my money and his time in the first place. 1:54 That doesn&rsquo;t say you would not have some form of compassion or consideration or some information for me where to start off you see, but if I went and got acquainted and made effort and then I show some signs of promise in my effort before I know it someone is gonna be recommending Mr. Segovia to me or recommending that I be trained with Mr. Segovia and sooner or later the inner cross currents, I will meet Mr. Segovia, see what I mean? So it&rsquo;s the same thing, you are exposed now in an inner search of yourself and certain truths you need to know first about yourself right here to work with in this physical world and as you get these truths and apply them gradually, you would be equipped mentally to understand a Master&rsquo;s consciousness when He initiates you because that&rsquo;s what He&rsquo;s gonna do for you, He&rsquo;s gonna initiate you and you are ready for the initiation and then He will take over the inner training of your inner life though He will impose the disciplines at the same time and they may be very harsh because He doesn&rsquo;t make the disciplines easy, in fact He speeds up the discipline on you. Now if anyone has seen the master classes of Segovia on TV with students who went to play guitar, there was one boy who told Mr. Segovia, but &ldquo;my instrument don&rsquo;t play like that and it don&rsquo;t sound like that&rdquo; and he took the boy&rsquo;s instrument and played a note and he says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come back no more,&rdquo; you see what I mean? These are the kind of conditions that would exist. The Masters don&rsquo;t waste time, They are interested to bring the Soul back, but They are imposing the disciplines there whereby you are pulled in, but He hopes that you have already work out fundamentals you understand, and I&rsquo;m glad that there are 100 people who have done all kind of experimented with fundamentals that can appreciate a Guru / disciple relationship. 1:56 You see why I started the lectures with a Guru/disciple relationship to show that is where the final association ends between two beings and the next level last night was the disciple&rsquo;s role, how he comes to control his emotional nature, tonight I&rsquo;m showing where the mass media of the human world is caught up trying to find a way out. So we are, and that includes me at one time, in this mass media process you see, we had to try and experiment and drop out and do all kinds of crazy things till we wake up. In the meantime we are asleep, that is we are ignoring the truth of ourself so if you feel that the need for the Guru is there, it&rsquo;ll come because every desire for God is fulfilled because your desire to know that you are Soul cannot go unheard by any great Master but sometime the great Master may use little less individuals to give you encouragement till He knows you are ready for the full blast of His presence, you follow what I&rsquo;m trying to say? Audience: If we practice as you&rsquo;ve shown us tonight, the more we go within ourselves, the more we will know from all this mass of books and so forth and teachers&hellip; Adano: Yes, you will have a measuring stick, right, you will have a measuring stick. Now let me show you an illustration, we have traditional authority. There was a man called John baptizing and had many disciples around him, yet he kept preaching, &ldquo;There cometh One whose shoes I cannot begin to step into and He&rsquo;s not baptized by water, but by Spirit,&rdquo; that means in a word, a relationship now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing a physical patting you on the back boys and start to get you encouraged to get into this thing.&rdquo; 1:58 And when He did come and He was initiated by John and then came down the mountain, John turned to his own disciples and said, &ldquo;There goeth the Master.&rdquo; Now people say John must be stupid, he wanted to get rid of the best thing he had, disciples around him but not so. They were ready now to accept from the long mass of assimilation and analysis and we have such a person existing on the earth plane all the time, these are Masters are there. Many people have been fortunate and many are waiting but that doesn&rsquo;t say you are not going to be fortunate too. As long as you sift out you will come to that one important thing, you will have that relationship, you cannot be denied the relationship, it solves your problem? Audience: It doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem but it at least explains it (laughter). Adano: Well India is the land that has brought forth Masters but Masters who walk the Earth do not confine Themselves to India and They have worked on the earth of America and on American soil and They have gathered home into Their consciousness many Americans who live and work like you and I and have the daily turmoils and there are teeming millions in India who are not even gathered in by those very Masters where They were born, you follow what I&rsquo;m saying? 2:00 When the Soul nature of the individual regardless of the location on the Earth by his initial effort to seek God, the Manifested Master will be there for that moment but He has observed you long before you know He exists. In other words there is a Master and it&rsquo;s there, but your part now in the process is to prepare yourself. You know the Boy Scouts used to say &ldquo;be prepared&rdquo; and Jesus gave a parable, &ldquo;trim your lamps lest the bridegroom when he cometh like a thief in the night.&rdquo; A Master may walk through this room and He may be like the thief in the night as far as the inner consciousness is concerned in your make-up and you cannot recognize Him, but He has recognized you but if you were trimming the lamp, you would have an inner experience of His real nature and then when you see Him in the flesh, a greater inner experience also is all I&rsquo;m trying to say because there are certain things that will recognize the Master. It&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s not an imagination, there are genuine spiritual laws that satisfy the devotee. Of all the teeming books, the Masters only teach one truth all the time and I say &ldquo;the Masters,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean the teachers, there&rsquo;s a big difference between a Master and a teacher you know, a Manifested Master is one who has achieved all levels of awareness and returns with the full responsibility of lifting you up back there, therefore He goes before you when you are ready to go behind Him. 2:02 Now I know some people who have known of a Manifested Master living in India and they spent umpteeth dollars to get to India to sit in His ashram and they were there and parting from the Master He said, &ldquo;You can only take what you have brought but I&rsquo;m always with you so meditate whenever you are.&rdquo; If you brought a small limited degree of understanding of life, it&rsquo;s like this size of cup and you go to someone with a pitcher of water and if the cup is only one pint certainly it&rsquo;s not going to extend itself to two pints, you&rsquo;ll get one pint full but happy to know that this brain that the Creator has made is not a restricted one pint cup principle, it&rsquo;s an ever expanding principle you see. It&rsquo;s like a variable condenser therefore it will expand more and more to absorb the Guru, absorb the Cosmic Principle, so if you wanna go to India or you prefer to prepare yourself that Master can meet you right here in America, but India is the place where these Masters have their ashram. Now you know where the thing is? Segovia lives in Spain, he gives classical concerts every year in America and students flock yet he only selects a few to his personal attention. 2:04 That doesn&rsquo;t say he has no compassion for the rest, information and so forth, the great Masters live in the ashram of India, that doesn&rsquo;t say they don&rsquo;t come to America to lecture but when they come if you are ready from within yourself you will have the experience and as she said, &ldquo;of all them that is culled out, this one here is locked on&rdquo; but then you must appreciate the Guru / disciple relationship from then on, you&rsquo;d have to learn to appreciate what you&rsquo;ve got. Some people have been initiated by great Masters and don&rsquo;t appreciate the relationship, you see, and are still searching, though they&rsquo;re having an inner awareness they don&rsquo;t know for sure properly. So this again is why I said the greatest relationship that exists between Man is the Guru / disciple relationship. Now even Jesus had twelve disciples and at a critical moment it wasn&rsquo;t the Guru who let them down, it is they who let the Guru down, He told them their defects in themselves and they acted out their defects. One would deny Him when the cock crowed twice and all these going to run away so the Guru knows that and when He was collected them, He already knew where they were. If you read your scriptures you will see this awareness is all-reaching, it&rsquo;s Cosmic Consciousness, it knows in this room when that Master consciousness will pull, how many will pull in, it&rsquo;s there because that inner light is shining all the time. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a sacred relationship between the disciple and the Guru. 2:06 Audience: Is there any significance behind any of the other colors besides red, gold, and green? Adano: If you see the red, which I did not mention, then you&rsquo;re not at this moment interested in It&rsquo;s presence, we&rsquo;re only interested in gold, blue, and white. Audience: I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t know why I said the gold, red, and green. Adano: Now if we see the gold, blue, and white, we have to train ourselves to adjust to it until that light itself does what it is supposed to do for you then you will not ask me because in there the experience itself will open up for you, you will see what each one of these three colors will do. It&rsquo;s that where God is, it&rsquo;s in that level God is the teacher, God is the real Guru, not the human man, the human man is not the Guru, the human man is a filter for the Eternal Light acting as an example to another form who have need of light, you see? I have need of light so I look to a Master in form but behind the Master I have the reality that is the Eternal Light that is passing to me, that holds me up as a form. 2:08 So I want to know, He tells me there are three distinct colors that I must be aware of, I don&rsquo;t want to sidetrack myself so I must make the effort to see these three distinct colors and I must work with them, that is the discipline implied. So don&rsquo;t feel frustrated or disappointed if you&rsquo;re not getting results right away because sooner or later it has to come of its own nature, this is fundamental. Let&rsquo;s put it like the insurance people, by the law of averages you are bound to end up having one experience of it, mathematics alone will let you experience it you see? The goal is the Cosmic Vibration or Holy Spirit and the gifts thereof are many, some people speak in tongues, healing and so forth, but that&rsquo;s only one aspect. The blue is the Christ Intelligence or the intuitive nature present in the whole of creation and the white is Cosmic Consciousness present in and out of creation.

<h2 id="1968-november---volume-5-guru-disciple-relationship">1968 November - Volume 5 Guru Disciple Relationship</h2>
<p>Adano68_11Vol5_GuruDiscipleRelationshipQ1RRNW6 - Audience: (Inaudible) although his latest love and possibly chief love is that of the Self Realization Fellowship in California known as SRF, the title of his talk is The Guru Disciple Relationship. We are sorry we missed perhaps the first five or ten minutes of the talk because a telephone call interrupted but really there was no beginning of the talk, he had been discussing personal matters with the group in the house and just gradually turned into his regular subject. Adano: &hellip;while Jesus was with them or the Guru was with them, yet there was one man in that particular drama that was given Cosmic Consciousness and you would think that a Guru would give it to His disciples and I said before &ldquo;when the student is ready&rdquo; and I described what are the readiness, the states of readiness, Master will appear. The one man that got it endowed on him was the thief on the cross. There were two of them and one started to criticize and jest at the dying Jesus and the other one said, &ldquo;You have no right to criticize this man, we have a right here to die here for our misdeeds but this man has none die for&rdquo; and this criminal turns to the man Jesus and said in these specific words, &ldquo;Master when Thy comest into Thy kingdom,&rdquo; two words he said before that, forget me or remember me which is it? Audience: Remember me. 0:02 Adano: Why did he say &ldquo;remember&rdquo; and why did he use the word Master to an individual who he had totally no awareness of just for the few moments he was going to be strung up next to him? Audience: We just know he did that&rsquo;s all. Adano: Now you really see what disciple/Guru relationship is, you are seeing a vivid example of true Guru/disciple relationship. The student was ready and the Master was there, he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Him&rdquo; Master or &ldquo;The&rdquo; Master, a Master was there. Now it takes Soul to recognize Soul but Soul recognition in most of us only can come under the readiness of pain, aggravation, frustration, and a broken life, it does not really come to us from a standpoint of love and this is what we have to learn yet. Audience: It could, couldn&rsquo;t it? Adano: Yes, but it most often comes by the other route, we are not asked to suffer and have a broken body by the great Sages to discover the God in ourselves, we are asked to love, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind and all your heart and your Soul&rdquo; and at the same time &ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; but how can you love your neighbor as yourself unless you know that you are Soul and that you don&rsquo;t live under the illusion that you have a Soul or he has a Soul, you see? You gotta know for sure he IS Soul that you can really love yourself as Soul too and you can only love him unless you love yourself first, you see? 0:04 So a Guru / disciple relationship is very important, in fact it is the only important relationship in the human form between two beings because He will take the place of all the different degrees of desire that the human mind can generate. Now I said that this criminal asked to be remembered and the reply was very specific, &ldquo;This day,&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say this 24th day of the month of July, year 4 AD or something (gap in recording)&hellip; 0:05 We were discussing one of the most important things a person would be interested in and that&rsquo;s the truth about himself. Now most of us when we talk about the truth about ourselves we are actually saying unknowing to ourselves that we would like to have life that would not cease, that would not have pain, that would not have fear or frustration, that would not have any kind of conflict, a type of life that would go on eternally fulfilling our whims and our desires, this is unknowingly what we&rsquo;re saying to ourselves what we want of life because as a living organism it is not possible for that inner self to really want or seek extinction. The tremendous yearning for experience, exposure, involvement, commitment, triumph keeps bubbling up in us you see, it is the active life. That&rsquo;s what is bubbling in us because we are life itself, life is a bubbling, active force, it&rsquo;s a vital force, constant in demand and any sign or any danger signal that would show any tendency of weakening, breaking down, or deteriorating is a challenge, unknowingly at times and knowingly, to this life principle in the human form. 0:08 This is an eternal truth that Man wants the eternal life hence any attempt on Man&rsquo;s part through his five senses is an attempt to extend the range of experience and prolong the period for the experience so it&rsquo;s inborn, it&rsquo;s innate in Man to crave eternal life. The Sages have taught that there is eternal life and that this eternal life is not what we think it is in layman&rsquo;s terms or from our vantage point of comprehension of eternal life, this eternal life that the Sages speak about involves a different aspect than the human body at a level at which the human body is vibrating at. The Sages are always speaking of Divine Life which is eternal, that is the universal principle, the principle of the I, the principle of the I AM, this I AM principle or ID is eternal, it&rsquo;s eternal within the human mechanism. 0:10 The mechanism is matter yet the mechanism as matter acting as matter essentially is spirit or pure energy with a bond of knowledge locked into it, a sense of awareness or consciousness locked into it. This sense of consciousness or awareness is the I AM, it&rsquo;s the one true reality of Itself and this is eternal, this doesn&rsquo;t have no extinction. There is no extinction for the I AM or the I AM-ness of consciousness, it is this I AM-ness that generates the conflict in the human mechanism and the consciousness or pure consciousness because the I AM-ness exists as consciousness already and is apart from structural matter or energy and the conflict between matter and consciousness is carried on by this fluctuation of I AM-ness. In the structure of matter the I AM-ness is your ego, in the pure consciousness of being the I AM-ness is Soul, see? 0:12 Now Man does not know he is Soul in pure consciousness. He always thinks he has a Soul from the structural point of his mechanism so his structural mechanism will say &ldquo;I am&rdquo; and when it says &ldquo;I am&rdquo; it is saying that it is separated from a higher principle and this higher principle is attached to it like a tail attached to an animal. But if the ego in the structural form is subdued and placed to rest or relaxed, then the I AM-ness the higher consciousness which is Soul, begins to pass through. This is the first experience of illumination. This is the awakening of Samadhi to see beyond the five senses, but we&rsquo;ll have our five senses to work with. It is one of the most frustrating and yet most elevating tools that the Creative Intelligence has devised in order to maintain a linkage between the pure consciousness and the stepped down consciousness in the form of matter. You see? What a wonderful alliance, what a wonderful framework of action occurring between structural matter and pure consciousness - that this one pure I AM consciousness, this one I AM experience maintains itself and it&rsquo;s this I AM that is constantly driving, probing, pushing for the outward realization. 0:14 Now, Jesus as a Master and from His vantage point when He spoke He made it clear by stating the first prerogative or the first attempt that the structure should make was to investigate, inquire within itself as to the fountainhead of its existence. So in His words you would say, &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and its righteousness and all these things will be added unto you.&rdquo; This is a declaration to the human form of the Divine Consciousness reduced to structural matter to recognize the I AM principle, but where would this structural form seek the I AM principle? Because the structural form would have to say &ldquo;I am, therefore I exist,&rdquo; you see? And the moment it says &ldquo;I am, therefore I exist,&rdquo; then I am existence and if I am existence then I am consciousness, you see? 0:16 This is the point that makes us aware that all Masters are only stating the one true law of life in this structure called matter and consciousness, that the I AM is the central focal point of existence, but what exists in the I AM that makes it of value that a man seeks that center of his being to function from? That center of the I AM has been called the Self. Now, what is the Self? It’s a word that has been fostered upon the consciousness to describe, to envelope, and to maintain certain functions of a mechanism but when we pin down these functions, we see that these functions are all reduced to three, we don’t seem to have any numerical value outside of three. That is the Self thinks, that’s one. The Self knows, that’s two, and the Self feels and react and that’s three. Hence our real trinity in the truest sense of the word trinity and in the truest capacity of Self, not the minor self, but the true Cosmic Self, God, as we can call it, is the thinking power of consciousness, the knowing power of consciousness, the feeling/reacting power of consciousness in Man as a replica of this Divine Law of the I AM, the pure I AM, but thinking, knowing, feeling, and reacting, the feeling/reacting is one, you see? These three principles are in a state of rest. They are not active within the I AM. 0:18 Within the I AM Self it is a state of rest, pure rest, this is validated by the Book of Genesis. God created the universe, emanated Itself into the universe in six days and I don&rsquo;t mean 24 hours, the six basic principles of time relationship and on the seventh day, which makes a scale because it&rsquo;s a musical principle, the whole thing is a scale, a musical scale, and on the seventh it was at rest. We have the dominant Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do, Do comes back to Do, but Do is the note that starts and finishes and comes to rest so the I AM consciousness and pure Self is total self rest and for matter to look back into itself and see its nature, it must look back to the state of pure rest and in that state of pure rest there is no reasoning, there is a complete abstraction, a complete lift-up from the relative mind into a pure abstract mind of pure tranquility but tranquility can be very detrimental to our restless mind, it can be detrimental to an active mind, it can be detrimental to a mind involved with its environment, tranquility can kill it yet tranquility can heal it and feed it and nourish it, you follow? 0:20 It is hard for someone to accept tranquility, peace as we know it as an infinity flow without end is not something that the five senses want. If peace was something that the five senses wanted, it would not get involved and commit itself you follow? It would not crave, it would not seek the eternal principle of life by commitment, it would seek the eternal principle of life by rest because when you put things to rest, you put them into their eternal state but if you put things into activity, you have already set the motions of frustration or repercussion so there is no peace but we don&rsquo;t know that, we only begin to recognize that after we find ourselves involved and committed then we realize that this is not the right approach to an inquiry of ourselves, the inquiry into ourselves being God realization is an inquiry into pure, undiluted, selfless rest and tranquility. 0:22 The question comes up, if that is really what abides in Man, a peaceful, restful, tranquil, serene fountainhead of life flow which is the God principle, where is the real value of its use in the external world to which we are committed to in a physical form? Because in the external world to which we are committed in a physical form, peace and tranquility has a competitor and that competitor is Man himself who seeks to compete with his fellow man you see and to compete with your fellow man in existence is super-activity and therefore peace has a very formidable foe in the environment in the form of super-activity to compete and stay abreast or ahead of fellow man, you see a tremendous interplay of these forces in ourselves? If we are too restful, too peaceful, that&rsquo;s no good. If we&rsquo;re too overactive, too over competitive, that&rsquo;s (inaudible), that doesn&rsquo;t say we should not strive to improve. 0:24 Where in this particular conflict can Divine Will play a part, where in it, that is the mechanism is supposed to accept the outcome of Divine Will with the external super-activity and the internal need for rest, there we see a tremendous sacrifice being brought to bear upon our mechanism. So this particular sacrifice we have many excuses, many names and labels to avoid a particular issue at times an excuse like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s karma,&rdquo; we use this excuse to avoid an issue, that was the man&rsquo;s karma and that was Divine Will you see but are we really facing the truth, are we really facing up to the thing and saying &ldquo;do we have some responsibility of bringing into focus the Divine Consciousness in our lives and that the Divine Consciousness work for us.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t say we are not gonna adjust our attitude to the outcome of the condition that are happening or when they occur, that doesn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re not going to make effort to direct our consciousness to bring about the result of something of value, we have to look at both outcomes and see a time principle. 0:26 If we&rsquo;re too soon, we may be out of time, we may hurt ourselves, if we are too late, we are out of time but if every desire pattern be it over-competition or be it a need for rest are being fulfilled at certain time periods with the intricacies all seem to fall into place, then we know we are having this miraculous Divine Life law working you see, now you say &ldquo;Divine Mother everything is working.&rdquo; In a way things fall into their position without too much effort and you begin to realize that you are working with a natural law. This understanding of what the natural law involves is what great Master Jesus meant by &ldquo;the righteousness,&rdquo; &ldquo;Seek ye first the Kingdom of God which is within you and its righteousness and all these things will be added unto you.&rdquo; You begin to see that the recognition of the I AM self as the pure thinking, knowing, feeling, reacting principle self is Divine Peace, an attitude of peace. This is the kingdom, this is the total fountainhead of existence and its right action, that is an interplay between the super-activity and the restful activity and the things being added is the timing process involving Divine Will, you being to see that this particular function works all the time. 0:28 Now where does the responsibility lie in us to initiate action? Only as we think. Now scriptures again say &ldquo;as a man thinketh in his heart, that is what he is.&rdquo; The thinking capacity is a principle that makes up the self, one of the triune functions of self, the real self in Man, thinking, the power to think, to initiate, to direct. We say we pray but in reality we think ideas that make up a prayer or words and eject them into consciousness causing them to germinate through their own vibratory nature and with the second principle of ourself that is the knowing, the acceptance, that second principle that makes up the cosmic self, we eject out this idea and we know, that is we accept these ideas manifesting. We&rsquo;ve come to the realization of our creativity to think, to know that is to eject, to accept, and when it occurs we see the third aspect, our feeling-reaction because our feeling-reaction can be either pleasant or unpleasant, you see? Now these three principles make up the self, this is the real self, this is the real kingdom in Man and it&rsquo;s at total rest, it&rsquo;s exposed to various desires and its patterns via the senses and we generate an involvement for those desires and patterns. 0:30 That doesn&rsquo;t say those desires are unimportant, it does not say those desires are unnecessary, that they are evil, it doesn&rsquo;t say they are good, it does not say they are important or least important, it merely states that via these senses we are exposed to the involvement with desire through which the self involving thinking, knowing, feeling, reacting comes into focus and is exposed and is tested. It&rsquo;s exposed to be tested from within that framework of desire. Now we need a certain disciple, a certain code to maintain a liaison between the self and desire and that is what Jesus gave in the form of the Beatitudes, they were merely attitudes of being, attitudes of behavior, an attitude whereby self would maintain a liaison with desire patterns focused on flowing through the five senses, you see? For the first time Man had a working code, he had a system of inner communication and extension with his environment and through this communication he was now able to implement a living experience of what is called this eternal life. 0:32 Now life is eternal, there is no death in life because every form of matter or structure of nature indicates life all the time. It&rsquo;s constantly changing from one form into another so there is no end, there is no death, but the eternal change life. So we see since the eternal life principle is there and it&rsquo;s inexhaustible, we recognize our relationship with it through the I AM-ness of it and that I AM-ness being the self communicates to its various levels of existence by thinking, by knowing, by feeling-reacting. Now feeling-reacting is the desire principle because without it there can be no thinking, there can be no knowing. God had to desire to create so that was a feeling-acting principle but He had to think up what He had to create and He had to know what He created He had to satisfy and maintain, you see? So our cells as a whole is the result of these basic principles that constitute self, that constitute our I AM-ness, that constitute the real I AM in us and it&rsquo;s this I AM that is making us, moving us, and actually resolving us and dissolving and absolving us by Its own natural momentum of rest. 0:34 It goes out from rest into super activity and it returns back into rest by super activity. It takes super activity to withdraw from activity into rest, we have to do some form of activity, we have to perform some activity to withdraw from the realm of activity and the involvement in order to acquire the rest, inquire, or acquire this natural inner peace, this perspective of our beingness or it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. Now the discipline of this super activity is called a Beatitude which is a code, a system of communicating, a system of behavior relationship but it&rsquo;s necessary to bring about this understanding of inner peace. Now through this inner peace we can now feel its presence in our daily activity that&rsquo;s why we say if you meditate before you act and there used to be an old saying that goes &ldquo;Think before you act&rdquo; but regardless if we think before we act or meditate before we act, the motivation and the accumulated result of this motivation is still a state of rest. 0:36 You must come to a point of rest, a point of quiescence feeling, naturalness, a sort of inner subsiding that this whole being is now like it&rsquo;s in harmony, it&rsquo;s like an instrument tuned up, all the forces are aligned but this doesn&rsquo;t come overnight, this is not an overnight process, this is like a plant growing, this may take many years and this is what the mind has to realize but during the process of growing there are definite certain psycho-physical changes, there are definite changes that occur within the body and mind, there are changes we may not be willing to accept and there are changes that we may not begin to recognize that have occurred in us, there are changes that occur within us that we are unable to work with, there are changes that occur in us that we can handle but have no way to apply it, you see? So many things have occurred, you have the power but no outlet to apply this power and you don&rsquo;t have the power and there is a need for power to be applied and yet the changes are occurring. 0:38 So it is so vast and so subtle that you don&rsquo;t allow the changes to disturb you, you continue to maintain the calmness within, within the I AM self maintain this calmness, live in this calmness, center this devotion in this calmness and from it try to recognize it&rsquo;s already manifesting the activities in your life, that whatever is happening it&rsquo;s happening in a normal, natural way but it&rsquo;s happening in a very subtle miraculous way that it is always taking you to something better all the time. See it is easy for a Master to raise the dead, to heal the sick, or feed a few thousand people or hold back the wind but how often would a Master go out doing that when there are teeming millions who have basic psycho-physical problems with the values of society and conventional demands of the civilization and the culture to work out, you see? The mere existing in a culture, in a particular civilization, in a particular climatic region demands certain attitudes of existence and if existence is what life eternal is based on and the realization of it is how to work with it in order to achieve enlightenment in it and to achieve the liberation that comes in it, then the great mastery of life and the only noble mastery of life is to find a relationship between this Soul and a Master Soul, that&rsquo;s why we say a need for a Guru / disciple relationship, that&rsquo;s why a great Master like Jesus came to demonstrate this relationship. 0:40 It would not be needed unless Man was not caught up in environmental circumstances and behavioral patterns. There were men who were caught up for the need of being fed because they were hungry, we&rsquo;ve still got a poverty program, we need billions of dollars to keep it going. We still have the lepers and the sick and the dying but you don&rsquo;t heal all of them, you don&rsquo;t cure all of them and bring them back all to life because it&rsquo;s not practical but the illustration that there is a Divine Law working in their lives that they can make an adjustment now to live in the environment that caused them to have a broken life, they can make the adjustment to the desire patterns that they created within themselves or release within themselves that broke up their lives from that very environment, this is what the mastery is. The mastery is how to work in the environment in the simple way, accepting the normal, natural patterns of life and working with them and moving on to a higher state of awareness and abundance and peace. This is what the great Sages are pointing out, that the modern man in his search for reality about himself must utilize the fundamentals of self, the fundamentals of beingness which make up the I AM in him and a reliance on the I AM. 0:42 Why a reliance on the I AM? When Moses got illumination on the Mount Sinai, he asked this consciousness &ldquo;What shall I call You, what name shall I tell these people?&rdquo; Seeing they had to have a name, why? Because the people at that time, the culture at that time had names for their gods or their god concept, they had to have a brand, a label for it. So he too afflicted by the environmental thinking also made the same demand on Cosmic Consciousness for such a name and out of that same Cosmic Consciousness, that same principle of Self, came back the one true statement, &ldquo;I AM that I AM.&rdquo; That is to say in pure consciousness the I AM exists, in reduced conscious structure of matter which is the consciousness reduced to structural matter now, the I AM exists, &ldquo;I AM that I AM.&rdquo; Now you, Moses, looking back into yourself from a structural matter vantage point and recognizing the God-self which is pure consciousness as the I AM within yourself as the directing force of thinking, knowing, feeling, reacting can only realize this though a physical body therefore there is no name for that I AM principle but the I AM-ness of it and I AM that I AM and of that he came back and proclaimed God, knowing fully within himself it was the I AM principle. 0:44 But realizing the level of their behavior, realizing the level of their involvement and their cultural attitude, he saw it would be highly impractical, nearby impossible to re-model these people into a state of consciousness that they can cope with. It would take them years of exposure to many enlightened Souls or Masters for them to rid the mind consciousness or the mind association that they were bodies possessing souls, it would take them a long time for them to rid themselves of this particular concept. And through the years as Moses went on, the prophets all came, the prophets all spoke to Man, slowly bringing Man to that point where he&rsquo;s getting to realize that he is Soul and in the life of a realized Master you see Soul for the first time demonstrating itself. Even in this present day there are teeming millions who still live, act, and die with the total acceptance that they have soul and that that soul is going to go into some area in space, I don&rsquo;t know how they are going to take it there, maybe with a spacecraft and maybe you&rsquo;re going to stoke it or use it for coals in the devil&rsquo;s furnace you know or they may stick it out on cloud nine with some white nightgown and play some harps, that&rsquo;s the concept people have of themselves. 0:46 But the few who have come to the realization that they are Soul and that Soul and its qualities, its principles, its laws can be recognized because it&rsquo;s an exact portrait or duplicate of the law of nature, there is no duality in it. What is true of the reality of nature is true of the reality of the Soul, identical in nature, the same law of the I AM, the same principle of thinking, knowing, feeling, reacting, existing. Now to think, very few of us knows how to do that, very few of us can hold a thought for a few minutes without deviating to another one so rest assured that thinking alone as a creative principle of the I AM self, of the Soul nature, is a requisite and required training and we need techniques to do it. One of the first techniques handed down and prescribed with tremendous value is Hong-Sau because it shows you the direct relationship with the structural matter and consciousness, that is consciousness is linked to breath which is a structural function of your body and once you see this connective link and this association of self identified into it then for the first time the power of thinking becomes stronger and centered and focused and can maintain itself from one thought to another. 0:48 A simple illustration, if you were to walk lifting one foot at a time sheerly by the power of the mind you could you not walk a mile in a day because mind to lift the body with its dumb flesh requires Will and if I was to lift my foot up/down I have to think in relationship and apply Will and if I do that I&rsquo;m automatically applying consciousness. Now because we are a synchronized being of thinking, knowing, feeling, reacting, walking becomes secondary nature to us after a certain period of adjustment from a child but if you were relate yourself back to the very fundamental of where consciousness began in matter and see the connection, you would realize that it would take you quite a long time to move this dumb flesh, this structural matter over a certain distance and time by the sheer consciousness. That&rsquo;s to show that we disregard from our I AM basic nature, we disregard the true potential of self, the true potential of the Divine Will and the Divine Life Power in us, we don&rsquo;t use it, we hardly use it, we take things for granted strictly by sounds through the senses, strictly by symbols and as Mr. Romney would say, &ldquo;universal brainwashing.&rdquo; 0:50 You see this is a normal truth, you see we are already hypnotized to the universe in which we live in and we parrot it, we are not free, how much freedom has a person really got? If he was to pin it down in words and put it on paper he discovers he has nothing, that&rsquo;s a remarkable discovery and very shocking to the ego you know but it&rsquo;s only because we have certain safeguards built into convention and society in the form of security, protection in the name of the law and Man is calling himself a civilized animal, this gives his fellow man the sense of security to walk on the street. These are all games we play with ourselves you know, these are the games we play, we are constantly playing games of rules and dont&rsquo;s and penalties, this is existence for Man, an existence in which he seeks eternal life from. He&rsquo;s seeking to extract eternal life from environmental obstacles, environmental freeways that he organized into existence yet the Soul is starving for want for adjustment for attitude for want of peace. Peace is natural, you don&rsquo;t have to sit down to cultivate it, it is a natural fragrance that flows out of our being, it&rsquo;s there all the time, it&rsquo;s a natural thing we have to release from ourselves. Most of us say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeking peace,&rdquo; but you really don&rsquo;t seek peace, you release peace from within yourself because this whole mechanism in a normal flow is at peace with itself otherwise everything would be disruption. 0:52 What you call a healthy body is a peaceful body, what you call an unhealthy body is a disturbed body, it&rsquo;s very overactive in some form. So when this body is at peace with itself, you are at peace with yourself so sitting down in a corner and closing one&rsquo;s eyes and hoping that this gonna make you perennially peaceful, you soon gotta get up and go someplace sometime and you gotta be someplace sometime. So it is not true that peace is something we are getting from outside by sitting down and hoping to accumulate it, peace is already dormant within the structural form, endowed by the I AM-ness of the form. The I AM-ness is eternally at rest and in the six days did It labor and the seventh day It rested so if it rested there was no more activity on the seventh day. In the seven centers of our being there is no more activity but total rest, in the seventh chakra, the total state of rest is there, see what I&rsquo;m trying to show? That you realize that you have a reservoir of peace on top of this human frame called a head but we don&rsquo;t know how to release this reservoir for it to flow down into the lower limbs. Now at times under emotional stress and deep devotion people raise their hands over their heads and shout out &ldquo;Dear God help me&rdquo; and during these outbursts a downward flow is released like an electrical wave baiting them and they feel completely relieved, completely healed in certain ways and they feel this tremendous peace that seems to blanket them because the reservoir is open now. 0:54 The activities that occur in the lower nature are like your six days of the creation and the seventh day of rest is the reservoir of peace that is there, it has to descend again sooner or later. Now the purpose of Kriya or any technique for that matter is to quicken one&rsquo;s evolution and why do we want to quicken our evolution in the first place, is it an important factor of existence? You know we are very prone to jump to the fact that because we use this term &ldquo;I have to quicken my evolution to find God&rdquo; or &ldquo;quicken my evolution, I gotta know everything and therefore I know more than you.&rdquo; You know this is a normal concept, &ldquo;If I have Cosmic Consciousness, I don&rsquo;t gotta do nothing, and I can be like the Saints, walk on cloud nine, pick apples from the sky&rdquo; you know or some kind of crazy act but Saints don&rsquo;t live that way, in fact they are the most normal people. The things that happen around a Saint is because people are ready for it to happen, a Saint on His own don&rsquo;t initiate anything or do anything because He&rsquo;s Soul, He&rsquo;s got nothing to do, He&rsquo;s a total self, He&rsquo;s a total I AM at work. So the quickening of one&rsquo;s evolution is an incentive for the being or the person who still thinks he has a Soul, that terminology is essential for him until he breaks away from that concept that he has a Soul then he knows that quickening of the evolution is not necessarily something to hang onto, he doesn&rsquo;t have to latch onto that concept, he&rsquo;s got a different approach to his existence, he IS Soul therefore he doesn&rsquo;t evolve, he&rsquo;s releasing something that is dormant that has always been there in a dormant state and for the first time having an opportunity to flow from a correct attitude. 0:56 Hence when say the Beatitudes are the right way to behave, for the first time this thing can flow, one of the Beatitudes, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,&rdquo; this is a normal naturalness, for one to be normal and natural without any animosity to anything. The mere naturalness from the heart to be sincere and relieved, this peace and this alone is power because it does not restrict or interfere with the endocrine glands and life energy and the electrical nature of the Man, a natural clean life without any mental inhibition, mental restriction, mental frustration, grief, or self incrimination or some guilt complex. Free from these things this whole life flows, it has nothing else to do but flow because it was created to flow in a natural way therefore it&rsquo;s eternal, it&rsquo;s true nature is eternal, it&rsquo;s the eternal-ness of its nature. We seek this eternal nature but until we recognize where this eternal nature exists in, it would not flow out. We are confined to the senses to work with it in an environment but it&rsquo;s within the very being of the I AM-ness, it&rsquo;s in the being of the Self that the principle of thinking, the principle of knowing, and the principle of feeling / reacting would allow this naturalness to flow out of a mechanism called matter. 0:58 That&rsquo;s why the Hindu Sages would say or in the scriptures would say, &ldquo;A man who speaks the truth can move a mountain&rdquo; but what is a man who speaks the truth? That is a man who has no animosity, he has no resentments, he has no need to make statements that he cannot fulfill, you know what I mean? A man of truth is a man who just accepts life totally, irrevocably at rest and everything being provided for in its true nature and his attitude is one of submission to its laws and that is Divine Will in his life, his whole attitude is Divine Will whatever the Divine Will wants of him, he&rsquo;s moving. Now in some men&rsquo;s mind such an individual is an impractical individual, such an individual is a misfit in society because you have to wait a long time for him to act when an emergency is at stake, you see what is an emergency for one man is not an emergency for him, you see? Now as far as human concern and as far as a human involvement, what is to one man a detriment to him is not a detriment, what is a mistake for one man to him is not a mistake, it&rsquo;s a success. So that type of individual is gonna be a conflict, he&rsquo;s gonna be something that is gonna alienate people and at times he is alienating the run of the mill people. So the individual of truth has to adjust to certain way of existence within himself and provide the external laws and will work with them to maintain equilibrium, this is a challenge with the Saint. 1:00 The Saint of today or the realized man of today or the man of truth or realization is a man who can make the adjustments to the environment without destroying his spiritual nature, see what I mean? If he can work in the environment with the attitude that is of good and the attitude that is of right thinking and living, he doesn&rsquo;t have to short-change his principles of existence. This is the core, the very bedrock of eternal living because this eternal living is universal. Jesus as a Master knowing this universal truth made a declaration to that effect, &ldquo;I&rdquo; not me the Jesus, &ldquo;I&rdquo; the I AM-ness in all things, &ldquo;have come&rdquo; that is the I AM-ness in all of us is ever here and present now &ldquo;that ye may have&rdquo; that the structural matter form can have &ldquo;life more abundantly&rdquo; you see? &ldquo;I have come that ye may have life more abundantly.&rdquo; 1:02 Now He didn&rsquo;t say life more ridiculous, life more out of proportion, life on the short end of things but life more abundantly, that is to say the I AM-ness which is ever present now within all of us releases within the structural form the abundant life flow of eternal peace and joy and through evaluation of the very things that the life form is composed of, the very things that this eternal life is holding up as a form and making possible as a form to exist in, you see what I mean? It is this &ldquo;I,&rdquo; this real &ldquo;I&rdquo; principle that is flowing in all of us that is using this mechanism to recognize it. In other words the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; eternal, is using the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; imminent, in the body to recognize the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; external, you see? This is &ldquo;I,&rdquo; if everything in this room was to say &ldquo;I&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re all nouns right? In a language they are all nouns because they are things, a thing is a noun, a thing is not a verb so if each one of these things was personalized to say &ldquo;I,&rdquo; they automatically will indicate the &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo; of existence. Now &ldquo;I, I, I&rdquo; all &ldquo;I&quot;s equal to the same &ldquo;I,&rdquo; they are equal to one another, mathematics, the very basic law of Divine Union, all things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another, right? So this universal equalness or this universal recognition of one-ness or affinity is the Divine Consciousness, this is the Divine Self. 1:04 Now to affect it, that&rsquo;s to say causing it in some way to be in your possession, basically is what we live for in a physical form, we are working primarily to acquire ourselves in these forms, isn&rsquo;t that right, isn&rsquo;t that exactly what we are doing? These &ldquo;I&quot;s are already equal to themselves therefore they are me and am I not in a divine way seeking to acquire myself. So this is the life abundant projecting out from the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; projecting from the self, you&rsquo;re realizing that everything here is personalized, it is you, the essential self personalized because it is the essential you that was in an another human form that put it together. His &ldquo;I&rdquo; is your &ldquo;I,&rdquo; &ldquo;love your neighbor as thyself,&rdquo; love the Lord thy God as yourself, how else? What is self? The so called love for self and every form of self comes back to the personalized &ldquo;I,&rdquo; comes back to the conscious one, comes back to the universal thinking, the universal knowing, and the universal feeling / reacting, this Cosmic Trinity, this Cosmic Law of right action and seeking that from that point we see all things must be added to ourselves because all things are basically ourselves. In essence they are ourself and (gap in tape, new section)&hellip; 1:06 (gap in tape, new section)&hellip; present in the whole of creation and the white is cosmic consciousness present in and out of creation. Now this takes time and we have to work with it, got the idea now? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: This light here is never extinguished, this is an eternal light, why? It can be validated by scientific laws, we can take certain electrical probes attach it to the brain and it has enough electrical power to light up a physical 25 watt bulb, one of those bulbs in that little thing there and if it was possible for them to shut off all the lights and let one alone shine, you will see how much light that the thing throws out let alone when it&rsquo;s vibrating within here because we cannot stand the fullness of it constantly exploding inside, it will be too bright, too brilliant, the mere physical sight couldn&rsquo;t stand it after awhile. That&rsquo;s why the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehends it not, the light is shining in the uninformed brain of Man and the uninformed brain of Man doesn&rsquo;t know how it works but then the informed brain is informed about what it&rsquo;s going on, there is no more darkness there, it&rsquo;s all light. 1:08 Audience: Do you have to practice it? Adano: The meditation? Audience: No, no, that&rsquo;s not what I meant. When you meditate how long does it take you to see this light or is it instant to you? Adano: For some people it&rsquo;s instantaneous according to their evolution or their capacity to slow down and watch, that is they don&rsquo;t have this drifting problem of drifting to some idea concerning past or drifting to some idea concerning future, they are able to stay in the Now, they are able to hold on and apply volition, all of this takes time because they have been subjected to too much environmental pressure, too much frustrations and insecurities that they drift about too much, but they in turn master it and the time lapse is not so important because it&rsquo;s very little price to pay for that accomplishment, do you follow? So don&rsquo;t worry about the time problem, be more concerned with the fact that you can look in and know it is there&hellip; Audience: When you see this light do you one light first and then you go into deeper into meditation do you get another color of light? Adano: Look at that light there but if you look intensely it will give you three colors, it&rsquo;s like the flame of a match, anybody got a match? (Adano lights a match.) Now the flame is there burning within the consciousness but don&rsquo;t you see the blue, don&rsquo;t you see the gold, but the white ash is coming up gradually in the center as a red glow? 1:10 Yes it&rsquo;s there, going on in us. It&rsquo;s all there already but it&rsquo;s your ability to watch as your vigil, it&rsquo;s your internal vigil that begins to differentiate but it surprises you so don&rsquo;t try to pin it down, when it happens it&rsquo;s a revelation. The joy and the happiness that comes from it being present and emanating, it&rsquo;s like Mr. Grissom in one satellite trying to lock onto to Carpenter in the other, you know what I mean, the two were trying to dock into each other. Your consciousness is trying to dock into to God&rsquo;s consciousness and light. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Yes, like I showed just now. Yes, alright well let&rsquo;s look at it again, turn the light off and let&rsquo;s look at what we&rsquo;re looking at. You saw how it all broke out in one big flare and then eventually appeared in colors and look what&rsquo;s coming out in the middle, the white, but the white is the stem going down that stem, the very source of existence, the supporting power that is maintaining the light. Do you get the picture now, why the white is the central thing? The two, the gold and the yellow, are the constant outflow in manifested world but the white is the sustaining force beyond and at the same time in it because it has to maintain the other two by burning. 1:12 A match, the very fundamental truth is there, we&rsquo;re looking at it all the time, the same is here as it is in heaven means as it is in the atomic structure &ldquo;so it is on earth&rdquo; so it is in the physical illustration there cannot be a conflict in God&rsquo;s truth, truth is truth, it&rsquo;s there. Audience: You have to work to see this light though, there has to be a lot of practice to get to this point. Adano: Let me put it this way, there&rsquo;s got to be lots of love on your part to want to look inside and work means strain and I don&rsquo;t tell you that you have to strain, work to me indicates strain, tension, that means you may want to look for tranquilizer but lots of love means enjoy, surrender, devotion. This is how the great Sages and Saints were known for devotion, the love for the light that shines within themselves so Jesus taught love but He didn&rsquo;t taught work but He gave you a reference point where you can bring the love to and it is this as the most amazing thing because the love flows naturally whereas tension or working or straining to see it or coercing it cannot come naturally. Audience: Yes that&rsquo;s what I meant, you have to get rid of all tension before you can achieve the point that you&rsquo;re at, do you understanding what I mean? Adano: Well let me put it this way&hellip; Audience: You can&rsquo;t see that light with any tension. Adano: Yes you can at times, you cannot restrict God only to one principle, He must satisfy conditions of all forms but it&rsquo;s not the established way. He must satisfy the dying man who is totally stressing or He must satisfy the man in an accident, you see, let alone the man who is healthy, He must satisfy the ill man in an asylum let alone the baby that is born. 1:14 But that is the important thing about it is that we don&rsquo;t place no limitation as to the universality of this principle, we must be able to realize that God is all-present, all-manifesting, this life is manifesting but it&rsquo;s manifesting more for the person in love but sometimes that love can only be accelerated or achieved by suffering. Not that the Creator want us to suffer, It doesn&rsquo;t want us to suffer, It wants us in fact to realize Him through joyous effort but suffering can be the only lesson that this mechanism will accept before it would really want to look in. Audience: Sometimes. Adano: Sometimes, not all the time, right so love is the thing you see. To love to want to be in oneself in other words &ldquo;I love to be by myself,&rdquo; is another statement, &ldquo;I love to be by myself,&rdquo; that means I love to look inside in other words I&rsquo;ve got a portable TV set going on in my brain. I think Kay here has a little grandson who you told you had a portable TV set, you want to tell them the story? Audience: You tell them&hellip; they had a television between them and they were on the same station and they were quarreling. Adano: And they were quarreling, two boys, and she says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go and meditate&rdquo; and she said to one boy &ldquo;Come and see the TV set that I&rsquo;ve got&rdquo; and he went to meditate and he begin to see. 1:16 Audience: Well he saw it and I told him&hellip; Adano: When she was meditating, he saw this light coming out and he was a young kid. Audience: I just wanted him to shut his eyes and be still and he started seeing. Adano: Then he started to describe it to her so he realized he was seeing a different TV than his other brother outside was looking on TV. Audience: His older brother that he was quarreling with. Adano: So from then on that was his portable TV, he could change the station any time he wanted but he had an inner sense of love, he didn&rsquo;t question or fear to try. This is why they say, &ldquo;Suffer not the little children to come unto Me, be as children&rdquo; in other words surrender through a loving attitude makes it a whole lot easier than to strain and as I said the tranquilizer is only to push back the strain, you understand? We don&rsquo;t want a tranquilizer to push back the strain, we want to be conscious of a natural effort that is there through the will. 1:18 Yes? Audience: I&rsquo;m studying another Swami&rsquo;s meditation and I got into an indescribably beautiful state of feeling as though a power greater than I wanted to take over. (Inaudible), you mentioned letting the Divine take over, is this part of the feeling that you&rsquo;re losing control? Adano: Well you see the five senses tries to maintain order in everything it does and maintaining order means having it under control as far as the brain is concerned, as far as the human being is concerned. If everything is in orderly fashion as far as the five senses are concerned, &ldquo;I am in control.&rdquo; A sensation and an awareness that has unlimited capacities, no boundary lines but it&rsquo;s vibrating through your mechanism, your five senses cannot exert control, your five senses would have to learn to adjust so when we say &ldquo;letting go, let God,&rdquo; we are actually saying learn to adjust to the pull of it. Audience: Well I have a definite conviction that I was going to lose control, I mean it was a beautiful feeling. Adano: Yes, well you see the thing is this, you never really gonna to lose control, this feeling is subconscious because we like to have our thumb on everything, we like to have things under our thumb and the sensation of the ego is that this cannot give up and let a free flow go through us. Audience: But she was losing her ego. Adano: Now in a sense it&rsquo;s like this, let&rsquo;s say someone gave you anesthetic, ether, there is a loss of control of sensation in the body but where have you gone, what real control has been lost? 1:20 None, what has really been lost is the association with feeling in the body but that doesn&rsquo;t say it was lost, all that really occurred is that your sense of feeling was slowed down to a point where you couldn&rsquo;t recognize it was still working for you because it was outside the range of your normal recognition and if that was happening when this feeling of joy was coming in and it was starting to take over the cellular structure, what sensation felt it was giving up it wasn&rsquo;t giving up, the body would have gone into a state of suspended animation, permanized with this blissful feeling, you would never have lost anything. So it&rsquo;s like you ever have a foot go numb and you try to wake it up, what is the feeling in you, don&rsquo;t you feel like you&rsquo;ve lost control but have you really lost control? Now if this particular condition was joyful, have you ever had your foot go numb and it was joyful? It was always a discomfort but you said this condition was being joyful so you see there couldn&rsquo;t be a real loss, it would have been an awakening and a revelation to something higher in yourself. Audience: Well would it be something like going to sleep? Adano: Yes, but you wouldn&rsquo;t be totally blank, it would be the first time you would experience spiritual trance or suspended animation, in other words you would experience what some people experience in sleep walking, in other words you would be experiencing a suspension of the association with the surface area of the body and at the same time maintaining a joyful feeling in that body and at the same time the awareness of yourself seeing what is occurring within that body. 1:22 Audience: Well I resisted it because I was afraid. Adano: Well naturally, it&rsquo;s like a man trying to resist death, death is also a joyful feeling when it comes but it also brings the association of numbness, it can also be a horrible sensation for some people who are seeing their life experiences playing back in front of them and at the same time the numbness is coming on but the great Masters say unless we pass by way of death&rsquo;s door in the human body and understand it, we&rsquo;ll never understand what is happening in God&rsquo;s realm. So that is what we have to realize, that it is nothing that you are losing, you are gaining. Audience: And when I had resisted I got some pretty bad complications so I don&rsquo;t know what to do when I get to that point again, can you slow it down or stop it? Audience: Is there such a thing as this thing that is called possession when one would be meditating, there&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t be, could there? Adano: No, no. Audience: Could there be physical pathology? Adano: Yes, this is one of its natural actions, this is its natural action you see but it&rsquo;s a blissful sensation, realizing what you&rsquo;re being aware of. 1:24 The mechanism is slowing down and you are losing association but at the same time the sensation or the feeling of joy is permeating it. Now the moment you resist it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re trying to exert back an association, you&rsquo;re impeding the flow of life through those cells, you&rsquo;re damming it up, resistance means to dam up, why would you resist if you didn&rsquo;t want to dam up or interfere with the flow, you see? Now the normal tendency to resist only stops or impedes the flow of life down in its natural blissful state. God is bliss, that is eternal life is blissful, flowing, free, natural health flowing all the time permeating us, radiant, life abundantly, anytime we feel that we are losing association it&rsquo;s because our ego through sensation wants to regulate that flow, follow? But this flow comes sometimes so fast there is no way to regulate it and our intense desire to resist it will setup an implication or a complication. Now if you don&rsquo;t resist, it&rsquo;ll flow right through. Now people who have had baptism of the spirit, when the priest lay their hand on their head, that energy just flow right through and they were lifted up off the ground some of them or they went right into a state of inner consciousness but they never lost anything, they gained something. So there is nothing to be afraid in it because your mind is centered on God already. 1:26 Audience: This is a natural reaction (inaudible). Adano: Yeah. Audience: Can you slow it down? Adano: That is why they say you must meditate, meditation helps you to adjust to its pull on your mechanism because you learn to live with the thing, you learn to adjust to its vibration, you learn to adjust to the impact of it. Audience: Well how long does one have to stay in that state (inaudible). Adano: It is not how long one has to stay, it has its own time cycle already there. In other words everything comes to pass, it doesn&rsquo;t come to remain. Audience: What&rsquo;s the usual time? Adano: (Laughing). I&rsquo;m not laughing because of ignorance, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m laughing at you because of ignorance, no far from it, I&rsquo;m laughing that the fact is Divinity don&rsquo;t tell you when He&rsquo;s coming (everybody laughs). You see the great Master Jesus says, &ldquo;You come like a thief in the night&hellip; the bridegroom&hellip; and you may not be&hellip; it may pass you on,&rdquo; you see so watch out, it&rsquo;s coming, this flow is coming through in relation to the five senses in the body but it&rsquo;s not going to tell you when it&rsquo;s going to come, it&rsquo;s going to come like a thief in the night. Does a thief tell you when he&rsquo;s going to come and rob you? But if you have a burgular alarm system you are prepared and even sometimes the burgular alarm system is not enough, you may have to have more. So this Divine principle does not tell you when its coming to flow in, it comes on. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: (Laughing). No one can say how long it will last, in some people it lasts for three days, in some people it lasts for forty days, some people four days, some people ten hours, and some people two seconds. 1:28 Audience: Well I mean could you get up and go to work the next day? (Laughter). Adano: I don&rsquo;t think you have to worry about it because you&rsquo;re own defense mechanism will automatically shut down. God already has a built-in defense mechanism you see, this Creative Principle is not an imbalanced law, every facet has already been preorganized. It&rsquo;s like trying to build a boiler with a safety valve already there from the time the steam builds up, it&rsquo;s released through the safety valve but some junior engineers get pretty scared when they see that steam building up and not knowing the safety valve is hidden somewhere and releases it. So pretty soon they go look for the senior engineer, &ldquo;Hey man, this thing gonna blowup, we better get this thing down&rdquo; and then they show them the little safety valve area. There&rsquo;s a safety valve built into us, you never get more than you can bear, even the scripture tells you that. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: No, no, you have a natural safety valve that shuts off. Now for instance you&rsquo;re speaking about the drug, can it give us Cosmic Consciousness? Let&rsquo;s see some of the symptoms of the drug. The drug in certain cases wear off after twelve hours but the first time someone takes it, he doesn&rsquo;t know what twelve hours may be. We may live our lives twelve hours doing nothing or doing something and think it&rsquo;s not that long but twelve hours under drugs can seem like twelve years. 1:30 Now in certain cases the drug may last for 24 hours, in some cases it may last for 36 hours or 72 hours but it can seem like one million years to that individual under the drug because he&rsquo;s trying all the time to gain control. Now let&rsquo;s say the drug only lasts for two seconds, still it will seem like a million years and here is another illustration. If you were sitting in the presence of your loved one for five hours straight and they&rsquo;re ready to part that brief moment of time would seem like five minutes to you but if you sat down for five seconds on a hot stove, it would seem like five years, you see? So when this sensation of peace is coming in, time relationship cannot be measured, it&rsquo;s a relative thing. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: A second can last a day, for instance we will meditate some more and we will see a time relationship in meditation and observe in the time relationship. Now close the eyes, go ahead close the eyes, every other person who has got a watch, I want you to time. We&rsquo;re going to need time, five minutes (Meditation)&hellip; 1:35 Ok, open your eyes, you see how long it took? Five minutes yet you felt you were in there for nearly an hour. How did you feel, less than five minutes? Audience: About five minutes. Adano: Alright, it didn&rsquo;t seem like an hour, it seemed like a short moment or a long moment, were you anticipating when we would say stop? Audience: It seemed like five minutes. Adano: Alright close the eyes and try to recall the length of your feeling. I&rsquo;m not going to tell you the time, you&rsquo;re going to try to measure yourself (Meditation). Ok, how you feel now in relation to the two periods? Audience: It seems like the first was longer than the second. Adano: But was the sensation any different? Audience: Not that I noticed. Adano: Alright, now the sense of waiting in that condition if no one tells you to stop automatically you&rsquo;re gonna want to exert control because you will always want to know when to stop it. 1:38 Now let&rsquo;s say you couldn&rsquo;t stop it because it was fixed already to turn off in an hours time by a certain drug but you were not told that the drug would turn off in an hour, you were told it would turn off in five minutes but it really didn&rsquo;t go off in five minutes, it went off in an hour, it would seem like eternity in there that five minutes. Now let&rsquo;s say the first five minutes was a little more than five minutes but the second five minutes was an exact five minutes, was the gap too far apart in the feeling of the two periods? How would you try to express it, one that big or one this big or one that big? Audience: The last one was approximately three fourths as long as the first? Adano: The first one was only two minutes, this last one was only two minutes, the very first one was actually five minutes, they were in actual count and it&rsquo;s strange that you feel a gap, imagine if this thing is carried in a drug relationship. Now the kids who take the drug or the individual who takes the drug, the sense of timelessness is so long that they can&rsquo;t seem to orientate to it. Because you knew this would go off in five minutes, you adjusted yourself to five minutes, the second time you didn&rsquo;t know how long it would last so you still had a sense of adjustment to it, right? But when I stopped it, you noticed there was a small differentiation, yet the actual figures, the differentiation would have been longer because the actual measurements show they&rsquo;re there. 1:40 Now in a drug after the first ten minutes under the drug it will seem now there is no end, you don&rsquo;t have no relationship for it to end and an hour passes and there don&rsquo;t seem to be no end but an hour seems longer and longer because you&rsquo;re becoming more aware of waiting for it to stop, you understand? The awareness, the tension, and the anxiety for the thing to stop would create this feeling, you understand? The anxiety would create this situation so what we are trying to say is this, it is not how long when this thing comes in that is important, the important thing is that you&rsquo;re prepared to work with it when you meditate, follow me? To be ready when it comes, to learn to adjust to it and not to fight it. Audience: I had Sunday afternoon to practice, I have no knowledge of how long it might last. Somebody out here in the audience says it might go on for days. Adano: No, no, in the first place when you&rsquo;re going to meditate you say &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m going to take a few minutes meditation,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re already preconditioned by data, you don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m going to sit down there and meditate, I&rsquo;m going to catch a few seconds meditation now. 1:42 So you&rsquo;re already setting up time principles in yourself, you&rsquo;re setting up the condition, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s Sunday, I might as well catch a meditation&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ve already set the condition so don&rsquo;t worry, you automatically are setting up safeguards in yourself, you are automatically are setting up your own natural safeguards so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. In fact, when the body reaches a certain saturation point, you can&rsquo;t meditate no more, you can&rsquo;t even sit in that position no more, you automatically come out of it, it stops by itself. Audience: That&rsquo;s what I wanted to know. Adano: Like this chemical, after it reaches a certain time span, it stops, there&rsquo;s no reaction no more, it wears off, there is a time limit in these things. In other words there is a natural time limit according to how the safeguards are setup. So in meditation you have a natural safeguard setup in it by your own programming. Audience: Thank you. 1:44 Adano: Let us meditate before we close our meeting. Now as you close the eyes, we are centering our mind on God, the eternal light and the eternal sound, and we are trying to bring our love for that light, we&rsquo;re not straining or demanding anything, we are actually trying to be conscious by love. Now the mind as I said before has a tendency to drift, it drifts to ideas concerning the past or it could drift to ideas concerning the future but we&rsquo;re not interested in the past because the past will create some tension ending as frustration and the future will create some tension ending as anxiety. We&rsquo;re interested in the present now, Beingness, this is unlimited. (Long meditation). Slowly open the eyes, try to hold onto the peaceful aftereffects. Thank you. Try to carry those peaceful after effects home with you. I hope you got the gist of what you&rsquo;re trying to work with, is it complicated or is it simple? It&rsquo;s something you just have to do.</p>
<h2 id="1969-april---part-1-easter-houston">1969 April - Part 1 Easter Houston</h2>
<p>Adano69_04_1EasterHoustonQ2RRNW6 - (Meditation). And this is the resurrection of Jesus and it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciples whom Jesus loved and said unto them, &lsquo;They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him.&rsquo;&rdquo; And she said &ldquo;Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept and stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other end at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.&rdquo; The Master Jesus did leave the frame and the angels are actually angelic beings in their astral bodies and &ldquo;one and the head and one at the foot&rdquo; is an indication of adoration and devotion. See devotion is at the feet, adoration is at the head, &ldquo;And they said unto her, &lsquo;Woman, why weepest thou?&rsquo; And she said unto them, &lsquo;because they have taken away my Lord,&rsquo;&rdquo; that is devotion and adoration has withdrawn the Master Consciousness. &ldquo;&lsquo;And I know not where thou hast laid.&rsquo; And when she said thus, she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus.&rdquo; In other words she was in the presence of the realized Master and His astral radial form and she did not recognize Him. &ldquo;Jesus said unto her, &lsquo;Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?&rsquo; And she supposing him to be the gardener said unto him, &lsquo;Sir, if thou have borne him away hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away.&rsquo; And Jesus saith unto her, &lsquo;Mary.&rsquo; She turned herself and said unto him, &lsquo;Rabboni,&rsquo;&rdquo; which means Master or Guru, &ldquo;which is to say, Master.&rdquo; In the Hebrew interpretation, Rabboni or Master or Guru means the same thing. In other words the disciple recognizes the Guru. &ldquo;And Jesus said unto her, &lsquo;Touch me not.&rsquo;&rdquo; Well this is normal for the disciple when he sees his Guru to want to touch Him, even to touch His feet because this is where the vibrations come or touch His hand or any part of His body or prostrate himself and touch the Guru. That&rsquo;s why He said &ldquo;touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my Father but go to my brethren and say unto them &lsquo;I ascend unto my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Which is to say He&rsquo;s still in a state of consciousness that is bordering between the vibratory and non-vibratory manifestation and the astral form is still pulsating with life. Now He did not want her to touch Him immediately because any negativeness on her part would have been transferred back to His body and kind of retard. It&rsquo;s like trying to touch wet cement, it would leave an impression. He wanted to reach the stage where this mechanism was in a state of curing or completeness. So He says &ldquo;I ascend unto My Father and your Father, My God, your God,&rdquo; which is to say that the same principle, the same Audible Life Stream that is passing through all of us draws us back up, we ascend through it. So go and tell His brethern, go and tell the disciples that He&rsquo;s ascending, make them conscious that He is with them. &ldquo;And Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for the fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them, &lsquo;Peace be unto you.&rsquo;&rdquo; You see in that resurrected form, having no negativeness in it, it can pass through all material substances and make itself manifest. So He manifested Himself to His disciples in the room and because the room was locked up, there was no way for Him to come through the door but He was able to pass through the wall into the room by consciousness because He realized that matter was only consciousness and that He was pure consciousness now and therefore it was no boundary line or no limitation to His consciousness where He can be and they were seeing for the first time in a new consciousness what the real consciousness of Jesus was in the room. They were seeing consciousness for the first time manifesting as energy and by saying &ldquo;Peace be unto you&rdquo; that is to free them from agitation or fear or restlessness or their own personal guilts and hangups that they were suffering from and their own personal fear of being persecuted by the Jews or the Romans at that time and they were in hiding at the same time so they had mental problems and they needed this peace to bring them back into harmony, into mental attunement with Himself. &ldquo;And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.&rdquo; In other words, He had to give them tangible proof of His reality that He was not an apparition or a mental hallucination and this would allow them now to realize that He did transcend the limitation of matter by consciousness and He was a fully realized Master and the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. &ldquo;Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you,&rdquo; in other words it&rsquo;s very important even at this stage although you&rsquo;re seeing this mechanism, whatever doubts are still in your mind, you must still transmit this peace to free the mind so that the true Soul nature of the disciples can perceive now their Soul nature of the Master standing in front of them. &ldquo;As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you,&rdquo; in other words the audible life consciousness and the life power that&rsquo;s manifesting in Jesus was not brought there by any ego, it was there to fulfill to the disciples that the Divinity was in Man and this is the same Divinity would have been projected back to them now as disciples to make them conscious of their own Divinity, that they too can achieve this realization. 0:10 &ldquo;So I send you,&rdquo; that is to say &ldquo;I now make it possible for you to realize where you are, make it possible for you to make the same effort to get there.&rdquo; &ldquo;And when he had said thus, he breathed on them,&rdquo; this is very important, He breathed on them, that is He granted them another initiation, a new another level of awareness and at the same time He took away a great deal of karma from them because &ldquo;God breathed into Man the breath of life and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; Now when a Master can breathe upon His disciples or project this, it&rsquo;s another form of initiation, this Holy Breath, this Holy Consciousness can now free the disciples of many levels of karma and make the consciousness clearer. In other words it&rsquo;s like blowing away the dust from a dirty object, the Master has blown away the psychological karma by His consciousness off his disciples by breathing on them. In other words He&rsquo;s granted them another level of initiation. &ldquo;And said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; prepare now to absorb the audible life stream, He granted them initiation again, bringing them closer into the audible life stream or the Cosmic Sound or Holy Word or Holy Spirit. In other words the Holy Spirit is involved in sound, Its involved in breath, and when a Master transmits it, you are linked up to it and therefore your whole mechanism now is transformed but it took that much time preparation for them to get there, to get that particular gift. They weren&rsquo;t ready for it before and He had to eliminate it from them and this elimination or this bringing down of the Holy Spirit on these disciples of His was a way of showing His concern for them. It wasn&rsquo;t for the people outside He did it, it was just these disciples because He knew these disciples had to go out and carry on this work, these disciples had to be able to lift up themselves to lift up others. So they themselves needed the first cleaning up, they needed the focusing of the Holy Spirit in them. It&rsquo;s like a cup, you can&rsquo;t pour anything into the cup until you clean it out if it&rsquo;s dirty and since the consciousness of the disciples were clouded, He could not bring down the Holy Spirit into them and infuse them unless He cleared up their doubts and in breathing upon them, it symbolically of clearing up the mental doubts in their consciousness and transmitting this energy or cosmic vibration into their bodies so that they can now radiate it. &ldquo;And he said unto them when he had breathed the breath on them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; accept this energy, this is your definite life. &ldquo;Whose soever sins ye remit,&rdquo; now you got the power, whoever karma you remit, whoever sins you remit, whichever person&rsquo;s karma you meet now &ldquo;they are remitted unto them,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re cancelled out. So you see Jesus didn&rsquo;t come to save the sins of the world because He&rsquo;s passed on now and He had to transfer His knowledge, He had to transfer the Holy Contact, who is He going to transfer it to but His disciples to whom which He was training and by giving them the same authority, the same power of consciousness now like Him, He was giving them ability to carry on the work. So He said, &ldquo;whose soever sins ye remit,&rdquo; whose soever karma you come in contact or cancel out or take on, the Guru takes on the karma of the disciples, this is called sin, these sins, these karma are remitted unto them, it&rsquo;s cancelled out. &ldquo;And whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained,&rdquo; that is to say which karma is not being paid off or held in check until time is due, that particular karma for that individual is held. Some people come, they are very egotistical and would like to be forced to have their karma removed or like to see demonstrations of removal of karma, these type of people He&rsquo;s telling His disciples in a way are retained, held back, don&rsquo;t do nothing, stop, cut open their ego and hold them in check, let them learn their lesson. &ldquo;But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.&rdquo; Well this has two meanings, one meaning is that we may say that Thomas was a cynic and outright in disbelieving or doubting and this would be the layman&rsquo;s interpretation of Thomas and this would be a classification you would give to Thomas that he was a doubting individual, very skeptical in every form, cynical type of individual, but in the higher truth it was not so. Thomas was a very scientific minded individual and knew the difference between hallucination, mesmerism, hypnotism, operation because it was very prevalent at the time as ESP is very prevalent today and many of the Jews in those days dabbled in it so they were well versed in it to the extent that Thomas wanted now the real truth, a real mystical fact, a real transcendence of consciousness over matter, not just consciousness over another person&rsquo;s consciousness or the mere figment of imagination to say &ldquo;well I saw such-and-such a person,&rdquo; but you have no way to prove it. Thomas wanted something from a scientific aspect, he wanted the reality, so from his realization and knowing the structure of matter and its qualities and knowing from his study of meditation with the Master Jesus, he wanted to be positive that this was not just another figment of imagination that if resurrection was a reality or it was just another mental concept. Therefore he says &ldquo;I will not believe until I have the proof&rdquo; and after eight days again, you see how long it took? Eight days His disciples were with Him, that same building, Thomas was with them, then came Jesus. Now eight days after resurrection, eight days after crucifixion, where is the body of Jesus, where is it walking, where is it eating, where is it living, is it an apparition? An apparition may only, or a haunted place may only, have occasionally something happen at night and somebody say that saw some kind of a gossamer looking thing, but here is something it&rsquo;s not happening at night, it is happening in broad daylight and it&rsquo;s got to be a whole lot difference. &ldquo;And Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.&rdquo; His greeting again is significant at the period and at the time of the day and in the same building. Now if you say the building is haunted then what time of the day was it being haunted, you see, and if it&rsquo;s haunted would the message be the same thing, &ldquo;Peace be unto you,&rdquo; &ldquo;why the hell don&rsquo;t you get out of this place.&rdquo; This would be the normal way a ghost would come to anybody to scare the living daylights out of them, he wouldn&rsquo;t want you to have any sense of reality or peace. So the experience is of a high spiritual nature. &ldquo;Then said Jesus to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big difference in that statement knowing now that it was not doubting Thomas, &ldquo;be not faithless.&rdquo; 0:20 Man&rsquo;s faith is often shaken by doubt but that does not make a man faithless. A man is only faithless if there is no evidence as to the reality of his spiritual development, then there is a condemnation as to what efforts he&rsquo;s doing, so there&rsquo;s a big difference between a man is faithless and a man is doubtful. You can have doubt and you still may question, but to be faithless is to say that there is absolutely no way to prove anything, you see, and if there is a way to prove something then faith is always there, faith is something has a chance to grow now, it grows from the evidence of things not only seen or believed but evidence from the things that are inherent in the person&rsquo;s consciousness that he intuitively feel is there and now has a chance to express itself, this restores faith. If it can&rsquo;t by any form of intuition manifest itself then it will become faithless, there would be no faith, without intuition you could not establish this faith. So Jesus is saying to Thomas not to be faithless is not to let his intuition fail him and what he intuitively feel about what is happening in front of him is genuine so learn to rely on your intuition and not on your intellect or reason and believe, &ldquo;be not faithless but believing.&rdquo; Now believing is not necessarily the mere fact that you accept something without question because true belief is to know and true belief is not superstition. So Thomas was experiencing true belief by trying to know for the first time what actually took place in the life of Jesus, whereas the others might believe but not fully comprehend but because they want to be not left out in the crowd, they would not appear to question the Master. Now when you never question the Master as to what is happening, you never really know for sure what you are receiving is genuine. You may only go so far in your comprehension and this is what you would accept as happening as truth from a Master, but if you do question without any form of ego in a true sincere questioning, then real faith, real understanding begins to manifest. That&rsquo;s why we question not for the sake of tearing down the Master or for the sake of trying to prove that we know something or we have any better answer, we only question in relation to get a better understanding of what we are experiencing in order to direct ourselves actively when we are using it. &ldquo;And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.&rdquo; First &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; is indicative that this is the true Guru, this is the Master, this is the one who has demonstrated through physical power by living in the physical body and transcending death, but he who can transcend death in a physical body must be God. Two things are equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another. So the Lord and God, the Guru and God is one and the same thing made manifest in the human body through the experience of discipleship we see the reality of it by being exposed to it, otherwise there is no relationship between the disciple and the Guru let alone to accept the Guru as a living proof of God. So our first realization is &ldquo;He is Lord,&rdquo; Lord of himself, Radha Soami, Lord of the Soul, and then on top of the bargain, He is God manifest the whole creative process because wherever it is going to be possible for the Creator to manifest, it would be to the extent He is Master over death because God is total life, total audible life and there is no death in life. So the Guru is a living example of God in life in form or matter, bringing the disciple back by the same process. So the Guru must bestow on the disciple that inherent knowledge, that inherent power, equal unto Himself. He could not make that disciple less than Himself, He has to give him exactly the same thing. &ldquo;And Jesus said unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&rdquo; This is a way of admonishing the disciple that both aspects of realization are valid. We must question, we must have evidence, but we must not be gullible just to believe and not question and to say it is blessed to have believed and not seen, that is to say if the intuition is capable of transcending reason, that you can perceive within yourself and know that this reality is possible and that this reality has occurred, this inner realization is blessedness. To see the Guru outside of you is one, to see the Guru inside of you is greater because your whole meditation primarily as you advance in the years is to see Guru inside of you, to see God inside of you. Not so much to see God as the human form outside which has made it possible for you to recognize or grant you the initiation or grant you the instruction how to look inside because that&rsquo;s what initiation is to show you how to look inside and what to look for. The great realization is after you have done that and then begin to see the Guru inside and the Guru is always present there when you go inside and make the effort to go up into yourself, make an effort to separate yourself from this physical body, He will always meet you there and take you on further inside of yourself, this is the blessedness, this is more important, you see, but this is not going inside by sheer belief and blind faith, this is going inside with the knowledge that this is the way back to God, that&rsquo;s a big difference than thinking is supposed to be the way back. There&rsquo;s a big difference between supposing it&rsquo;s the way back inside by looking inside than realizing this is the only true way back because there&rsquo;s no other way outside to bring you back, you see, and this is to make you realize that what you see outside is not everything, though it is tangible evidence to a certain extent but it&rsquo;s limited evidence, it is going inside where the true belief begins, where the true knowledge begins, the true evidence of understanding begins, this is infinite, this is unlimited, this is blessedness, this is grace, this is freedom that you can know, shut your consciousness, and transport yourself in. &ldquo;And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.&rdquo; Now it shows that a Master, even after having done certain things to satisfy the disciple, still keep on doing many more tangible things to satisfy the disciple because it&rsquo;s not so easy for the disciple&rsquo;s mind to grasp the significance of permanency of life after death. No one can tell you what exists after death if you never come back to tell you and whatever anyone would come back to tell you after death may still be a hallucination as far as you are concerned, you have no way to prove it because you never walk out beyond the door to see what is over on the other side of the scale and you have a living example telling you words are not sufficient, evidence of the body is not sufficient. 0:30 There must be more tangible signs in order to impregnate and impress this consciousness that is so saturated with the limitation of the world around it in order to free it from those limitations to comprehend the reality, the eternalness of the spirit beyond the grave, this requires more signs or more demonstrations of that spiritual nature. So if the books cannot record these signs and what makes reference to it, it stands to reason that many of these signs we may not even begin to comprehend or have no true inner knowledge of comprehending it unless we are going to experience it ourselves. There would be no sense of writing down these experience for people who have no understanding of it, let alone not having an opportunity to experience it but yet nevertheless to make reference that it was there and it did happen, you see. &ldquo;But these are written,&rdquo; those signs, those conditions that were experienced were written down, &ldquo;that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.&rdquo; Now this statement is very particular &ldquo;but these were written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo; Now they did not say that you might believe that Jesus Christ is the only Son of God, big difference, it is written that you might believe or it is written so that you may understand the structure of creation that the man Jesus is the Christ, that the man Jesus achieved the Christ Consciousness and that the Christ Consciousness IS the Son of the Creative Consciousness and that every man who attains Christ Consciousness has retained or identified his true Son-ship with God. So every Master IS Christ manifesting back, not Jesus, every Master is the Christ, is that Son-ship, is that particular level of development that is inherent in the God Consciousness that Man will see all the time. &ldquo;And that believing ye might have life through his name,&rdquo; have life through His name. When you believe that the living manifestation of a Guru is the Christ Principle which is the eternal audible life principle of God and the two things being the same thing, one is vibratory and one is non-vibratory and if you are fortunate to be initiated and drawn into it, you will have the same experience of eternal life. Believing in that name, not the name Jesus now, believing in that cosmic audible life stream, the Naam, the cosmic power that is passing through that Guru sitting in front of you, that same force that is coming down from the Cosmic Intelligence, God, and flowing through the body as the Christ Intelligence that is being transmitted to you as initiation, this principle, this link is eternal life all the time, manifesting all the time. So every time a Master lives on the earth plane, He is manifesting this three-fold principle: God, the eternal life, Christ principle in the body form as Master-hood, and the transference to the disciple in initiation as the Holy Spirit, a link from there to here to there all the time. So &ldquo;none cometh unto the Father but by Me, &quot; you got to pass through this mechanism, you gotta pass through this link, you see, and in His name, not Jesus name, in the name of the Christ Principle present in every living Master, does the disciple return back to the Creative Intelligence through that link-up, through that name, through that cosmic sound, through that cosmic meditational contact of initiation are we drawn back through this filter, which you call the Christ Principle in man, back into the pure Cosmic Consciousness. Now here is an object, we have right inside here the film which we can call the Creative Intelligence and we have a filter here to hold the light in and we have an object through which we photograph. Now this lens here passes the light, you press the switch, the picture is recorded, but if it doesn&rsquo;t pass through that lens, it cannot record on the film and this is exactly the same thing, &ldquo;no man come unto the Father,&rdquo; light of the image cannot be recorded on the film by exposing a film in front of it &ldquo;except by Me,&rdquo; except it passes through a filter, except it passes through a lens and a lens has to do with concentration, focusing. So no man&rsquo;s consciousness, no man&rsquo;s liberation, can come to him except he passes through a Guru, or a Guru&rsquo;s consciousness, or a Christ consciousness present in a Guru who is the living Lord and who is God at the same time manifesting as form. So it is this that Jesus is emphasizing, when the disciple wrote it, &ldquo;but these were written,&rdquo; these particular incidents were written &ldquo;that you might believe,&rdquo; that you may understand now that Jesus at that period is the Christ, has the Christ Consciousness present within Himself, the Sun of God, not the only Sun of God, the Sun of God, that this Christ Principle is the radiant light of God Consciousness, that all individuals who enter the Christ Consciousness they become Suns of God. Now Jesus Himself would say, &ldquo;know ye not that ye are gods?&rdquo; &ldquo;And as many as received Him, to them gave He the power to become Suns of God.&rdquo; Now &ldquo;as many as received Him&rdquo; and He says &ldquo;received the Holy Spirit&rdquo; when He came to them and He blew upon them and let them receive the Holy Spirit. He made it possible for them all to experience Christ Consciousness in themselves so that they awakened in their own nature to their own God-self, that&rsquo;s why they had the power now to go out and suspend karma of certain people or relieve the karma of certain people, that is they now had power over life and death. &ldquo;After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.&rdquo; It goes to show you that He stayed with His disciples for quite a long time, teaching them the reality of the Christ Consciousness in themselves, that they can go out and do something. &ldquo;There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples,&rdquo; these were all present with Him. &ldquo;Simon Peter said unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;And that night they caught nothing,&rdquo; they all went fishing but they caught nothing. &ldquo;But when the morning was now come and Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.&rdquo; You see even after He&rsquo;s manifesting Himself so many times to them after death, their minds were still clouded because the radiance of His countenance blocks out any identification of Him and He&rsquo;s standing there on the shore and they cannot recognize Him because His countenance is too bright. Their own limited mind cannot perceive outlines now, but then His voice, &ldquo;Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? And they answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.&rdquo; And then they realized their Guru was still with them, even in the smallest details of sustenance, even after death. So the Guru don&rsquo;t forsake you when He&rsquo;s gone out of the body, He&rsquo;s always with you. 0:40 &ldquo;Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher&rsquo;s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.&rdquo; Well here is the boat and there is the seashore and there is the Guru standing there and if you have any love for the Guru, the first thing you want to do is run up and greet your Guru because everybody is&hellip; see in India in all the pictures everybody trying to run and grab ahold of the Guru&rsquo;s feet, so the love of Simon Peter when he heard that this was his Master standing on the seashore, he didn&rsquo;t care how far the water is from the boat to the seashore, he just put on his coat and jumped in the water to go and meet the Guru, this is the love he has, and the other disciples came in with the ship, they rowed the ship in, &ldquo;(for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.&rdquo; Now they didn&rsquo;t make the fire, they didn&rsquo;t make the bread, and if the manifestation of Jesus after death was an apparition, bread and fire can&rsquo;t put itself together by no amount of apparitions, there ain&rsquo;t no ghost in this world that can put it together, you understand. So He has to be a realized Master, He has to have a form that is radiant, but it casts no shadow and leaves no footprint, but it&rsquo;s solid flesh and blood all the same and it can eat like you and I, this is liberation. And they said they saw fish laid on the fire and bread and &ldquo;Jesus said unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were too many, yet was not the net broken. Jesus said unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Where art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.&rdquo; Intuition now for the first time made them recognize that this was truly a Master, it is truly their own Master, no more questioning &ldquo;who are you, where were you, what were you doing?&rdquo; You see all that is gone now, consciousness is clean, they&rsquo;re for the first time in the presence of this love, this love is so great and &ldquo;Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.&rdquo; See He gave them many actual experiences, first He manifested and He spoke, second time He let them touch Him, the third time He&rsquo;s feeding them He&rsquo;s going to eat with them. Now a Master has said anytime a spiritual experience occurs and you see one of these Masters manifesting to you, these are the three tests you make. One, let Him talk to you and let Him show you His feet that you can see both feet together at the same time that you can reach out and touch. Second, He should be able to come up and embrace you. And third, you should be able to offer Him food that He would eat part of it and leave the other part and it don&rsquo;t rot after He&rsquo;s gone. Then you know you&rsquo;ve had a genuine experience with a Master, no matter what level you are, that this is your devotion and when you meditate, you meditate on all the Masters and which One wants to grant you His darshan, He alone comes and grants it. That doesn&rsquo;t say He has to be in the body or out of the body, this is the way they grant you darshan, this is the way they grant you their spiritual blessing, but your living Master will help you to get there too. He&rsquo;s there to open the doors, but these are the three things that are evidence of how to test these people or these real Masters when you get the experience. So Yogananda used to say, &ldquo;you can see all the Masters present, all who&rsquo;ve passed on, if you have the devotion and these are the ways you test them.&rdquo; Once a person says he&rsquo;s seen a Master, you ask him how many times he&rsquo;s seen this Master and what are the three things he&rsquo;s put the Master to the test or if he&rsquo;s just having a mental hallucination. You see the scriptures made sure, Thomas was a scientist, he made sure that these things were recorded, that we weren&rsquo;t being fooled. He wanted not only what he saw, he wanted to be able to feel, he wanted to be certain that that thing could eat like him and all three are here, all three tests. They first saw Jesus in the house, the second time they were given an opportunity to feel the body, the third time He&rsquo;s feeding them, feeding them solid substances. &ldquo;So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?&rdquo; Now here&rsquo;s the test, after you have all these evidence that this is a Guru, that this is a real genuine Master, then He&rsquo;s going to ask you the one big thing, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these miracles, do you love Me really as the living reality God, more than all these type of inner experiences, which you prefer?&rdquo; Now He&rsquo;s putting the disciple to the test. He gave the disciple the three proof that He was a Master, now He wants to see what love does the disciple want now, which is more important, these miracles, these particular inner experiences, these spiritual experiences, are they more important than the love for God? You see this is the test, that&rsquo;s why he says &ldquo;so when they have dined,&rdquo; He satisfied all their intellectual and physical problem now, He test them now their spiritual problems. &ldquo;Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. and he said unto him again,&rdquo; Jesus said to him &ldquo;ok if you love Me, Feed my lambs.&rdquo; If you really love Me and you don&rsquo;t care for these miracles, then render service to those around you, they&rsquo;re like lambs, they are searching for the truth, they are reaching out. Because a lamb is not easily excited, a lamb don&rsquo;t want no miracle to tell him that the shephard is nearby, you see. So &ldquo;if you love Me,&rdquo; if you truly love Me and you have no concern for miraculous things, you would be willing to render humble service now to all those who come to you for spiritual upliftment without utilizing miraculous things to make them understand themselves. So this is what He&rsquo;s trying to tell Peter now, &ldquo;wake up,&rdquo; if you really want to understand unconditional love, you really want to do something now, &ldquo;feel my lambs&rdquo; means render service, take care of these devotees, and see that they understand the truth about themselves without resorting to miraculous principles. And &ldquo;He said to him again the second time,&rdquo; first He&rsquo;s testing him physically of his love, now He&rsquo;s testing him again the second time mentally of his love, &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He said unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.&rdquo; First it&rsquo;s physical, &ldquo;I love you Lord! Why are you getting over aggravated, I love You,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the psychological part. And He says, &ldquo;Feed my sheep.&rdquo; The lambs was first and second was sheep, physical things are childlike, people who start out in search of truth are like lambs, they don&rsquo;t know, they don&rsquo;t question, there&rsquo;s no argument. 0:50 Intellectual people question therefore the second level is in the mind now, &ldquo;if you love me feed my sheep.&rdquo; I want to know now deep down in your own mental makeup now if you really love Me and you don&rsquo;t have no reservation to mentally question then you can cope with those people who will question you as to what you&rsquo;re teaching. So take care and look after the people who come to you, like sheep now they&rsquo;re gonna &ldquo;baaaah,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re gonna try and bark you down or bray you down until you prove things to them. &ldquo;And he said unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s testing him now spiritually. &ldquo;Peter was grieved,&rdquo; first it was a physical test, &ldquo;Yeah I love you Lord, why should I not?&rdquo; The second time &ldquo;but Lord I love You,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re reaching now to the psychological nature, but you don&rsquo;t get grieved. He says the third time Peter was grieved, you are hitting the whole spiritual structure of the man now. &ldquo;Am I really warranting the love of my Master? Is my Master really testing me or something? Now I&rsquo;m getting at the very core of myself. Am I losing His love for me, am I going to lose His grace?&rdquo; This is really getting you in turmoil now. What is he going through after all this, what am I going through now? So &ldquo;Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things,&rdquo; Guru you know, you know if I love you or not, you know mentally, physically, and spiritually if I love, why are you asking? It&rsquo;s like Ananda Moyi, who met Yogananda, Yogananda asked him three times if there were fishes sick people in Switzerland or not and he says &ldquo;yes there were&rdquo; and the fourth day when he go to ask him the same question before he could ask him the question, &ldquo;Yes there are sick people fishes in Switzerland.&rdquo; He started to say it like a parrot, you see, it&rsquo;s the same here. &ldquo;All things thou knowest that I love thee. And Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep.&rdquo; Now the second time sheep, the third time sheep, and the first time lambs. There&rsquo;s a big difference, a lamb don&rsquo;t question, it accepts full surrender, a sheep questions and the full grown sheep is mature and can handle itself but it need guidance. A spiritual person after he has come home to a certain understanding, he&rsquo;s mature, all he needs is a certain guidance and he&rsquo;s free. He said &ldquo;Feed my sheep. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest,&rdquo; just like the sheep, &ldquo;but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the sheep now. See when you are young, the lambs walk where they want and you have enough gumption and ego you get up and walk where you want and when you are old, like a full grown sheep, you need a sheepdog to guide you where you&rsquo;re supposed to go, you need someone to gird you or guide you along, you need direction more so than when you were young, follow me? Because you&rsquo;re liable to make more mistakes when you&rsquo;re advanced because every mistake can be detrimental because you know, whereas when you&rsquo;re young you don&rsquo;t know and therefore you&rsquo;re forgiven. When you&rsquo;re mature you&rsquo;re supposed to know and supposed to be able to discriminate and select so you don&rsquo;t make mistakes so you need guidance. &ldquo;This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?&rdquo; See Jesus was speaking to Peter and behind Peter was John and &ldquo;Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?&rdquo; Well Jesus was giving counsel to Peter by saying &ldquo;if you love Me, after you&rsquo;ve had all these experiences, if you love Me, do the work, go out and teach.&rdquo; Now Peter realized that he had tremendous devotion but also realized that this other man had an inner communion with, or inner link with the Master, this man would have no outward work to do, but this is not really true, this is Peter&rsquo;s way of thinking. Hear how the Guru answers him, &ldquo;And Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow me.&rdquo; Now this is very very mystical statement, very very mystical, it&rsquo;s not a literal statement because it was taken literally by Peter. This is Peter&rsquo;s literal understanding of that statement, &ldquo;Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die.&rdquo; You see this was the literal understanding of the statement when He said &ldquo;if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow me.&rdquo; Now before He made this statement and before Peter made any request, Jesus was describing to him that he&rsquo;s young he had his own way and when he&rsquo;s old he has to guided and Peter literally took that as the way he was gonna die. So if that&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s gonna die, then he says &ldquo;this is to surely glorify God and when he had spoken he said unto him, follow me, and Peter thought this is the way he&rsquo;s supposed to die.&rdquo; So when he gets old somebody take care of him, not realizing that this has to do with spiritual principles. So he automatically, realizing that &ldquo;well here is my way of going out of this body, but what about this other guy, how is he going to go out of his body, what&rsquo;s he got? So when he asks he gets an answer and he jumps to the wrong conclusion, the wrong conclusion is that &ldquo;went this saying went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him,&rdquo; Jesus didn&rsquo;t say that unto the man, that he would not die, &ldquo;He shall not die; yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die,&rdquo; Jesus did not say that to the man, Jesus said &ldquo;If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow me.&rdquo; And this statement was assumed by the brethren that this man would never die, yet Jesus, it is pointed out here again in the next paragraph, Jesus never said that unto the man that he would not die. So it goes to show you that they do not understand this statement. If He never said that the man would not die, &ldquo;but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?&rdquo; This is a big difference, what does this statement really mean? This is the disciple which testify now, this disciple who is testifying, who is writing this thing, this disciple is the guy who everybody thought is not gonna die and this is the disciple who Jesus says &ldquo;if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee,&rdquo; this is the man who is writing. &ldquo;This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.&rdquo; But you see, the disciple to whom this statement was made, &ldquo;if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, follow me,&rdquo; this has a tremendous deep spiritual meaning. 1:00 It had nothing to do with physical body, is had to do with spiritual relationship. Jesus was the embodiment of pure intuition, the intuitive Christ principle in the body, and Peter was the embodiment of willpower in the human body, the driving force which is necessary to mold anything on this earth. Now John is Bhakti or love, devotion, and Jesus is saying &ldquo;if I will that he tarry,&rdquo; if I make it possible that his willpower stays in that state of attunement, that is to tarry, &ldquo;until I come,&rdquo; until intuition descends upon him, &ldquo;what is that to you,&rdquo; whose an embodiment of willpower right now. You, Peter, is an embodiment of willpower, not an embodiment of devotion and intuition, he&rsquo;s an embodiment of devotion because you are pointing out how devotion this man is to Me, you&rsquo;re the guy who&rsquo;s pointing out what is gonna happen to this guy and I&rsquo;m saying, I am the intuition, I am the Divine intuitive nature and you are willpower, but you are not intuition, you&rsquo;re not in that intuitive state and though he explains certain little things, where Peter traveled and where Peter went, but it does not explain the intricacies of the spiritual life because it did not have the devotion, it did not have the intuition, Peter was strictly willpower. Now Jesus is trying to point out to the will or in a higher understanding, intuition is saying to willpower, &ldquo;suspend yourself until intuition comes into you, then you will have both intuition and will and devotion,&rdquo; and every man must pass through this particular type of growth, he must have intuition, will, and devotion and if Peter was going to die the way he literally took it, that someone is going to lead him by the hand until he dies, we found out he didn&rsquo;t die that way either. He decided to be crucified upside down. Now why did he decide to be crucified upside down, the realization came to him after what the meaning meant, that it didn&rsquo;t mean that John the disciple would tarry until Jesus comes 1000 years from now and never die, it dawned on him that it didn&rsquo;t mean that no more because he started to picture the thing, he realized that he was an embodiment of will and will is an obstacle in the path of intuition and will must succumb to intuition, it must surrender to intuition so by choosing death upside down was symbolical of saying, &ldquo;I the will now has surrendered to intuition, the Lord in Man,&rdquo; and this was his way of symbolically dying, physically doing it to say &ldquo;well I realize now what is the truth, I am free,&rdquo; and in that way he chose an upside down death symbolically of his freedom and, in a literal sense, for those who did&rsquo;t understand because if you didn&rsquo;t understand in a literal sense, &ldquo;oh because he denied the Lord and the Lord died the other way, so he&rsquo;s gonna die this way just to be different, to show his respect to the Lord.&rdquo; He died upside down primarily to show, as an embodiment of will, it had to surrender to intuition which is Christ principle and that John, who was an embodiment of devotion, had to remain with that devotion and will in a state of attunement or tarrying until intuition descended into him and when it descended into him, then was he able to be a testimony or a witness of the things that occurred and record them. So John was then definitely the disciple to which all the inner mysteries of the Christ life became known because it will take intuition to convey to intuition the innermost secrets of the Christ consciousness, it could not take intuition to convey to the will what occurs because the will could never recognize intuition. A man&rsquo;s intuition is not recognizable by his will, it takes his intuition to recognize the higher intuition in himself, that there is a link. So when we look into God, we look into God not by will, but by intuition and devotion, then coupled by the will through persistency to stick with it. So we have all three flowing as one. So we see in the disciple John, a manifestation of all the forces for the first time and therefore Jesus was able to transmit to that disciple what He wanted to transmit. Thank you. (Gap in tape). &hellip; evolution he would have gone through and therefore you see Samadhi in its early stages looked just exactly with all the symptoms of a schizophrenic individual, it has all the symptoms of a schizophrenic and he&rsquo;s got all the symptoms of a person under LSD. Audience: Right I would feel that externally to a psychiatrist you would be a schizophrenic. Adano: But you see here is one thing about Samadhi, at a certain level of the experience, all forms of schizophrenia disappears and here is where Leary got mislead and thought LSD could give him superconsciousness because after that there is no&hellip; you see LSD can only give you a repetitive of the same one thing over and over, it is never nothing new. Audience: But you know when I look back I noticed how the spirit took all these matters into consideration and he knew what one event would lead to and the end result because he saw that people would take care of me, you see. Adano: Well you see this is what we call Divine Will, you see the thing is this, is to recognize what is your will, ego will, and Divine Will. You see there is a part in the scripture that says, &ldquo;nothing moves,&rdquo; or no-thing moves if you want to read it correctly you see nothing and automatically you think there&rsquo;s nothing, they should have put a hyphen between no and thing, &ldquo;no-thing moves except by Divine Will.&rdquo; In other words there is not a possibility in creation, or what we call manifested creation, to have its existence without the Divine Will moving it because he is moving the universe already, but it is this interplay between shadow and light. We are the shadow, He is the light, and you only can experience the duality in this cosmic conscious state, you cannot see it in subconscious state and you can&rsquo;t see it in drugs either, you can&rsquo;t even see it in schizophrenia, this duality, this interplay. That&rsquo;s why we say, &ldquo;maya is here&rdquo; or the illusion is here, you see, you have relativity here as a shadow and you have reality as a pure light shining through all the time. When it&rsquo;s happening to you at a certain level, only when you reach that level, and the level has to do with when you mentioned the perfume because I was waiting to hear when you were going to talk of this perfume. In all this conversation it didn&rsquo;t mean nothing to me until you said you started to smell perfume. Audience: That&rsquo;s why I wanted to know what you were doing Thursday because I was breathing (inaudible) all night long. Audience: This smell of perfume it lasted two days because even riding a subway or reading a book, when I come to a certain passage, it becomes intense, this intense fragrance. I look around, I wondered if somebody was carrying something. Adano: Well this is true, you see sometimes the Masters go into meditation and They go deep into Samadhi and they can flood this whole room with perfume. You see Master Yogananda sometimes He sit down in meditation and in two minutes He would flood the whole room with perfume and the funniest thing, one time I went to visit the ashram and one of his disciples was meditating upstairs, Sister Daya, and I wanted to see her and they told me I couldn&rsquo;t see her because she was in meditation, so I says &ldquo;ok, I won&rsquo;t disturb her.&rdquo; Walking along the hallway, this is what we call&hellip; if the person really has (inaudible) or the true Bhakti you see, or the true love, this kind of love is unconditional, it has no condition involved in it. At that moment when it starts to vibrate in the human tissue, that&rsquo;s the time this perfume starts to flow. 1:10 See God is pure love, but you can&rsquo;t see Him, and when you say you see His light, that blinds you, when you say you heard His voice, that drowns you out, but when you can smell Him your whole body starts to vibrate. So the unconditional love flows as the perfume all the time and especially in the form of a rose or sandelwood or jasmine, it gets so pronounced and when I was walking down the corridor, I can just smell the rose perfume just oozing out of our love in our meditation just coming down the hallway and I knew that she was making contact inside. Audience: You asked me about&hellip; you wanted us to tell him a little bit about you before we came and I said no because that was like (inaudible) telling us about Ananda Moi. The first time I knew him I didn&rsquo;t even know anything about the roses, but I opened the door to let him out and I smelled roses. Adano: It&rsquo;s always a Divine principle, the body is just a channel, that is why I think the best prayer I&rsquo;ve ever encountered yet is the one written by St. Francis. Audience: He wants me to write a friend, Dorothy gave me a Christmas card and it&rsquo;s beautiful and I told him&hellip; Adano: Because this makes you very conscious of the doer behind the act, God is the doer, God is the act, God is the action, and everything, His is the result but you see I know St. Francis was Yogananda you know, that was his past incarnation and the funny thing he was lecturing in Carnegie Hall, Master Yogananda, and all of a sudden he started to look back into a past incarnation and all of a sudden he saw himself as St. Francis lecturing in Assisi and he lost total awareness of his of the present in Carnegie Hall and the prayers and the vibrations and the meditation that came through, they thought here was a Hindu Catholic with an Italian accent and the lecture came right through and when it was over, they were flabbergasted the people at the time when it was over because you know that chant he says &ldquo;God, Christ, Gurus,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the time he composed that whole prayer, right there on the podium. Audience: Oh in the Carnegie Hall? Adano: Yeah in the Carnegie Hall. Audience: I almost fell to the floor because it was like I was thinking of this thing when I mentioned the atom, I could feel these words coming through saying &ldquo;the atom is the first symbol of unity&rdquo; and the minute I said it you know I could feel this bursting with spirit and it was like he was standing over and thought that something was going to happen, I could feel this anxiety and my heart was just beating and I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t control it, I just had to just stand there and hold onto something. This tremendous power, it feels like&hellip; the only word that I can really find to describe it is nuclear, I can only say it&rsquo;s like a spirit of nuclear power. Adano: Well Man is the Divine atom you see, the thing is the Divine atom because let me put it this way, here is vibrationless creation, that the highest level that the human consciousness or the human soul or Soul can reach that is vibrationless. Now you cannot comprehend vibrationless because you cannot merge in it because you automatically become vibrationless when you merge, you are vibration. So when you enter vibrationless, it&rsquo;s like a bubble popped and it becomes the water so there is no such thing now as to say me, mine, or thine because the whole thing is you, but then you find yourself in infinity. At this level all the Saints have agreed that this is the unmanifest level and it&rsquo;s the pure consciousness, pure God. Now that&rsquo;s why they call it God the Father, even resplendent, ever withdrawn from His creation, now we get the word rest so you figure out He can work with creation for six days and take off the seventh day as rest, but where&rsquo;s He gonna rest and go if He get away from His creation, the creation would fall down. So the word rest means that because creation is the result of vibratory action, everything we see as creation is all vibratory action, and it took six cycles, not six days in 24 hours, six cycles in this creative principle to bring these things into manifestation. Now the seventh cycle is a cycle of vibrationless, this is what you call the reserve force, this is the non-tapped or the non-used portion of the Divinity. In other words, Divinity is inexhaustible now, all that has been exhausted is only six cycles of it you see, we only can see this and this what we call Para-Braham, Sat Pusush in Hindu scriptures that He is in that level or the ocean of Amrita, that is the ocean of Divine nectar, this is the reservoir. Audience: (inaudible). Adano: So you have a blackboard and the blackboard means nothing until you make some inscription on the blackboard so the blackboard can represent the vibrationless and when you make some kind of inscription to communicate, that can represent the vibration, a symbol. So we are seeing a symbolic life in the form of vibration or creation, there is no symbolic life in God who is vibrationless because He is pure consciousness. Now pure conscious has no form, but pure consciousness must slow down into vibratory rates to become energy which is our electrical universe, which is our atomic universe. So the very first manifestation of this Creative Intelligence is the atom, we have no other way. Now this atom had to slow down to the point what you call crystallization or solidity, that is visible, tangible experience now. Now at this level of the whole polarity of the thing from vibrationless through vibration into solidity, we have the common symbols of religion: heaven / hell, HELD throw away the last &ldquo;L&rdquo; and throw away the &ldquo;E&rdquo; and call it HAVEN. You&rsquo;re HELD, everything is held in check now because where would he be sent to, he&rsquo;s not descending into a total infinity, he&rsquo;s descending from infinity, or reservoir, to finality which is held in check as a crystallization of himself. Audience: Well can you tell me if the word DEVIL spelled backward is that have any significance? I noticed that it is LIVED. Adano: Yes, until you have lived you don&rsquo;t know what life is, so there is no devil. See devil, in Sanskrit you have the word Maya meaning opposition, negative, illusion, relative, in science we have the word relativity or intrinsic resistance, this is what relativity really is, intrinsic resistance of matter. Now in Hebrew we have the word Satan, which means adversary / opposition, which is basically the same thing we&rsquo;re talking about. Now in the Sikh religion they have the word Kal, the negative charge, so we see that in the atomic structure there are more electrons than there are protons, there are more negative charges than there are positive charges in the whole of creation. So the Creator, which is pure protonic energy, must utilize his counterpart of intrinsic resistance in the form of negative charges. So we have polarity as the first indication of creation, we cannot escape polarity, it&rsquo;s a law. So we see the polarity being HELD in a crystalized form, not HELL now, people say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go down to&hellip;&rdquo; Jesus Christ descended into hell and the third day He rose again from the dead. Yeah He&rsquo;s been descending into HELL for many people but actually the consciousness is descending from its pure state into HELD, returning every moment back into infinity because this is a thing going on in all of us all the time. The Christ in you is intuition because you don&rsquo;t have a Christ sitting on a throne, Jesus was a highly evolved Master with His intuitive nature fully awakened and He had a 360 degree vision with a 360 degree understanding. 1:20 Now many of us don&rsquo;t have a 360 degree vision, let alone a 360 degree comprehension, but when the intuition is open you start to see the whole cosmic as it is, then you have that realization, then you start to see why they say you are a Sun of God because God is light and you are a miniature sun, you are a miniature light in this thing, you are a miniature atomic principle. Now it descends to a level called HELD, not HELL, but HELD, it descends to a level called crystallization or manifestation or concrete. Now it takes three days they say but we&rsquo;re not talking about three times 24 hours, we are talking of three levels of consciousness from a causal level, which is an idea level, to an astral or an electrical level which is second to a physical or concrete level. It takes these three levels of descent where the pure consciousness descends through these three levels which they call &ldquo;descent in three days,&rdquo; and you say it goes down in the grave or it&rsquo;s a grave thing to down to your physical body, you&rsquo;re so highly evolved up there, you know how it is to get back in your body, you didn&rsquo;t want to come out of that state when you&rsquo;re up there, this body was torture to you, right? This physical frame is torture when you&rsquo;re having an experience in cosmic awareness, this body is limitation because you are limited, you are held back, you cannot do anything in this physical frame, but once the consciousness is capable of descending down the three levels of idea, of electrical into physical, or you would say causal, astral, physical, once this energy can descend to the last level which you call hell or held, it&rsquo;s held in the concrete state now, when it descends there and stops, &ldquo;and on the third day He rose again from the dead.&rdquo; Now &ldquo;rose again from the dead,&rdquo; a physical thing in a state of concreteness is potentially dead, it&rsquo;s inert, it has no action until it is set into kinetic motion you see, until the intrinsic activity of resistance is not released, this thing cannot be active no more. So it has to descend, the consciousness does descend down into the negative state of crystallization or held, HELD not HELL, and stays there passing through the three levels of idea, electrical, and physical and then rising back up, that means this is a two way street between you and the Creator, you rise up back again by your devotion, you see this same intuition pulls you back up so you start going back up. Now they said on the third day He rose again from the dead, but it&rsquo;s not three times 24, it is within the three levels of creation this life principle returns back to a non-vibratory state. Now we see why it was returned to a non-vibratory state, if we take the little the little understanding of the resurrection, we see that when this woman went to the sepulchre, Mary, and she saw this Master coming out and she asked Him, she thought He was the gardener and she said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for lord Jesus&rdquo; and He called her by her name, &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; and she recognizes Him and she goes to touch Him. Now to touch a Master or spiritual person if you&rsquo;re a disciple this is a natural thing to do, a disciple loves to touch the feet of a Master because this is his&hellip; he realizes that this Master is the embodiment of spirituality in everything so he reaches out to touch. Now touching is a physical act and it&rsquo;s a crystallized act, now here is the admonition from the Master, &ldquo;touch me not, I have not yet ascended to My Father.&rdquo; Now why would He tell her that if He descended into hell three days and raised Himself from the death three days if that is the symbolical meaning of the thing. He is already pure consciousness that has passed through a physical, an electrical, and an ideational universe, all in one time / one shot till He comes down from the atomic principle right down and He&rsquo;s withdrawing Himself right back into non-vibratory state which is the Father, the reservoir. Here He&rsquo;s passing and a disciple who is locked up in vibratory existence so if this person touches Him, His body which is not fully aligned yet with the non-vibratory state will setup a reaction. That would be like wet cement is here and if you touch it you leave an impression, but let the cement dry, you can walk on it. He was passing through a certain level of awareness in Himself which would be interrupted in the process of motion from the physical back to the pure consciousness and in that moment He was encountering a disciple who, devotion was so great and wanted to touch Him, that He had to admonish that disciple but the disciple did not realize, the disciple may think He didn&rsquo;t want to be touched or anything in the disciple&rsquo;s mind, but in the Master&rsquo;s mind He knew what He was talking or doing. So He had to wait until a few days after to come to them and made Himself manifest to them and then He went through three tests to prove the solidity of His existence. The first test He came through the door and the door was closed, the second test He let somebody touch Him to make sure that He was solid and He was not a figment of imagination, and the third test He ate food. Now all the Masters have said this in Their writings and all those who have lived and are in the body, they say this is the only way you can prove a Master if He&rsquo;s a Master that He has entered this state, that when you have a meditation and you see Them, the first time they come they&rsquo;ll talk to you, but He said that his not enough, that is not enough proof that you are really there, you can still be a figment of imagination. The second time They come to you, they must be able to embrace You that you can feel and smell the perfume coming out of Their body and you remember Yukteswar and Yoganada in the Autobiography, he embraced Him, He says &ldquo;let go a little, you&rsquo;re holding Me too tight&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s holding onto his teacher and his teacher says &ldquo;Hey wait a minute&rdquo; and the teacher is a skinny guy and here&rsquo;s the student a big, husky, robust guy you know and I&rsquo;ll tell you Yogananda was a big, husky&hellip; he grabbed ahold of his teacher He says &ldquo;Hey wait a minute, you&rsquo;re squeezing too much&rdquo; and the third time the Master says when They come, They&rsquo;ll eat food with you and They will not eat all, They&rsquo;ll ask the food to be there and eat a portion and They&rsquo;ll leave a portion for you and that portion will never decompose. I have seen such food left by the Master, it&rsquo;s existing right in California now, a little shrine. The day He passed away you know, in 1952, a friend of His sent Him a little sweetmeat, you know what what a jelabi is? Audience: Yes very well, I&rsquo;m fond of it. Adano: Oh good, I&rsquo;m fond of a jelabi too. Audience: We&rsquo;ll make one when you come. Adano: Ok, well this jelabi is a little sweetmeat with honey and this friend sent Him a package of it so He had one in a plate and I was fortunate to go in the room years after to see it. Where He broke off the piece and ate and the piece that He didn&rsquo;t eat was still there in the plate not decomposing. Audience: Do they still have it there? Adano: They still have it there. Audience: I want to go to California. Adano: This is the proof that when you are in that state you see, that these qualifications do come into you. Now the Master says &ldquo;when it happens to you by devotion, like in the case of Saint Theresa you see, of Avila, or Saint Joseph, these were sheer devotion but it came on, the body sometimes could not stand the shock and only if you live in a religious environment where they understand these things then you have an opportunity to pursue it with your devotion and your meditations, but in a society like ours the first thing they think well you were on drugs or you&rsquo;re nuts or something and then before you know it they put a drug in you that actually destroys everything. 1:30 Audience: Well you know in my case it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of knowing what was going to happen next, this thing just came on in stages, it takes about three days. I was totally unaware of what was actually happening, I could just experience the states. Adano: Well you see the thing is&hellip; this is why I said when it comes to a person on its own by devotion, it comes in degrees. Now when a Master gives it to you, He gives you the whole shot, in other words you get the whole full thing and it may last you for hours. In the case of Yogananda, his teacher gave it to him and it lasted for 14-15 hours, so you can imagine what&rsquo;s happening in 14-15 hours in that state, you&rsquo;re going through creations upon creations, universes upon universes. Now when you can summon the thing yourself after meditation, then you take it in levels at the speed you can go, this is how it comes on. So it is a natural law, but the perfume is very important because this is the thing we are aware of that you have genuine experience you see because this is God&rsquo;s presence. Well I remember one time Master Yogananda was giving a lecture in the church on Sunset, you know near the restaurant? Have you been to&hellip; Audience: No, you mean Sunset Blvd? Adano: Sunset Blvd there&rsquo;s a church that&rsquo;s right there and he was lecturing one day right there and in the midst of the lecture he stopped and he closed his eyes and he went into this state and he flooded the whole room with perfume and when he came out and he said to the audience, &ldquo;the proof of God&rsquo;s presence is the perfume of His love,&rdquo; and everyone in that whole church smelt and felt that presence and they walked home and their family couldn&rsquo;t understand what type of perfume they were carrying with them, they were walking with it, it was going with them. He just demonstrated to them how God can flow through to them and that article was in one of the magazines and it was not until years after, this thing used to happen to me, this perfume you know, I&rsquo;d be meditating and this thing would flood all the room and I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;shucks I&rsquo;m losing my mind,&rdquo; after awhile some of these experiences are kinda way out there you know, you start to wonder, but then I picked up this magazine this day and I read it and I says &ldquo;no wonder the thing is happening.&rdquo; From then I realized that this is what we call confirmation, that you always need some human being to make confirmation of what is happening, that you&rsquo;re not off the beaten track, that you are getting genuine experiences. Audience: I read a thing by an Indian Yogi, &ldquo;contemplate anything in nature and it shall give up its secrets,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s as though I found a secret in nature that was always there and it seemed like this was a verification and I went from one stage of consciousness to the other because I felt as though nature took on a completely new meaning to me. You know at times I could stand in front of a fir tree or some beautiful scenic view and go to tears and other people would just come along and see things that stand in the way. Adano: Well you see the thing in this you have been a Yogi in a past life. You see I&rsquo;ve told Lucille a long time, I&rsquo;ve asked the Master this one request a long time, let only those that are spiritually His own come to me and that means people who have been on the spiritual path that I meet them, I&rsquo;m not interested to meet people who are not because I can&rsquo;t do nothing, I cannot help them. So all the people I have met so far have all, that I know personally from meditation, have all been on this path already and they just coming back to complete their evolution in this incarnation and this is the Master&rsquo;s wish, that the disciples meet those people who are ready to fulfill their life. Audience: There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to ask you, in the course of involvement in school I seem to lose this, they call it &ldquo;become a backslider,&rdquo; I feel as though I completely lose this spirituality, it&rsquo;s like it completely disappears and I feel as though I lost all consciousness of these experiences, only one when I reflect back, but once in a while as I&rsquo;m meditating unconsciously or reading some spiritual scripture, this light I can still feel every so often, it will return, and sometimes it becomes intense and sometimes you feel as though it&rsquo;s gone, sometimes it&rsquo;s so intense that you feel pain. Adano: Well the thing is this you see, spiritual people normally are not scholastic people, this is one of the phenomenas, you can&rsquo;t be intellectual and spiritual at the same time, one has got to suffer for the other. Now, but you see the Masters have done this, all the Masters have made the passing grade just to fulfill the formality of a scholastic education, but as soon as that formality was over, then their spiritual nature came you. You see in Yogananda&rsquo;s case he went through school just to get the mere passing grades to get a degree to say he went through in a scholastic way and Master Charan Singh, he&rsquo;s an engineer and a lawyer, but he never uses his engineering or legal profession to do anything, but the thing is this, his grandfather was a judge, you see, and all these teachers, they&rsquo;ve all had a scholastic career, but they went through, what you say, the mere passing grades possible so that they can fulfill what they call a secular life, or a social life, in the world, but the moment that spiritual nature came on to them to do their spiritual work, that part is (inaudible). Audience: I was wondering, one of the possibilities of this spiritual awareness of the spiritual journey because when you lose yourself in the academic world, I feel as though I&rsquo;m where I don&rsquo;t want to be or I would like to be in a spiritual environment where this thing would return because I feel as though I&rsquo;ve lost the path, it feels as though I&rsquo;ve deviates so far away, I often wonder will I ever return. Adano: Master Yogananda came to the west for this one purpose, to show and teach physical, mental, and spiritual coordination, not to develop like a one legged stool, but like a three legged stool, each leg being equally important, that&rsquo;s why he started this principle of meditation. We&rsquo;re in the world and we have certain obligations from our physical standpoint, we do them, but through the help of meditation we can do it easier and we have been strengthening the mind because we don&rsquo;t run from anything, we face things now. So most of his advanced disciples were men with tremendous business obligations, in fact his most advanced American disciple was a multi-millionaire, a man who today you only know him as Mr. Underwriter, the guy who made the Underwriter&rsquo;s Insurance. Well when he started out, this guy at the age of 17 was an accomplished accountant and at the age of 35 he was a multi-millionaire, but like this. When he met the Master he was ready to give up his millions to spirituality, but the Master didn&rsquo;t want his millions, the Master said &ldquo;keep your millions, keep on going as a businessman, but realize there is a balance, a bird don&rsquo;t fly with one wing, it flies with two wings, and there is a way to live in the world and not of the world.&rdquo; 1:40 There is a way to live performing your obligations at the same time maintaining a spiritual inner life, but it is only done by the discipline of day-to-day meditation, this balance is maintained. So you will never lose the balance if you maintain a day-to-day meditation. So he taught this millionaire man the our periods of meditation, between 3 and 5 in the morning, between 12 and 1 in the day, between 7 and 8 in the afternoon or 6 and 7 in the afternoon, and at night between 10 and 12. The man had regulated his life around these period and in the daytime at lunchtime he would shut up himself in his office and his secretary don&rsquo;t disturb him, and instead of go out to lunch he spend the whole hour inside meditating and since he lived a simple life, it made his nutrition very simple, he didn&rsquo;t overeat anything, he ate regular, but made it very simple and all through his life because I remember, I didn&rsquo;t get to meet him, he passed away before I met him but I met another disciple who was a doctor and this doctor lived his doctor&rsquo;s life and lived his spiritual life and it was a peculiar thing, on a Sunday he used to give this sermon at the church in Los Angeles and the first time I met him I went in the church, I never met him before so I went in the church and I sat down. I saw pictures of him and I know they said he was a very advanced disciple to Master and so I sat down in the room and I&rsquo;m waiting and the sermon started, the meditation and everything and then he came up to give the lecture. As soon as this man entered the room, this is the phenomena of it, you felt a tremendous electrical charge going right through the room and you smelled this tremendous perfume go right through the room and you felt your whole mind, no matter how restless it was, mine was pretty restless, it was like it was drawn right up and stuck here like a cone here in the top of my skull and could not take my eyes off Dr. Lewis. Now here he was standing on the podium, he didn&rsquo;t even begin to speak yet, and he looked all around at everybody as if he was looking at each one of us and his eyes came to me, I could feel he was looking right through me, I looked at him for awhile and then he started to talk. Well normally after he finished his lecture, he stands up at the podium and he grants everybody a darshan or an interview. So I walked up, I wait till everybody&rsquo;s gone out and I walked up to him and I introduced myself. He says, &ldquo;Oh yes, I know you,&rdquo; just like that and then he start telling me things about myself, then he says, &ldquo;I want you to come as often as you can&rdquo; and it was the funniest way he said it, he look at me with his eyes and when he said &ldquo;I want you to come as often as you can&rdquo; from his eyes telepathically the message came into my brain that he&rsquo;s not gonna live too long, just like that, and he was saying &ldquo;I want you to come as often as you can,&rdquo; but his eyes was projecting this thing and I thanked him and every Sunday that he lectured I tried to get back in to meet him and he helped speed up my meditation over the years, knowing he was going, I attended his lectures and meditation and he helped me a lot in my meditation, I was able to really meditate. Then one day, it was an Easter Sunday, and normally he lectures on Easter Sunday on the resurrection of Christ, every time, the true scientific principles behind it and the Wednesday before the Easter Sunday I&rsquo;m sitting in the room, I was in Los Angeles, and I was eating with a buddy of mine. Just about 3 o&rsquo;clock I said to him, &ldquo;Funny, I keep thinking of Dr. Lewis&rdquo; all of a sudden like that, I know I&rsquo;m going to see him Sunday at the lecture, but why should I be thinking of him now at 3 o&rsquo;clock Wednesday afternoon and I couldn&rsquo;t get him out of my mind. Later on on the Thursday, Friday, and on the Saturday I was making preparations that Saturday night to fix the alarm clock to get up exactly because the meeting starts at 10, there&rsquo;s an hour meditation from 10 to 11 and from 11 on he lectures you see. So I was trying to get there exactly at 10 o&rsquo;clock because you never get in at 10 o&rsquo;clock. You see there is two auditoriums, he can only lecture at the one above and the other one is below in the building and you can&rsquo;t see him, you just hear his voice, and I was trying to get there to be in the upstairs auditorium at 10 o&rsquo;clock. That night we went to bed and we set the alarm to wake up us exactly at 9 so we&rsquo;re all dressed, get up at 10 and go. I wake up Sunday, you know what time I wake up? Take a good guess, the alarm clock is set for 9 o&rsquo;clock, this is an electrical alarm clock, you take a guess what time both of us wake up. Audience: (inaudible). Adano: I didn&rsquo;t wake up till half past 10 and the alarm ain&rsquo;t go off and it&rsquo;s set and it don&rsquo;t go off and I wake up and look at this thing, &ldquo;what kind of ridiculous thing, alarm don&rsquo;t go off, and it&rsquo;s a brand new thing. We&rsquo;re late already, shucks we&rsquo;re never gonna get in this thing.&rdquo; Anyway we got in the car and we&rsquo;re trying to drive to go to the chapel. From the time we got out of the garage and we had to go at least 5 miles, you won&rsquo;t believe it, I haven&rsquo;t missed a red light from the time I left the garage where the house is, to the time I got to the chapel, not a single red light I couldn&rsquo;t miss, everyone, I had to stop by every single red light. I look at this thing and I says to my buddy I says, &ldquo;I gotta hunch he don&rsquo;t want me to come today.&rdquo; Wednesday I&rsquo;m thinking of him and here the alarm clock don&rsquo;t goes off, I&rsquo;m getting these signs already but refusing to accept. Arrive exactly a few minutes to 11 and there is a woman walking right in front of us going in with her daughter and we&rsquo;re behind coming in and we&rsquo;re going up the upstairs you know, the door is still open to let people go in. So I&rsquo;m right behind the woman and her daughter and as soon as I get to the door, the usher says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that&rsquo;s the last people that could be admitted,&rdquo; she put the chain across, &ldquo;but you can listen to the sermon downstairs.&rdquo; Just to show you up to the last minute, he&rsquo;s blocking this situation. Ok go downstairs, sit down, I ain&rsquo;t gonna argue and the sermon started and the part where he&rsquo;s supposed to come out to talk, right over the loudspeaker came this message, &ldquo;Friends and brother disciples, we usually have Dr. Lewis every Easter Sunday to lecture to us, but we are sorry to inform you that last Wednesday at 3 o&rsquo;clock Dr. Lewis went into his spiritual Samadhi or conscious death, he&rsquo;s no longer with us.&rdquo; Audience: Oh, that&rsquo;s when you first heard of him. Adano: Everything clicked at that moment, I said &ldquo;Ok I&rsquo;m satisfied now&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m ready to get up, I don&rsquo;t want to listen to no more to this, I wanted to come out now and go and all of a sudden something dawned on me, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go, must see his wife, must find out how he passed away.&rdquo; So I waited all through the ceremony till the meeting was over about a quarter to 12 then I came out the hallway and I&rsquo;m going down the stairway to the restaurant upstairs and I&rsquo;m looking for his wife and I knew she would be over in the other building. So I&rsquo;m heading to the other building and something&hellip; here is a pool of water, right in front of me, and I can&rsquo;t jump the pool because it&rsquo;s too big a pool, I&rsquo;d fall in the pool and mess up all my suit. So I decided to turn around through the back of the building to go around and who should I bump into, his wife coming through the back way. So I says, &ldquo;I only want to ask you one question.&rdquo; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want no sympathies because this is not the way to greet anybody, disciple don&rsquo;t think that way because the man is in the Guru&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to find out now how did you husband leave the body?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;it was marvelous.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;he went into the hospital on a Monday and he usually goes for a yearly checkup and this was his yearly checkup period and while on Monday we were talking, then he turns to my daughter and myself and says, &lsquo;Bring all my personal papers tomorrow when you come, I want to finish it up, all my personal writings I want to complete tomorrow. Bring all my files and everything.&rsquo;&rdquo; 1:50 So Tuesday she brought everything and he did all his writing and on Wednesday about 3 o&rsquo;clock, just about half past 2 she says she was sitting down there and he was writing, he wasn&rsquo;t sick because he was just waiting for what you call an annual checkup, and about quarter to 3 he says to her daughter, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you go downstairs and give your mother a chance to&hellip; you can go and have lunch and come back and then the mother can go after.&rdquo; So the daughter didn&rsquo;t say anything, she left went downstairs to eat so when the daughter walked out the door, he said to his wife, this is what the wife is telling me, &ldquo;would you put the blanket over there, I want to sit down in the lotus posture to meditate.&rdquo; So he sits down in the lotus posture to meditate and he&rsquo;s in the lotus posture she said, right out of the wall was a big flash of light and Sri Yukteswar stepped out and said, &ldquo;Are you ready to go Dr. Lewis?&rdquo; And she says she&rsquo;s looking at this thing, here is the Master stepped out from the wall, reaching out and Dr. Lewis reach up his hand in the lotus position and left his body and came out and the two of them were looking back at her sitting there and he started to die and the two of them disappeared through the wall and here is her husband&rsquo;s physical body in the lotus posture and he&rsquo;s left the body, he&rsquo;s not coming back into the body, he&rsquo;s gone, he left the body in the lotus posture and she was worried now how she was going to lift up this big husky man and put him in the bed, let alone call a nurse and tell her. So she says she goes to lift the husband and he was like a pillow, no weight, nothing, she just lift him like a baby and put him on the bed, stretch his legs out, cover him and then call the nurse. That&rsquo;s how he passed away. Audience: Oh my goodness. Adano: Well the thing was this, when the doctor came up, she said &ldquo;before I even got to the room I was smelling perfume.&rdquo; Audience: That&rsquo;s very enlightening, very helpful. There was one thing that was really sticking in my mind for the last 4-5 years, two symbols come out of the expressions I experienced that I still don&rsquo;t understand. One is what is the meaning of this red ball, red symbol, because I remember in one of these states I kept seeing this red ball expanding and contracting and at another time I was chanting, I was praising God, just before the sunset and as the sun went down&hellip; (gap in tape) &hellip; to deviate from the search for truth. Adano: Well the acid never dropped nobody anyplace because I think the ancients were more crazy&hellip; with much more powerful acids and they never found God that way. You know even Leary tries to equate LSD with the soma drink of the ancients and they say the soma drink grants you cosmic consciousness, but he failed to realize that soma drink of the ancients was not a physical thing. The soma drink that the ancients were referring to was the touch of a Master which allows you to drink from the well of consciousness inside of yourself and he didn&rsquo;t know what it meant so he figured out at these great spiritual gatherings the Master would be dispensing some kind of chemical and all these students were getting cosmic consciousness. Audience: Would you like some more pineapple juice? Audience: You read my thought Margaret (inaudible) &hellip; my adopted son and he didn&rsquo;t get my thoughts&hellip; (inaudible). Adano: &hellip; oh his sister, we got all those manuscripts that he&rsquo;s been doing you know, but the English grammar you know, I murdered the English language&hellip; Audience: I know you do. Adano: &hellip; send them all back you you and let you work out the grammatic actions of it. Audience: I was going to say, after May 15th, cause right now I&rsquo;m&hellip; Adano: Well that&rsquo;s alright because by that time I&rsquo;ll be starting to work on a magazine. Audience: Ok when are you coming to Dallas? Adano: Sometime soon, I don&rsquo;t know exactly, I have to wait on the doctor&rsquo;s decision. Audience: How are you going to do about finding a place. Adano: No we&rsquo;re going to spend a few days at Louis Johnson, she invited us to spent some time there, so I&rsquo;ll spend a little time there and then visit everybody. Audience: I&rsquo;m going to miss Louis, I&rsquo;ve always felt so close to her and now she&rsquo;s moving away. Adano: But this is attachment. Audience: Oh I know it, I have to learn detachment. Adano: But you see out of sight is not out of mind. If you are a real disciple of truth, if you&rsquo;re a disciple of truth, time and space should not interfere with your communication. Audience: Another person that I&rsquo;ve grown so fond of is leaving us, &ldquo;oh well we&rsquo;ll come visit you where you are.&rdquo; Adano: Where are you heading out to? Audience: Depends where I get a job you know, I&rsquo;m trying to finish my schooling sometime this summer. I haven&rsquo;t started looking for a job yet. When I take a conclusive step in my research I know that I&rsquo;ve done most of it and I only have to write it out. I&rsquo;ll check with you also. Audience: You said you were going to California for an interview? Audience: Yes, Pomona is one place. Audience: That&rsquo;s where one of my students is going. Audience (Jack): Pomona is a suburb of LA and the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, these are the only two places where I&rsquo;ve sent my resume and they&rsquo;ve asked for my references so it&rsquo;s quite possible in the next few weeks that they might call me for an interview. Adano: You mean there is no university in this area that can use you? Audience: No, the only place that I think I can fit in is in my own school where I&rsquo;m studying right now. I&rsquo;m not sure that they are so keen on having me. In the Dallas Ft Worth area there is no other school where I can be of any use. I want to teach in a graduate school, not in an undergraduate school, that is my desire. The other place is Austin, they have a good school. (discussion about how many Indian PhD students there are in US schools and that they are paid $350 / month non-taxable. Texas A&amp;M is a good school too but needs an &ldquo;upgrade.&rdquo;) 2:00 Adano: A, U, and the M, see that upgrades it, it will take you to upgrade the A-M, never can tell, Texas A, U, and M. They need somebody of your caliber to upgrade the college. Audience: In fact somebody said they are especially deficient in the area in which I am trying to apply. Audience: You&rsquo;re not getting away without telling us the significance of red. You remember I asked you yesterday what was the significance of red. We&rsquo;re a couple of old time worshippers here. Adano: You never can tell. Well you can see, remember one time you were both Persians and you were mad at them as your great spiritual time. Audience: Come again? Adano: Persians when they followed Zoroaster. The symbol of Zoroastrianism is Ahura Mazda, the sun, the eternal light. They took the sun as the symbol of God and then people believed that these people were a bunch of sun worshippers. Zoroaster saw the internal light in here, but in order to make his followers appreciate it, he said it was just as good looking at this one to make them conscious that if they look at that sun they would want to think of the sun inside yourself. Now our friend Akhenaten did the same thing when he came to Egypt, he made them look at the sun when he first saw the sun inside himself. See Akhenaten taught the same monotheism, most all your great mystics, the very first experience in the mystical life is the central sun in the brain, which is red, then becomes silver, then becomes gold, then becomes blue, and then becomes white, so you actually ascend this. Now when you get past the white light, it&rsquo;s in that white light you see the radiant form of the Masters, the Masters walk in that white light all the time, you don&rsquo;t see it in none of the other levels because they are in the level of immortality, that&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;Hansa,&rdquo; they are the divine form floating on the ocean of the vibrationless consciousness, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called the suns of God. They are not the sun on the level of the sun inside, they are the inner sun itself, they are the presence behind the sun. That&rsquo;s why it is said &ldquo;God chose the greatest form to manifest in human body.&rdquo; See a tree can&rsquo;t manifest God, an animal can&rsquo;t, the angels don&rsquo;t, none of the higher beings that are actually crystallized in consciousness don&rsquo;t, it has to come down in this physical form because this physical form utilizes the five elements: air, earth, water, ether, and fire. Now when you look inside the spiritual eye you see the five pointed star, you know how a five pointed star is made? It&rsquo;s made like this. Now there is ether, there is earth, there is water, there is air, and there is fire and it goes up to ether again, see the five goes back to ether. Audience: Now in which particular order, I gotta know. Adano: It comes from your top to the left, that&rsquo;s earth, it goes to air, it moves across to the water, it comes down to the fire, and it goes back to the ether. It goes like this you see. Now turn it upside down and you have what Jesus saw, a dove in profile descending, &ldquo;this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo; See He saw the same thing inside, but the five pointed star was in the inverted position descending down. Audience: Gosh how many books have I been going through trying to get this straight in my head. Adano: Now in this position it looks like a five pointed star, in this position it&rsquo;s like a dove in profile. See the wing, the beak, and the extended tail. Audience: The head, the wings&hellip; Adano: But it&rsquo;s all white light because that&rsquo;s all you see is pure white light. Now in there they say the brilliance of that light is equivalent&hellip; one hair of the divinity in that light is equivalent to the brilliance of a billion suns. Now the divinity is supposed to have a thousand petals or a thousand hairs, that&rsquo;s why we said a thousand petaled lotus or the throne of God, you ever see a picture of the all these Eastern drawings, you see the radiant light. If you take the brilliance of one hair, an aspect of that conscious flow, the brilliance of that aspect is equivalent to the brilliance of a billion suns. Now in there this light burns but does not diminish, there is no wick, there is no reservoir of oil to feed it but it burns eternally and its brilliance could blind you if you&rsquo;re unprepared for it. 2:10 Yet one mystic says, &ldquo;I shall (inaudible) behold this brilliance and knew that I and the brilliance was one. I AM HE!&rdquo; And he came out shouting all over the place, &ldquo;I am God, the God is in me!&rdquo; He realized the same thing and people thought he was nuts, they even went so far as they took one mystic after he realized this brilliant force in himself, they took him and skinned him alive because they couldn&rsquo;t believe it, it goes to show you man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man. Imagine (inaudible) he took his club and hit you on the head, he wouldn&rsquo;t believe what you&rsquo;re telling him you see, doctors would try all kinds of pincushion needles&hellip; Audience: (inaudible). Adano: Another friend of mine who had this experience again uncontrolled, see that guitar over there, the fellow who owned that guitar has had many such experiences, but he always ends up out of control and one time he had the experience and he saw all the atomic principles and he was writing down like mad for four days and nights he was writing down all this information and a professor friend of his reads the thing and says &ldquo;Man where you got all this information?&rdquo; And he wants to get it and the guy &ldquo;uh oh, he wants to steal my knowledge&rdquo; and he beats up the professor and throws him out of his house and takes all the paper and everything and burns it up and the people saw him beating up the guy and they called the cops. He thought the guy was going to steal all his information you know, because he was a professor of physics, he understood what the man was doing, but the guy was so wrapped up in this particular experience, he didn&rsquo;t know right from wrong, he didn&rsquo;t know who was his friend and who was not his friend. So by the time they could get him calmed down, they had to take him to the hospital. By the time he came out he realized what he had done he took all the papers and threw them into the fire and his professor friend says &ldquo;Man I&rsquo;ll never go near him no more because he doesn&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;s doing something right or wrong under that condition.&rdquo; But the professor was very impressed of what he read of the information that this man had written down, this is exactly like Walter Russell, see Walter Russell used to be an artist and one day this same thing came on in him and for about 72 hours, he locked himself up and wrote 14 volumes on atomic physics, Walter Russell, and there&rsquo;s one book he wrote called &ldquo;Atomic Suicide&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s another one he called &ldquo;360 Cosmic Consciousness / Cosmic Understanding&rdquo; and he lent that book to Lear, the guy who made the LearJet and told him to read only to page 14 and don&rsquo;t go any further. He was a personal friend of Lear, Lear used to go and visit him, and he told Lear only read from page 1 to page 14, don&rsquo;t go any further because you&rsquo;re going to pop your brain. Remember that young man who was here last night, Ray? Ray went to see Walter Russell and Walter Russell only says &ldquo;you can only read page one.&rdquo; (laughter). That shook up Ray so much, you know that book &ldquo;Atomic Suicide&rdquo; Ray has a copy of it too, he says to me he says, &ldquo;After hearing Walter Russell describe and told me I could only read page one, I don&rsquo;t want to go back and see the man.&rdquo; Audience: Is there any way of (inaudible). Audience: Yeah, Pauline&rsquo;s got the address and his wife, I met her when she was in Dallas, this is a friend of mine in Dallas. I don&rsquo;t know if I want to read it or not. Adano: Well the thing is this, when he wrote it at that time well they just changed a few of the names but he had actually cataloged the atomic table so complete. The thing was this when he was writing this thing complete you know, they thought he had gone nuts, he wasn&rsquo;t married at that time, and a professor friend of his came to see him because he knew he was a sculptor and an artist and he started reading all the papers that were scattered all over the floor and it made so much sense to his professor friend that he started putting it all together. Well that Russell years after he had written anything he had kept on writing and one day he gets a phone call and there&rsquo;s a woman on the other end of the phone, he says &ldquo;I am so-and-so and I know of you and I&rsquo;m coming over to get married to you and I&rsquo;m going to take care of all your writings and look after it until you pass on.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t know heads or tails and this woman showed up and this was his wife that he married, he married her right off the bat and why, because this woman had that same inner experience like him, at that particular period that he was having it and this is what she mentioned in one of her books, he called it &ldquo;the pairing of the souls.&rdquo; Sometimes on Earth two souls or twin souls can be born in two different bodies and they&rsquo;ll know exactly the same relationship what is going on at the same time though they may be miles apart from each other. Now she met him and they got married and she remained and she did all of his work, took it all and put it all in paper form, organized it and everything. Well he was such a disconcerted fellow, he wrote everything and threw it on the floor you know, he was an artist, he didn&rsquo;t know anything of organization and she came and they got married and she took all his writing and start editing it and putting it all together and filing it in book form and everything and put the whole thing in organization, fantastic. Sometimes you never know where this Cosmic Consciousness comes in, it&rsquo;s not just restricted to any part of the world, take Walt Whitman, he had Cosmic Consciousness and you take all the writing of the East and you read Walt Whitman and you see that it&rsquo;s exactly the same thing he&rsquo;s talking about. Audience: I was reading that one particularly (inaudible) and I was so thrilled that you can grow up with something and not be from an intellectual part of you. Adano: Yes, this is true, well you see that there&rsquo;s something that a good many of us miss the boat on, there&rsquo;s a big difference between Self-realization and God-realization. Now don&rsquo;t confuse Self-realization as God-realization, it&rsquo;s a preparatory steps to God-realization, that doesn&rsquo;t say that the man without Self-realization is any less than the man with God-realization. There&rsquo;s just a fine hairline between Self-realization and God-realization and the hair line is this, in God-realization the Guru automatically takes you out of your body at initiation, in Self-realization the Guru allows you to reach a certain level before (inaudible), that&rsquo;s the fine hairline between the two. In other words you got to merit it so when you start out on the road it&rsquo;s like PhD and an ME, you&rsquo;re a Master of Arts you&rsquo;re a Self-realized person and the PhD is the God-realized, just a little something more that&rsquo;s all. In other words, a Master automatically at initiation pulls you out, you don&rsquo;t have to struggle, but when you come to Him you&rsquo;ve already gone through certain understandings about yourself in Realization, that why He grants the initiation in strange ways to the strangest person. 2:20 People don&rsquo;t know who is Self-realized and who is not Self-realized, see what I mean, only a Master can tell that from a past incarnation that a person has gone through all these different trials and tribulations of pain and suffering and psychological understanding to warrant God-realization while others who have to go through it slowly and get that understanding then they&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t say Self-realization is not the goal, Self-realization is the major part of the work towards God-realization, it&rsquo;s just a fine hairline that&rsquo;s going through. In other words look at it this way, Yogananda came and taught Self-realization and did his work until 1935, then his Guru summons him from India by manifesting himself (inaudible) and he went back and then he gave him a new title. He has done enough Self-realization to warrant God-realization, it didn&rsquo;t take too long after that Yogananda went into nirvikalpa samadhi and this is full God-realization and he retained it while in the waking state. Audience: What time (inaudible) nirvikalpa samadhi was it on his return from India? Adano: On his return from India, not before, he could go into savikalpa samadhi on his own and before by his Guru you see, the Guru gave it to him first and then he&rsquo;d go into that state of cosmic consciousness. Now that is what I&rsquo;m trying to point out, 360 degree vision but not 360 comprehension, you see what I mean? Now you can go into this state and have 360 degree vision but that doesn&rsquo;t say you have this total comprehension which is God-realization. When you enter total God-realization, you don&rsquo;t stay too long in the body anyhow and he didn&rsquo;t stay too long after 1948, see he went into &lsquo;48 and passed out &lsquo;52. Audience: In 1948 he went into nirvikalpa samadhi, that was quite sometime after he returned from India. What are the features of the man who is in nirvikalpa samadhi? Adano: Well that painting was taken exactly when he came out of nirvikalpa samadhi, as soon as he came out there was a girl close by and saw his coming out of it and she photographed him in it and he warned her not to use that picture until he passed out of the body and I didn&rsquo;t get a print of that picture until when I met a disciple of his who was a sister disciple of the girl who took the picture and she had the picture when it was taken and the little photograph was given to me and that was about 1955 and it was in 1960 when they printed the first picture of that in the magazine years after he passed out of the body and when they mentioned that this was the highest state of nirvikalpa samadhi as seen when the Master came out of it and that small picture, my friend Sonny enlarged it and then he made a painting. Audience: And this is that painting, the author of this is painting is Sonny. Adano: But that&rsquo;s a photography, he took a small photograph and made it large and then he converted it into oil. Audience: What was the duration of his highest samadhi. Adano: He never came out of it, in the nirvikalpi state, he was always in the nirvikalpi state. Audience: From 1948? Adano: Yeah, this is the thing, when he got into that state and came out, it would have been very pronounced and he asked God to allow him to walk about and appear normal in it and he appeared normal in it from then on. (Somebody brings in the photo). Audience: How can we get a copy like this, please. Adano: Good, we&rsquo;ll try to see if we can do it. That&rsquo;s him in it, he asked God when he came out of it, the total 360 degree comprehension that he would remain in this state in a natural way that nobody would notice it, that he&rsquo;s any different from anybody and from that time he remained in that state naturally until he passed out of the body. Audience: He looks as though he realizes everything. Audience: This is the photograph? Audience: Do you have the negatives? Adano: The negatives, I don&rsquo;t know if Sonny had the negatives, we&rsquo;re going to have to photograph it again. Audience: Would you trust me to have it photographed? Adano: Yeah I&rsquo;ll trust you, sure. Audience: (inaudible discussion). Adano: Well you see this is the thing that the girl noticed, she saw the Master, he was in meditation and she didn&rsquo;t know what was happening and she was a secretary at the time and he just came out of it and she noticed his eyes and she got her camera and she photographed it and he stopped her and he said, &ldquo;never use that picture until I pass out of my body.&rdquo; And then he went back in and asked God that this thing would not show abnormal to nobody, that he would remain normal in it, he would have this total consciousness / comprehension but it would appear normal in his body and then he went about and everybody saw him didn&rsquo;t know he was in that state, but at death his last lecture you see that picture was taken before he passed out of the body, this is when he brought it out again because he left the body in that state. Audience: Yeah that little smile, just a barely a Mona Lisa smile. Adano: Right. Audience: You know Jim wouldn&rsquo;t accept initiation from (inaudible), well why have I not seen him, I&rsquo;ve seen everybody else? Adano: You&rsquo;ll see him. Audience: Well why do I feel so drawn to him? Adano: &ldquo;Those who God loves He doeth testeth.&rdquo; Audience: (inaudible). Adano: That&rsquo;s not painted, that is strictly a technique that Sonny developed. Audience: (inaudible). Adano: No, nothing has been done to this picture, nothing has been done, what Sonny did to this, I&rsquo;ll tell you what he did to this, he photographed that painting then brought the darkness out by photography from the original print. Audience: I think (inaudible) has to do with the SRF. Adano: Well the student, the girl has it, she still lives at SRF. I like this one because it&rsquo;s better than the one that I&rsquo;ve seen that the pictures&hellip; see the one that she had is blurred. Audience: (inaudible). Adano: Well are you going to take? Audience: I&rsquo;ll take good care of it, I&rsquo;ll let Carl hold it all the way back to Dallas. Adano: Well those eyes, I&rsquo;ll tell you those eyes just&hellip; 2:30 You know Kriyananda was telling me, he says he lived with Master&hellip; we became disciples of the Master about the same period, 1948, but he knew the Master about two or three months ahead of me and he lived there since 1948 until Master passed away in &lsquo;52. He said he never saw the Master look the same twice, every day He looked different and every half hour He looked different and he says he could go out of the room and come back and the Master looked different, he says he never saw the Master look the same, no matter what, and he lived with Him because he was His chief male disciple hanging around and doing all His paperwork and everything and he says he lived with the Master so close and intimate that he has never seen the man look the same way twice. Audience: I was in deep meditation last night therefore there are moments when I don&rsquo;t get everything, but the essence of the tale about the (inaudible)&hellip; Adano: And the other lady was accepted (inaudible). Audience: And the essence was that this young man had been a disciple of Yogananda&rsquo;s? Adano: Yes, he was a disciple of Yogananda&rsquo;s, he was accepted when he got the experience in the house and he didn&rsquo;t need to go and get a double acceptance, the Master gave him the experience so the Master don&rsquo;t have to go through a formality of touching him on the head to initiate him a second time or a third time. Audience: What was the essence that Ray was trying to say? Adano: Ray was trying to say that the fellow didn&rsquo;t realize that he got what he was looking for when it happened to him so he was still looking for the formal thing. Whereas the woman who never knew anything was getting it in a formal way. Audience: She needed it. Adano: She needed a formal touch on her forehead from the Master to get this inner experience whereas this boy all his life he was experiencing it and he wrote the Master that he felt he wasn&rsquo;t worthy for the initiation, he didn&rsquo;t live up to requirements, the Master granted him the thing and then he turns around and tells Ray (inaudible) so he can get initiated. So Ray says it&rsquo;s kinda ridiculous when he&rsquo;s got all the thing he that was supposed to get, he didn&rsquo;t realize he was getting it. Well you see I put it this way, (inaudible) was ready for this type of an initiation which would not involved with the human touch and that the Master could intercede beyond time and space and grant him the experience from inside whereas this woman and her daughter who had never heard anything of mysticism or yoga or anything, just the fact that Ray came to visit them and Ray was traveling all the way from&hellip; to go to see this man and they couldn&rsquo;t figure out why was a young man of his age and his mentality leave all that way to travel all across the country just to go see this one man who came from India, but this was a curiosity between her and her daughter. So they wanted to go and see this man, so when he told them when they went to the meeting and the Master shook all of their hands together, He impressed His consciousness on them and she came out and all of sudden she says to herself, &ldquo;I want initiation&rdquo; and she never knew the word initiation, the Master hadn&rsquo;t even used the word in the lecture. There was nobody there that would get up and say they wanted initiation, He just lectured on the spiritual life and here He shook their hand and she walks out and then she turns to Ray and says, &ldquo;I want to be initiated, I want to be initiated, I want to be initiated.&rdquo; Like you say (inaudible), this energy is coming here from inside, first he went back and made an arrangement for her to be initiated. Audience: Bob Ray, another thing he brought out talking about before was than Benny, having lived with Yogananda had drifted away from that life into one packed with utter materiality in the world of phenomena. I don&rsquo;t know if you know Van Tassel and he was involved with that scene, but because of work he had done, he had earned this and the Master granted it to him, but he had let his consciousness fall and not been maintained so it didn&rsquo;t look (inaudible). Adano: You see you know who you believe personally, well Al told me the thing this is what happened. See Al is a very good friend of mine, he&rsquo;s the one that did the organ on the tape. Well Al heard of flying saucers at the time when he was an announcer and you know these announcers are always (inaudible) of news so he heard they were going to have a meeting at this place called Giant Rock, so he went up there just out of curiosity to see what&rsquo;s going on and he bumps into this young man who is married to Boonie&rsquo;s daughter and Boonie is supposed to be the big UFO inter-relayer between the UFOs&rsquo; and the people on the Earth. He met Boonie and Boonie starts talking to him and then he starts to hear Van Tassel speaking about these things, he realized that Van Tassel didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about and he was getting all his information by talking to Boonie. So he latched on to find out where Boonie had got his knowledge from, so Boonie says to him, he was a student of a man called Paramahansa Yogananda and that he lived all his life growing up and he used to have these inner experiences and it was Boonie who first saw the UFO and it was Boonie who went to Yogananda and told him that UFOs existed out in Giant Rock and Yogananda says &ldquo;Yeah, the do, but what concern is that to you?&rdquo; Well Boonie says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to pursue it.&rdquo; The Master says, &ldquo;Alright&rdquo; and he took out the telescope and he says &ldquo;Here, enjoy yourself.&rdquo; That was before Boonie left SRF, see and the Master handed him his telescope that he had in the little place in 29 Palms so Master says &ldquo;Ok, go over there under that tree, enjoy yourself.&rdquo; So he says Boonie told him he didn&rsquo;t know that Master was more hip on UFOs than anybody else, here he&rsquo;s gonna tell the Master about UFOs and he took out the telescope and started looking in the skies, he start to see these things and he came back to the Master sheepishly, so the Master says, &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t want to stay, you want pursue it. Ok go out to Giant Rock.&rdquo; Just like that, Master never held him back in the SRF, he gave him back the telescope, he says &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; For a while he was in doubt, should he remain or should he go to Giant Rock, so he told Al he decided to go to Giant Rock and there is where he met Van Tassel&rsquo;s daughter. Well he said one night while they were on the rock, he saw this light and this object and then he saw this man coming and this man was asking for a pair of wrenches, but this man wasn&rsquo;t talking to him, this man was telepathically talking to him and he realized it was not an ordinary man and the machine was not an ordinary repair because this was an abandoned airfield at Giant Rock and Van Tassel had bought it because he was a wartime pilot and he had a plane of his own. So he was the person who had the actual experience at Giant Rock of the flying saucer people and then told his father and mother stories, well what happened? His father-in-law believed this way, in order to be positive you must be negative, in order to be a vegetarian you must cook yourself enough meat. 2:40 Well Boonie, you know he&rsquo;s married to the man&rsquo;s daughter and he starts straying away from all the spiritual teachings that the Master gave him and I can see why, here is a young man who lived without any social contact and had all this tremendous awareness in him and he had no way to express it and here the Master doesn&rsquo;t hold him back and tell him &ldquo;ok you can go&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s free to go and here he runs into a nice young lady and family and the things that he was interested to get the experience and he finds himself trapped. Well he&rsquo;s working around in the area and he&rsquo;s working around in 29 Palms and you know that little lumber yard when you come down the side street in 29 Palms, you know he drove around the back belongs to a guy named Josh, well Josh lent him a few books on Charan Singh&rsquo;s writings and it was Josh who got him interested in reading Charan Singh&rsquo;s writings. After he read it, he start corresponding to Charan Singh because Yogananda passed away, he had nobody to turn to and he couldn&rsquo;t turn to those at SRF because they weren&rsquo;t interested. So he wrote Charan Singh and kept writing and then according to what he studied, you&rsquo;re supposed to go back to the vegetarian life and start practicing meditation for two and a half hours each day to get back in tune. After the fourth letter he says, &ldquo;I know I can&rsquo;t do all these things and I ain&rsquo;t ready for initiation, but I love you&rdquo; and he signed it &ldquo;Boonie.&rdquo; The next few days this thing happens to him, all this light comes flashing down and that&rsquo;s the time Babarei came in contact with him, just about that period and he starts naming the various levels of cosmic consciousness that he&rsquo;s going in, the various spiritual levels, Babarei don&rsquo;t know these names because Babarei never encountered and here&rsquo;s a guy calling them out one at a time as he&rsquo;s going through them. Some that Babarei were familiar with others he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with because they (inaudible) pulled right up to this thing and so turns around after he&rsquo;s having the experience and tells Babarei if ever this man comes to this country, be sure and let him know so he can go get initiated. Babarei looks at him, he wants to be initiated, here he&rsquo;s been initiated by the man himself and didn&rsquo;t even get half the experience, here&rsquo;s this guy hasn&rsquo;t been nowhere just writes the Master and says &ldquo;I love you and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m worthy to be initiated&rdquo; and here he&rsquo;s getting the experiences. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, from Self-realization you&rsquo;re going to God-realization. Here this man was in Self-realization, he reached a level where he couldn&rsquo;t go any further and he got sidetracked and then the moment he got back on the track, he was pushed into the thing, but I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing now because the last time Al told me, he says after he found out there was nothing to the UFO, Al says he never bothered with them no more, but what Boonie did for him at that time, Boonie didn&rsquo;t know anything of Charan Singh&rsquo;s writings and Boonie said to him, &ldquo;If you are interested in knowing about yourself Al, get yourself a book called the Autobiography of a Yogi&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s how Al got into SRF, but it was funny, Al used to drive with his father down to the veterans&rsquo; hospital from Malibu canyon and they come by way of Sunset up from Malibu into the town and he says everyday he&rsquo;d look out through the window of his father&rsquo;s car and they would pass this little lake with the three arches and it was called Lake Shrine and used to say to his father, &ldquo;What kind of crazy oriental looking thing over there?&rdquo; And they would just keep passing, he and his mother and he brothers and they would all look at this thing, and he says when he did find out that was the Lake Shrine, the Gandhi Memorial, already was about thirty years of age, he walking inside this place to find out what it&rsquo;s all about. Audience: Are you familiar with the Sri Rama Krishna? Adano: Yes you see Vivekananda came over here 1893 and brought the Rama Krishna order and then they established Vedanta in New York, but most of Rama Krishna&rsquo;s writing by Vivikenanda are in French and German and Spanish, they&rsquo;re not all in English, it&rsquo;s amazing. Audience: Now they have the complete works of Vivikenanda in English. Adano: But before the originals are all in French, German, and Spanish. (gap in tape) &hellip; free from the desire to pull you down, you have no actual desire now, you have only one desire and that is to give, your nature is giving, your nature is being, the freedom of being (inaudible) and in this liberation, it&rsquo;s total humility, you achieve humility by exposing yourself to the six basic steps of spirituality without murmuring, without resenting, without harboring any feeling of ill will to anything, you have worked your way through the six steps of spirituality to achieve the total liberation which is the total divinity, the total surrender, the total naturalness. When you meet some people who have this total naturalness, you look at them and you say its pure innocence, pure consciousness, there is no tension, there are no lines of pressure. Now this is a slow process in relation to the physical evolution, the physical evolution goes on faster all the time to extend the five senses more and more, all we&rsquo;re doing with the physical evolution from now until doomsday is to extend the five senses more and more. I said before that the physical world moves faster than the psychological world, one to seven all the time. Now we see it will take an exceptionally long time by the process of natural evolution to improve the awareness of Man. Now within Man, God has placed two principles of freedom. Now none of these two is more important than the other, they&rsquo;re both equal, let&rsquo;s get this one thing straight in our mind, God has placed within Man two principles to achieve this evolution, this expansion of consciousness. When I use one and two I&rsquo;m only referring to numerical order, but I&rsquo;m not referring to it as being one over the other, or one more important and one least important than the other, they&rsquo;re equal, they represent two facets. 2:50 Now these two principles have been setup in us. (inaudible). &ldquo;Meekly wait and murmur not.&rdquo; If you can make this part of your whole life, &ldquo;to murmur not&rdquo; is to not give a hoot. Audience: That&rsquo;s what Jesus meant when He said &ldquo;the meek shall inherit the Earth,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t mean inherit the Earth itself, the wisdom. Adano: The wisdom&hellip; (inaudible).</p>
<h2 id="1969-april---part-2-easter-houston">1969 April - Part 2 Easter Houston</h2>
<p>Adano69_04_2EasterHoustonQ2RRNW6 - He has visited all the temples and extracted the various lingams that were buried by the various Maharishis, but even the people didn&rsquo;t know it was buried there, he brought it out of the Earth. Audience: What did he bring out? Adano: The Shiva Lingams, see he went to various&hellip; Shankara is supposed to have buried five lingams in the various five parts of India and no one knew where they were buried but they knew where the temples were located but they didn&rsquo;t know in what area this thing was actually buried by a Shankara and in the last eight or nine years Sai Baba has visited all five of the temples and raised up the Linga right out of the Earth and put it in inside the temple and this is what made all the pundits realize that he has done more of for (inaudible) dharma than anybody because he has actually located where these lingams were buried by Shankara and not only take it out but did not leave it there. He brought it out of the earth with his spiritual knowledge, he brought it out of the earth, and spiritual power, and he placed it inside the temple&hellip; Audience: For worship. Adano: Yeah and the lingams themselves now are giving off Vibhuthi. Audience: Is that right? Oh I have to read that original part&hellip; I ordered uh six copies of Sai Baba&rsquo;s life because Lewis Johnson gave me the address in India and since I have some money in Indian dollars there, I transferred someone to that bookseller and six copies came for five dollars. Now he wants part one of Sai Baba&rsquo;s life. 0:02 Audience: That is a manifested picture over there. Someone at the Ashram took that photograph and then brought it back to Sai Baba to show it to him and there were a number of other people present so he just took the photograph and (makes clapping sound) there was enough for everyone and that&rsquo;s one of the manifesting. There was only one copy he brought back to show to Sai Baba, well other people around there that were there then said oh they wish they had a copy of that picture see, so Sai Baba just took it in his hands like that and manifested enough prints for everyone and that&rsquo;s one of the manifested prints. See Sai Baba says that anyone can do this, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of holding in the will the pattern of what you want manifested (inaudible). Audience: These are very ordinary powers because we are limited in our way and we think these are great acts because I think in the Bible as well as in the Eastern scriptures these things are present but spiritually they are not supposed to be highlighted. Audience: They&rsquo;re not important spiritually, you know their powers that can be acquired and not used even for spiritual work, it can be used for very selfish things. Audience: Masters always want us to water down this aspect and the Swami also said the same thing he said that &ldquo;Whenever these thoughts and these things come about in religious literature they should be watered down and their importance should not be (inaudible). Adano: As one Yogi says, &ldquo;Sai Baba you&rsquo;re only using Siddhis&rdquo; (inaudible) you keep on practicing your meditation and you&rsquo;ll get there someday.&rdquo; Now they have already shutup that Yogi and many believe that Sai Baba has developed Siddhis to be able to manifest. Audience: The Siddhis I think are all the time there, it&rsquo;s up to you to use them. Adano: He&rsquo;s an incarnation of Shiva (inaudible). Audience: The Siddhis are also I think genuine techniques but they are rather difficult to use it&rsquo;s not a very proper way to go to God. Adano: Quite true. Well he himself even told them, they start challenging him that it&rsquo;s Siddhis and he showed them there&rsquo;s no Siddhi in his work because he is the only avatar mentioned in Vedanta that will come bringing the Vibhuthi and wherever he goes, Vibhuthi is manifested always in his presence and whatever he gives to the devotee, some devotees have pictures of him in their house and three types of Vibhuthi will off from that picture, three types: plain, sweet, and salt. Audience: He is in his body right now? Adano: Yeah, he&rsquo;s about 42 years of age. Audience: I must go next year next year, I&rsquo;m planning on going. Adano: Well the Raymers (sp?) have seen him, that&rsquo;s Indra Devi&rsquo;s teacher now, you&rsquo;ve heard of Indra Devi? Audience: Yes, the Mexican lady who has written a book on (inaudible). Adano: Well she has made him her teacher now, she went there to be initiated by him. Audience: I gave all six to these ladies and I need to take my own copy. Adano: You want a copy back? Audience: No Mrs johnson has reserved one copy for me. I got it for them which came at my address, I took it out of the case and when she got them she said one is for me. Audience: Jack, you may have that volume one which is the one that we don&rsquo;t have. Audience: Do you have volume one or volume two? Adano: No, I got both, one is a paperback and one is a hardcover back, the hardcover back is the one that I got. Audience: Actually I have a money order ready. Adano: I had both. You see when it first came out when the Raymers came back from India, that picture was brought back by the Raymers. You see a fellow wanted a photograph of Sai Baba and the moment he took up the camera to photograph him, Sai Baba stopped him from photographing him and then he did like this (clapping sound) and gave him the picture of himself but then there were six or seven foreign people sitting there and he took the picture back, mentally saying that these people would be jealous. So he did like that and he made a dozen and he gave them all he said &ldquo;This is for you and your friends as you go back&rdquo; and this one is one that I got from the Raymers when they came back. Audience: Oh my goodness, you are so nice Adano that we only have to search for them and they are there. Adano: Right. Audience: It doesn&rsquo;t matter if Yogananda or Vivekenanda have given up their bodies, if you have a yearning in your heart you go and meet Adano: Adano: This is exactly you see because the Raymers have gone and and through the Raymers Indra Devi went, it&rsquo;s through the Raymers that Indra Devi found out about him and Judith Tiber of East West Cultural Institute went there and she was healed. I knew her, she used to belong to Theosophy, she was the woman that grew up, in face she in fact she was supposed to be the daughter of Amy Simpleton or was it that evangelistic woman years ago and Judith Tiber, she got married and and then she got ill with arthritis and she&rsquo;s about in her 60s and she heard of Sai Baba and then she wrote to him and Sai Baba sent her a complete airplane ticket to come to India. 0:10 Audience: Is this what you&rsquo;re talking about? Adano: Yes, that&rsquo;s the first one. And Judith Tiber went and when she met him, he healed her from arthritis and she had chronic arthritis because all her fingers were in knots. Now these Masters are there, it&rsquo;s as I say who you want to contact, they&rsquo;re all there and it&rsquo;s just a matter of who you are drawn to. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: The first person, Ann Jensen, I showed that picture to Ann Jensen and she saw him right in the house when I had the picture. I walked in the house, I had a picture in my pocket you know and I had just come back from California and I came to visit Dallas and I was with Louise Johnson and she wanted me to meet Ann Jensen because Ann Jensen was a psychic you know. So I had the picture my pocket and I walk in and I said to myself &ldquo;Well here I am and I see now who she can see&rdquo; and she look at mes, she says &ldquo;Adano, who is that man in the big bushy hair behind your head? He&rsquo;s walking behind you.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;What man with the big bushy hair?&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;Like the Beatle, he looks like you know Jimmy Hendrix, all dressed up and he&rsquo;s walking behind you and he&rsquo;s smiling.&rdquo; She says &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t look at him because there&rsquo;s so much power and vibration coming out of him.&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know, are you sure it&rsquo;s not Yogananda?&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;No I&rsquo;ve seen Yogananda&rsquo;s picture but I&rsquo;ve never seen this person before.&rdquo; So we sit down talking and she had a little object that she had about the Viking religion and she wanted me to look at it and what vibration I got from it. So I looked at it and I told her it was from the Viking religion and that it represented Thor, the god in the Viking religion, and then when we finished talking I said &ldquo;I have a picture I want to show you, I want to see what vibration you get from it.&rdquo; So I took it out of the envelope and as soon as I hand her, she start crying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the man behind you. This is not a picture, I don&rsquo;t know what it is.&rdquo; 0:13 And I took it out and she looked at it and she says &ldquo;but this is not a picture because the material is not made by a camera&rdquo; and she is a very aware psychic and she holds the thing and she knows this material but this is not a picture and when she saw the picture she says, &ldquo;No wonder you don&rsquo;t see no shadow&rdquo; and you look at that picture it looks very odd the way his foot is rested on that chair, it looks like he&rsquo;s chiseled out of the wood, you notice it? Audience: It&rsquo;s not quite on the floor. Adano: And that&rsquo;s an odd looking chair. &ldquo;Adano is very very receptive to it.&rdquo; The thing is what is more important though is that you know that there is a divine power and the way in is looking inside and not to have this thing come upon you without control, this is what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve so that you can always be in control of it and then from there on you can grow with the thing, this is the whole purpose you see, this is why they say salvation. You don&rsquo;t want this thing to happen to you that you don&rsquo;t have no control because then you begin to do irrational things and before you know it you&rsquo;re the victim of the environment and an environment that don&rsquo;t comprehend is going to make a pretty mess of the thing. Especially your own life will be at stake in the way they act, you have no chance. (Gap in tape). There&rsquo;s a beautiful piece there, one lady is driving in a car with some of his disciples you know so the guy forgot to put gas in the tank and when they&rsquo;re halfway through the journey, he realize that he didn&rsquo;t put no gas so he said to Sai Baba &ldquo;We got no gas in the tank and we&rsquo;ve stopped right here and there&rsquo;s no gas station around.&rdquo; And Sai Baba said, &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; (Inaudible). &ldquo;Ok go down by the canal and fill the drum with water and come back.&rdquo; So the guy goes to the canal, fills the drum with came&hellip; (inaudible). He says when he put the can to his nose to go to pour the thing in the gas tank, he says it was like 100 proof gasoline (inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: If you go back to India, she&rsquo;s in Benares. (Inaudible audience conversation). 0:43 Adano: The ancient Sages have long said that we are not living anything new in this Earth, we are going through cycles, this whole universe is all built on cycles now what we are building today is called space programs we have done this many cycles. Now what we are building today and called it space programs, we have done this many cycles before, this is nothing new, we&rsquo;re only doing it better each cycle and each cycle&hellip; all that we have of recorded history is four ages: the golden age, the silver age, the bronze age, and the iron age. Now what we can only recall in the receding arc of these ages, you can&rsquo;t seem to have any reference as to the ascending arc, what occurred before, there is no recorded history available, it hasn&rsquo;t been dug up yet, as to what occurred before but we only have information as we come down the scale backwards. So at the present level of our archaeological research and understanding, we are just starting off now into a new bronze age, it&rsquo;s just starting, it just came out of the iron age. Now in oriental writings it&rsquo;s called Kali Yuga, Yuga meaning cycle of age and kal or kali meaning dark. In the middle ages where men resorted to killing each other over religious ideas, that was your dark ages and it ended just about roughly 100 some odd years ago but we are now ascending into what is called Dvapara or the Aquarian major according to western astrological writings but we are not in that age yet until the year 2000. We&rsquo;re just in what is called (inaudible) period or the cusp, a little of the dark ages is with us and a little of the new age is with us. Now, but what we are discovering in this present age is the electrical principle of matter, that is nothing new as far as the ancient Sages are concerned, this is something that they knew so well and went backward. Now we are assuming that we are so enlightened that we are going forward but see the thing is that the great Sages have said&hellip; Audience: &hellip; the more you know, the more instead of you progressing toward unity, you&rsquo;re just accelerating (inaudible). Adano: Now the next stage&hellip; all you are going to discover in the next 2,000 years of Dvapara cycle is all the intricacies of the electron. Now when we get into the silver age which we call the (inaudible), we&rsquo;re going to discover all the principles of magnetism but within the next 2,000 years we&rsquo;re going to know a little of magnetism, we don&rsquo;t know much as far as how magnetism really works and what concept we have of magnetism is like a pin drop to what the ancient Sages knew of magnetism you see and they have writings in the Vedas and all the different religious writings of the East based on the laws of magnetism that we can&rsquo;t even begin to decipher yet. Audience: I think if you discovered, if you broke down (inaudible)&hellip; Adano: It&rsquo;s not a figment friend, these brothers have all got off the planet when this planet was going through its convolution. How old is this planet? Four and a half billion years, you mean to tell me Man has only been here 5,000 years according to the Jewish bible, ain&rsquo;t that kind of ridiculous? When an Indian out in the reservation claiming living on a piece of land for 10,000 years and he got stone writing to prove it, it sounds kind of ridiculous. One part of the Earth says &ldquo;Here I am a Man living here over ten thousand years, there is a record from (inaudible), another guy jumps out and says &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve been living on my pieces of land for only five thousand years.&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Many of our astrophysicists are going out on the reservation and they can&rsquo;t figure it out. (Inaudible). We&rsquo;re finding out that we are on the back end of the last golden age going down, we&rsquo;re not on the ascending end. See on the ascending end, Man was living closer to the totality of life by consciousness, today he&rsquo;s trying to produce the totality of life by mechanical means, he is not able to see the totality of consciousness by his intuitive awareness. Now I think he&rsquo;s starting to ascend the scale again, we will begin to experience it. Audience: (Inaudible) back in the day of Moses when he was on the mountain because they made a golden idol and began to worship him. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on now, everybody&rsquo;s working in science and working (inaudible)&hellip; 0:50 Adano: Well you see Master Yogananda and Sri Yusteswar, Sri Yusteswar wrote a book called &ldquo;The Holy Science&rdquo; and in this book he gives the total structure of creation from the very consciousness right down to the atom but this is not a one-way street, this is a two-way street, how to get back there, not just to drop down and be a drop out down here and get held up in this physical frame, it is how to creep back up. Well all the signs that are happening were happening before, it was not the act of a dictatorial God doing it, they are happening because these are the various levels of evolution and cycles that the planets are passing through. Now this solar system that we have, this earth, moon, stars, and the sun and the planet Neptune and Mercury and all this, this particular solar system revolves around a grand center, that is it uses another star in the galaxy as a central focal point to revolve around. Now a planet does not become a star until it will reach a complete seven billion years then it starts decomposing either by one of two reasons: the inhabitants get so good that they don&rsquo;t need it no more or they get so evil that they don&rsquo;t know what to do with it among themselves and then that planet breaks up. Now it is going to break up first by the entire good through cosmic consciousness, there is no need for them to stay there no more because they&rsquo;ve all left the planet, they&rsquo;ve all returned back into their higher self so the planet becomes barren and starts to decompose. Now if it is decomposing by negative thought then it starts to burn, the decomposition triggers it off and it becomes now into a star. There&rsquo;s a simple verse in the Autobiography (gap in tape) &hellip; you start realizing yourself more and more because if you realize that you are the atom returning back to divinity and in the process of this journey you are unleashing higher and higher forces of energy and consciousness and creation is a composite of consciousness and energy, you begin to realize that you are automatically triggering off reactions in the environment. Now if your consciousness is negative, you&rsquo;re going to have negative repercussions, if your consciousness is positive you&rsquo;re going to have positive repercussions. All right, let&rsquo;s say this may be far-fetched, let&rsquo;s take an immediate thing that has just been discovered or accepted, the Sages have said or Yogis have said that they can control their bodies with their minds, doctors are jumping now, &ldquo;It is possible that these Yogis weren&rsquo;t so stupid after all.&rdquo; You are shifting the falsehood they can do many things with their bodies, all right let&rsquo;s see that&rsquo;s only now be reaffirmed in this so-called enlightened age. Well let&rsquo;s take it one step further, that individual that is doing this particular illustration if he&rsquo;s not a fully realized Master or one who is totally merged in this 360 degree consciousness can do that, just shift any little part of his body and create a reaction. Let&rsquo;s say he has total consciousness, 360 degrees awareness, 360 degrees comprehension and vision, what would be the magnitude of his consciousness and matter? Maybe like Jesus, &ldquo;Be thou still and don&rsquo;t move&rdquo; and the waves remain parted, you understand? Now people say this sounds kind of ridiculous, it&rsquo;s all figure of speech that Jesus held back the waves, you know they got a bunch of people to say that you know. No he did move it, he did stop the waves, pick your choice, it&rsquo;s easy to believe blindly that he did stop the waves, it&rsquo;s easy to ignore it and deny that he didn&rsquo;t do it or it would be wise to inquire into its scientific validity and see the possibility of it being done and the possibility of being able to do it because in his teachings he shows the possibility of doing it and if he did do it and centuries after another man comes along and says &ldquo;The more you realize yourself, the more you&rsquo;ll have an ability to influence creation.&rdquo; Well that ocean or that river is H2O in a big water hole and the wind was just stirring it up and threatening the lives of a few people so that is a form of creation and the realization that he was consciousness, that he had this ability, he was able to influence it. Now he is not the only Master that can hold back the way from destroying the disciples, throughout the history of the East there are so many writings where they&rsquo;ve had the teachers. In the time of Egypt they had many Egyptian Masters that did the same thing that&rsquo;s why they were amazed at Moses with his tricks, it was just like &ldquo;Come on moses now, you&rsquo;re stealing our tricks, you were trying to copy us&rdquo; you see? They were aware of all these things but in Moses&rsquo; case when he did apply his knowledge over the Egyptian Masters because the Masters of Egypt were not involved in saving any group of people. In his case he had a purpose, a dedication to bring his people out of bondage and therefore he had a greater challenge, he had to have a greater objective to do the thing, he had to have greater purpose of performing those principles so his motive was more idealistic than the Egyptian Masters, the Egyptian Masters had the same motive and could produce the same phenomenon or the same ability but it was not as idealistic in terms of application as Moses was. Now you have the same thing in Martin Luther King, the people in Alabama, the policeman around that their motive is not idealistic so they would not challenge or do anything to start it up yet his motive is idealistic because he&rsquo;s trying to bring his people out of a particular condition and this is where the sacrifice or the involvement becomes greater in itself, what motivates the person to move the thing and this is where the realization comes in. That&rsquo;s why when Jesus says &ldquo;What would benefit you to gain the whole world and lose your Soul&rdquo; is if your motives are strictly for personal, material gain to use these spiritual forces for that, then it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous but if the motive is to uplift mankind then there is a purpose. Now you have a case of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi never used none of these spiritual forces to liberate his people yet when he was shot, you wanted to see a great miracle? The moment he was shot two tears fell from his eyes on a reporter&rsquo;s shoe and burned two holes right through them like as if was acid and that the reporter that was standing up there wrote a book called &ldquo;Lead Kindly Light.&rdquo; Audience: Vincent Sheean, he was a New York reporter who was within two yards of the assassination (inaudible). Adano: The man never applied, never had the motive to apply his spiritual force to liberate his people but at that point it goes to show you that God never leaves nothing undone even people may not consider him a Mahatma of the outside world, his people called him the Mahatma, (inaudible) put a cap on his head but his real Mahatma-hood came out at his assassination because it proved that the man was there in that consciousness, that his motive was pure. 1:00 If he wanted to liberate his people by miraculous powers and drive the English people out of India he could have have done it, but he never did resort to it you see. I think the same thing is true in King&rsquo;s death, you only see the beauty of King&rsquo;s life is in his death, you don&rsquo;t see the beauty until that point comes up, that&rsquo;s what you call the sacrifice. You don&rsquo;t see these men&rsquo;s lives truly until you see that moment of sacrifice, the same with Jesus, all these great men come to that point. Well I think this is what the idealism is, it&rsquo;s only in death there is life because the seed must die in order to bring forth fruit. Coming back to what we&rsquo;re saying about the cycles, we&rsquo;re not going to see much knowledge right now in the next two years concerning magnetism as Sri Yukteswar said, we will have some knowledge, not the total knowledge of magnetism and we we see a little of the power of magnetism in Yogananda when he found Kashi, you read that part where he found Kashi and where he was going to be reborn in the Autobiography. You know Kashi was a student of Yogananda and then Kashi died yeah because he ate some poisoned food. Before he died, and Yogananda told him he was gonna die, the kid said to Yogananda would you bring me back to the spiritual path, if I die would you find my Soul and bring it back to the spiritual path, don&rsquo;t let it hang around in space. Well you know that&rsquo;s quite a request to ask a spiritual teacher unless that spiritual teacher is in tune, you can&rsquo;t say yes or no so Yogananda said yes he would do it. Now the boy ate the poisoned food and did die and right there Yogananda realized his obligation. All right but the thing is this, here is not a principle of energy that is involved, here is a principle of magnetism that is involved because the technique he used was a magnetism technique. Out of the teeming billions of Souls in this entire universe that is hovering around waiting for human body to be born into in order to realize God, he&rsquo;s got to locate it like a kind of a radar system, he&rsquo;s got send out magnetic waves to pick up that that Soul frequency and pick it up and attract it, which he did. He applied a technique of magnetism that&rsquo;s gonna take many centuries for people to develop by generating it from the heart, we send this magnetism out through the heart and then the fingers and Man has this ability when he realizes himself in meditation that he can do it, the average man may not be able to do it but the person who can meditate can generate this energy so he did send this magnetic energy out and in the teaming billions of people on this planet and in atmosphere, he picked up the exact location where the Soul of Kashi was and start to attract it until he found where the Soul was going to be born in the human body and when it was born, imagine his dilemma, to walk up and tell the guy that his wife is going to get a baby and his baby it going to be a boy and the boy is going to have a certain description, you know that would kinda scare that guy but the only respect he had for him is because he was just like a priest, he had the robe and then he accepted the man&rsquo;s statement and when the boy was born he gave him back his old name as Kashi and the boy recognized the (inaudible) then he asked him if he would stay with him and teach him, he said no, he sent him to another Master. Now here&rsquo;s an interesting aspect, if he was the Master and he did all this, why would he not retain the youth with him to teach him? Why would he send him to another Master? Audience: I think that boy has to go through his own karma. Adano: Right. Audience: Whatever he has acquired from the previous life he has to live with that for the few years that he is on this Earth and then falls onto the next life to resume the journey. Adano: Yes he has to work out that karma and by going with another Master that karma that would require a different type of discipline that he would need. Audience: In any case when he passed away due to the poisoned food, he probably didn&rsquo;t have a spiritual Guru at that stage, that spiritual Guru according to me would have had the power to save him from the death from poison but since he didn&rsquo;t have, nature took its own course but then Yogananda had the power to pick up his Soul due to the power of magnitude and let him be born in particular circumstance of his life. Adano: Yes this is true because the Master was not his Guru at the time, he was just staying at the ashram and trying to learn so he wasn&rsquo;t initiated or anything so he was not initiated so the Master did not assume the responsibility of carrying him back home but&hellip; Audience: This was the time when the Master himself was a boy? Adano: Well no, he was about 27 years of age. Audience: But was he completely realized Master at that point, did his realization come about through the (inaudible)&hellip; let me complete the sentence if you don&rsquo;t mind, according to me there are two kinds of Masters, one class is that are sent by the divine power to earth to preach Godhood and the religious sentiment and the other kind of Masters are those who take birth in human form of their own accord, they have been merged with God, they&rsquo;re God themselves, and they come here of their own power, of their own free will to do good. It&rsquo;s my impression and I don&rsquo;t know how far you will agree that Paramahansa Yogananda belongs to the first class, he came here by the bidding of God, at God&rsquo;s will, and not after his own and that after he passed this life, this was his last reincarnation, he became God himself and now if he comes it will be on his own free will. Adano: It&rsquo;s mentioned in the book there, in the Autobiography, when Sri Yukteswar had so much compassion for the rest of the world at the Kumba Mela and he was standing next to Babaji and Babaji called him Swami and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Swami, I&rsquo;m just a Yogi.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Who I have bestowed the title of Swami, no one throws it off.&rdquo; So he says, &ldquo;Yeah all right.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I see you have a great concern for the people of the West. I will send you a Soul that you will train for Yoga dissemination in the West.&rdquo; Now the Soul wasn&rsquo;t born because Swamiji at that time he was just in his early 40&rsquo;s, Yukteswar was in his 40s you see and he didn&rsquo;t meet Yogananda until he was in his 50s or 60s. So Yukteswar was already trying to have a consideration for the people of the West so this validates what you&rsquo;re saying that Yogananda comes on the first category. He was commissioned to go by God and so when he was born in the body, the link of Masters, his parents was already linked to the Guru of Sri Yukteswar. Audience: Yes, the path was already made for him. Adano: Yeah because Sri Yukteswar was a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya and Lahiri Mahasaya was a disciple of Babaji and it was through Lahiri Mahasaya that Sri Yukteswar heard of Babaji so that when he went to the Kumbla Mela to meet Babaji and got this title and then got this compassion now he&rsquo;s told that he&rsquo;s gonna send him somebody to train so the the boy is born to a set of parents who are disciples of Sri Yukteswar&rsquo;s Guru so Sri Yukteswar and the boy&rsquo;s parents are brother disciples of the same Guru you see? Now he comes along and lives so close to that Guru and didn&rsquo;t even know the Guru was living right next to him and he had to go all the way to Benaras to find the Guru. Audience: That&rsquo;s right, this is very interesting, very very interesting. 1:10 Adano: (Inaudible) to show why in that category he&rsquo;s sent to attain the God realization in the body and to bring Man back. Now in the next incarnation would be of his own volition. Audience: Yeah this is what my impression was. Adano: That&rsquo;s why he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come again and again and again and take you home to my Father which is in heaven because this coming again and again is not (inaudible) now of any divine command you see because he has achieved that realization as God now to come down into Man. You see Krishna said the same thing too, &ldquo;I will come again and again to restore righteousness when unrighteousness takes over. Audience: You know I&rsquo;m not a great orator as you know, my speech is not clear at all (inaudible) because I was sponsoring him for the state of Texas and he was going to be here for eight days at my invitation. I was feeling very gently about how to introduce him to the audience and you know in the audience there are very very (inaudible) people and it is quite possible that you could be in the audience if you are well and it would be so embarassing for me to speak if people like you are sitting. Adano: No, no. Audience: So what I did is that I wrote up three pages and typed it double space (inaudible) and I said that those of you in the audience who are familiar with the Hindu scriptures the Bhagavad-Gita know what the Lord says, Krishna does that on the battlefield then I quoted that, &ldquo;Whenever righteousness is in danger I manifest myself in human form and take care of the situation&rdquo; and then I said that in India of 19th century, mid-19th century (inaudible). So this thing that whenever the righteousness is in danger and decays, I will manifest myself again I took out from&hellip; Adano: Sure but that is true. Audience: Yeah I wanted to introduce Ramakrishna as an Avatar (inaudible). But every time you know I came on the stage, I introduced him about five or six times, I was feeling very very (inaudible). Adano: But the thing is that you&rsquo;re saying if any of the facts (inaudible). Audience: But there was tremendous response Adano, I didn&rsquo;t expect to meet so many people and get that much contact (inaudible). Adano: You see the thing is this, more and more people are trying to inquire into this knowledge, the Masters have said this is the new India because we are on the ascending scale now of the cycles and India in India is going through its own internal baptism and the Masters are coming out to cleanse out what has gone, the period of (inaudible) that they have come out of people so they have their own internal Karma to work out but many of the advanced Souls were being born in the West that were once Hindus who had lived this path of life before with the Gurus, they are given an opportunity to understand the difference between the spiritual and the physical for the first time. You see many of the devotees in the East have neglected the material only for (inaudible), it is not that they did not know of material life in Dvapara and Treta and Satya, they knew of all that in fact they were the wealthiest nation at one time. So it&rsquo;s because of Kali Yuga the poverty and the disease and the decay came in so the only escape that they had was to crystallize themselves in spiritualism, not in spiritual sadhana so they are going through a revival now but those Souls that are born in those cycles that have reached out with the understanding, they&rsquo;ve been born in this new realm because to have an opportunity to spread it, that&rsquo;s why you see they say this is the new India, that&rsquo;s why the Masters are leaving India now to come to this part of the world (gap in tape)&hellip; because you know the limitations of all these things and you yourself can cut yourself from them but I need to say, you can&rsquo;t renounce what you never experienced and life is all experience. How many umpteen lives we need to discover the many experiences so we are given an opportunity in this new era to return to that true Sadhana and that inner Dharma and that is why the Masters have sent him to the West to spread the teachings, to make us conscious how to realize ourselves and at the same time how to finally go into God realization. So the Master knew you see, that his work would be brought to bring the people in this part up to a certain level, but he knew when he left the were other Masters that would be coming who will take them on to the next level and all depending on what level you want to go you see. So there was no such thing as he was the last Master, most people got the wrong impression that he&rsquo;s was the last Master. Audience: (Inaudible). You know the other day we went out to see this movie Ben Hur and it was a long movie, four hour movie, so we had a babysitter to come here and Raj suggested to the babysitter that instead of watching TV and wasting your time and eyes, why don&rsquo;t you read the Autobiography of a Yogi so he started reading it. When we came back he was still reading it you know so involved he said, &ldquo;Can I take it home and finish it and complete it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes please do&rdquo; and then I said if you feel at some time that you cannot read the whole book, please read these chapters, these are very important. 1:20 You know it&rsquo;s a matter of time in 1964 I believe I went to the Chicago public library and there I saw this book (long inaudible section of audience talking)&hellip; You see when the Maharaji was here, Charan Singh was here in the States, one fellow walked up to him and asked him, &ldquo;Maharaji, is there any truth to these UFOs?&rdquo; And the Maharaji looked at him and says, &ldquo;They are coming here and you are going there, nothing to worry about.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t make no bones about it, he says &ldquo;They are coming here and you are going there.&rdquo; There is nothing to worry about it because it seems that this is a natural thing. Audience: Well in the Autobiography of a Yogi (inaudible). Adano: See Yogananda wrote a book, not published, there are several books that are not published, life on the planet, interplanetary travel, and I saw those manuscripts all in that house, you know they&rsquo;re all in longhand, a big file of manuscripts, scriptural interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita which is &ldquo;God Talks to Arjuna&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the name of the title, then the scriptural interpretation of the Christian Bible, the Muhammadan Bible, the Rubiat of Omar Khayam, there&rsquo;s a whole pile of books but they&rsquo;re not published yet because the reason they are not published in his will they were not supposed to be published until certain physical manifestations took place on this Earth and space, by that time Man would be ready to understand the writings. Audience: I think those are books which are not published there are certain revelations which he does not want people to know right now. Adano: Well I know from what I&rsquo;ve read on the Bhagavad Gita, his writings on the Bhagavad Gita has not yet to find any translation or interpretation on the Bhagavad Gita as scientific (inaudible). The way he starts out alone, you don&rsquo;t have to be religious if you&rsquo;re scientific-minded you don&rsquo;t want to put the book down because he goes right away to the science of the thing and there&rsquo;s a part there where it is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, the astral forces of Man are locked up in the hair. Now you remember Samson was not supposed to cut his hair and he defeated his enemies with a jawbone of an ass right. Now how big would Samson have to be that he can destroy so many people the jawbone of an ass without getting tired. Now this man Samson had to live a certain way and it&rsquo;s in the Bhagavad Gita, only in the Bhagavad Gita you&rsquo;re gonna to understand Samson, why Samson was like that because it goes into the scientific thing that Samson was an Essene and the Essenes were the Yogis of the Hebrew religion, they were the ones who were practicing the fasting and doing all the religious rites, vegetarian and devoting themselves to intensive meditation, and he reached that high state of Samadhi where the hair was converting into energy like Sai Baba. Now Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair they can&rsquo;t cut it you know, a man offered to go cut Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair and he says &ldquo;Baba, you need a haircut.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;All right, give me the haircut.&rdquo; So the fella goes and take his scissors and he cuts the hair and the scissors fall apart. Three times he tried to cut the man&rsquo;s hair, after the third scissors broke up, he said he gave up trying to cut Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair so Sai Baba says &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m stuck with my hair.&rdquo; Last year some skeptic was in the crowd and Sai Baba book at him and says, &ldquo;You think you can cut my hair? Ok, here&rsquo;s scissors.&rdquo; So he got up and go and try to cut Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair, he went like that and the scissors broke. After he gave up he realized that this is not an ordinary person. In Samson&rsquo;s case because he kept this secret to himself and did not release it by word of mouth from no one, the actual (inaudible) or the actual Siddhic force was still locked in him so the astral power was still locked up in the hair and he drew the astral energy into his body by the hair. So when he was attacked by his enemies, he could never get tired, there was no way for his physical body to become tired because his hair was drawing photosynthetically the energy right away it was drawing this cosmic energy into his body so he had a strength of nine or ten men. For every man that rushed him, he had this power coming into him. Well one day Yogananda and Yogananda&rsquo;s only five feet four you know, he&rsquo;s not a tall man, and he was sitting in a park and a guy came up to him and said &ldquo;Give me your money.&rdquo; So he handed him some money and the guy walked away and came back, &ldquo;Give me your money.&rdquo; He handed him some money. So the third time he&rsquo;s coming, &ldquo;Give me your money.&rdquo; So he gave him a dollar, the fourth time he came back Yogananda got off the chair and said &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; 1:30 The man was converted on the spot because this man was a big towering, burly guy and he saw this short guy and the force that passed through that short man was enough to bowl him over the ground and knock him upside down with his voice. The power that came through hit the guy over so you can realize that the energy was passing through the Master&rsquo;s hair into his body the same way that the energy was passing through Samson&rsquo;s hair into his body that when Samson was enraged by being attacked by the Philistines, his whole concentrated forces charged up and that his physical body was not really doing anything, this is purely psychic energy, the pure cosmic energy was passing through his body and wielding that the jackass jawbone was just a means of warding off the blow but his consciousness alone could have knocked down those people, he had the inner awareness but until he gave up the secret, until he verbally released the energy and said, &ldquo;Cut the hair,&rdquo; it couldn&rsquo;t be cut so he had to release that thing and then when he released it then the girl cut the hair but then they show you, the hair grew back bringing back the energy but he was blinded but the peculiar thing about Samson was this, when he was being blinded this was a statement, &ldquo;Lord thou are taking away my physical sight that I may see thee better within.&rdquo; Now you go figure that statement out, this man was naturally deeply involved in spiritual mystical studies to appreciate the lack of physical sight to gain inner sight. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well that is the third eye what you&rsquo;re seeing. You see (inaudible) the third eye is not really any thing, your experience of consciousness is the third eye, this is what you&rsquo;re talking about 360 degree vision. It&rsquo;s not a matter of sitting down to develop that vision, it&rsquo;s a matter of being a channel for that vision, there&rsquo;s a big difference. See some people may spend all their lives trying to develop or force this condition of this vision to come on and only get about a few degrees of it but to be a channel for this vision to pour in is a big difference. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You see but that&rsquo;s Prasad, it has the vibration in it, just pass it around. See Prasad is holy food, a spiritual Master blesses the food, we don&rsquo;t bless it (inaudible), they don&rsquo;t pray over food. After you reach a certain degree of realization in yourself you know that you are consciousness and energy and consciousness and energy passes through the body in a vital regular magnetic process. Now in the form of heat, now normally in the normal eyes we may not see the transformation, someday when we get certain machines developed we will see this as a result of transferring this consciousness to matter. Food when it&rsquo;s cooked its rate of vibration is lowered, its electrical content is lowered. Now to pray over it by mere words would not raise the electrical contents back to a frequency in which it has some dynamic action in your mechanism but if you are realizing yourself through certain techniques of meditation, you can transfer this magnetic energy into it and this energy will raise it and in time scientists will write up an article saying that the potentiality of matter can be raised from its normal status, kinetic state, without utilizing any machine the mere fact&hellip; Now this is exactly what Jesus did to the few fishes and the bread, he raised this magnetic ratio to such a point that the thing became self multiplying but this is because how realized the person is, the power is there available to him. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: There was a girl who lived at SRF in California and she&rsquo;s a good Christian girl and she grew up in the Catholic church and she has often wondered about the feeding of the thousands you know, if this is really a possible thing with Jesus or if it&rsquo;s just a trigger of imagination or some kind of allegory. So one day she&rsquo;s staying at Paramahansa Yogananda at the ashram and there were about 36 people came to visit him from out of town, she was in charge of the office at the time so he said to her during the session of conversation would she serve some carrot juice. So she went to the fridge and there was just about this much in the fridge of carrot juice and there wasn&rsquo;t no more carrots and she went downstairs and there were no carrots and they&rsquo;d have to go out and buy a pile of carrots and make carrot juice for 36 people. So she came back and told the Master quietly that there is no carrot juice and the Master looked at her and said, &ldquo;Would you please serve some carrot juice.&rdquo; What would you do? You would take out 36 glasses and try to pour 36. Audience: It would depend if you would believe him or not, some people would think he was crazy or some people would just say &ldquo;well because he said it, there must be some meaning or reason why he said it.&rdquo; So in other words you would trust him. Adano: (Inaudible) &hellip; take this much carrot juice and get the 36 people (inaudible). Would he ask you to serve it? Quite a test, right? She went and got the 36 cups&hellip; (inaudible)&hellip; So she took the 36 cups and start pouring. She filled the 36 cups and still had a whole cup left over and she was trembling with the tray by the time she got out there and served the 36 people including the Master and herself. By the time she got back in, she never wished again in her life to see another miracle and then the Master said not too long after he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not your faith that made it possible, it was only because you had to be freed from it.&rdquo; In other words he didn&rsquo;t do it in order to satisfy her to see the fact that such a miracle did exist or such a principal did exist, it was done strictly to free her from thinking that way, you see? Audience: Well I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth there&rsquo;s many things I believe were definitely impossible that happened until after I went through certain things and I think even today I would I still believe that I was losing my mind. (Gap in tape). Adano: &hellip; understand that the perfume is the love of God permeating us all the time and you will find this in the presence of all the Masters all the Saints, there&rsquo;s a perfume that permeates their presence. 1:40 Audience: You know when I told someone about it, this is why I refrained from ever talking about it, just talking to very very few people because when I told one person about it he said it was your imagination or your development of concentrations as far as the things that you&rsquo;re able to do on your own accord. You know I didn&rsquo;t agree with that, I didn&rsquo;t believe that it was my mind doing these things you know, I knew better but he kept insisting it was my mind you know. Adano: That is the typical Freudian psychological description, Master used to say this, &ldquo;Those who want to get tall cut off the heads of others.&rdquo; Those who want to get tall cut off the heads of others so in order to impress you that your knowledge or your experience was invalid, he wants to make you feel that you were conjuring this thing up in your mind. He didn&rsquo;t want to accept the reality that this thing could come from some other source and that you could have been just a mere channel for the thing. That&rsquo;s like the story of the fox you see, the fox got caught in the trap and no way to get out so he bit off his tail and he looked around and he saw it was a nice thing and he went around and told everybody a tail-less fox is a beautiful thing. While all the rest says, &ldquo;Hey buddy that&rsquo;s yours, not ours,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s your experience. Audience: Well the same thing when I began to understand how Aristotle, his theories on the design and construction of the universe and how Saint Thomas Aquinas used Aristotelian thought to discover God is present in the universe. He said you know nothing can bring it, from nothing comes nothing, he says the design and construction of the universe for meaning, reason, and purpose and while I was thinking of Aristotle I was going back to my room I looked up in the sky and the wind started to move the clouds and formed this figure of Aristotle&rsquo;s head. Adano: You&rsquo;re seeing Rorschach inkblots in the forms of clouds, you ever see Rorschach test? Well this is a summation because you&rsquo;re seeing this thing in the clouds so he jumped to that conclusion as a means to analyze your experience. All is life, you see the thing is life.</p>
<h2 id="1969-april-23---dallas">1969 April 23 - Dallas</h2>
<p>Adano69_04_23DallasQ2RRNW6 - Because that year he was granted a grant to go and do some lectures on brain research and he went to visit Yogananda in 1951, the year before Yogananda passed away and this was what the gist of this visit was because it was recorded at the time. He said to him, &ldquo;Master, with all my mathematical knowledge and my scientific training I know I cannot bridge time and space to solve this electronic problem that I have here now which I want to complete and if I continue it will take me approximately four to five years to complete this by a slow methodical method to get what I want to be able to make these measurements. Could you go into this superconsciousness and solve my mathematical problems and Masters says only because we run away together as penniless boys I&rsquo;ll do it but I&rsquo;m not here to perform miracles and he said the Master closed his eyes for about ten minutes and when he came out Master gave him the exact mathematical formula and he went back to India and it was approximately a year after, his machine was complete and he made his first test on a Yogi in India on the brain and then he setup a clinic just going around measuring the brainwaves of people who go into different levels of Samadhi. The Master passed away in 1952 and when Master passed away in 1952, he wanted to come back, but he couldn&rsquo;t get back in time because he had an invitation to attend the funeral in 1952 and didn&rsquo;t make it and we know at the funeral the body was exposed for about 22 days with rotting and this was in Los Angeles in Time Magazine but Dr. Ghosh had gone ahead and kept on in his own researches right today now checking on these brains and he passed away in 1964 and there&rsquo;s a whole set of records and I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has taken it up from then on but there were two French research scientists from Sorbonne who became interested after and I don&rsquo;t know what they have done with it but they have gone ahead and gone to India Pondicherry India, French India, to do some researches. Now Yukteswar is saying in his book that you can arrive at this state within one lifespan but if it is one lifespan it requires discipline to go into it and this is the whole purpose of meditation. Now I told you in meditation the word is an anagram, it&rsquo;s not what it appears to be and a good many of us go around saying I&rsquo;ll be meditating but we don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re doing and lots of people on the scene saying what meditation is but it takes a Master who has arrived at Sat Lok to really interpret it correctly and scientifically that you can understand what you&rsquo;re talking about. The word is an anagram, it&rsquo;s a composition of many things and we&rsquo;re stuck with it in the English language. M is Mind, not the mere little mind, it&rsquo;s the universal intelligence or consciousness. E is energy and these are the only two things that exist but they&rsquo;re one and the same thing at different speeds. If you slow down energy, you will get matter. If you speed up energy, you&rsquo;re gonna get consciousness. This is the thing that is puzzling scientists, especially (inaudible) we&rsquo;re bordering on a peculiar phenomena in accelerations, we can speed up with corrosion ability of an object pretty fast and collapse it but to a point we know we can stop that corrosion and bring it back but we don&rsquo;t know where to stop it to bring it back, this is what is puzzling us right now in our research. Here&rsquo;s a piece of metal, I can speed up its corrosion and quality right to the point of destruction but I don&rsquo;t know where to stop before she falls apart and slow it right back to where it started off, bring it back so it will appear as normal as before it started off. If we can find this breakthrough, we would have established something in ourselves. Now when it&rsquo;s about to collapse, a particular phenomena occurs there too, you can almost sense it, you can always know it in such a profound way that it&rsquo;s going to give now, how it seems to communicate in a strange way. Well it&rsquo;s only confirming, and it hasn&rsquo;t been confirmed completely yet, what the Sages are talking about, mind and energy. You know I said the word meditation is M-E, Mind-Energy, and those mental energies or mind and energy is not moving in a blind state, it is following a definite pattern all the time, a definite (inaudible) process or pattern, never gonna to go away in a blind thing, seems to follow definite rules, in a strange way Doctor (inaudible) himself admits this in one of the writings, that there seems to be an order in this thing. Now it&rsquo;s Mind and Energy Directing Individual because meditation is an individualistic science, I can&rsquo;t do it for you and you can&rsquo;t do it for me, each one of us has to stand on his own two feet and perform, that implies discipline, and the discipline has to do with coaxing the mind now, directing it. So it&rsquo;s Mind Energy Directing Individual, individual what? T, the next letter, thought, the idea patterns in human consciousness, the various impressions in us. In the oriental language we call it Chitta, the substance of the brain waves that are impressed all the time, these thought impressions, these impressions and their rates of movement, Activities, the &ldquo;A,&rdquo; the various rates of movement, this is what we involved with. It&rsquo;s Mind Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities and it&rsquo;s not moving blindly either, it&rsquo;s moving towards a definite purpose or goal, &ldquo;T,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s Towards, Intuitive, the next &ldquo;I,&rdquo; that is an independent of your five senses. Meditation does not rely on your five senses to know anything, it seems odd and it may seem to border on something ridiculous or supernatural but it&rsquo;s purely natural because you may call it extrasensory perception, that&rsquo;s another name for it but for the mystic who really knows it, what it represents, it means the capacity to know independent of the senses, directly all the time. In other words there is a capsulation of time in knowing, there seems to be speeded up ratio in your knowing, it&rsquo;s so profound that it capsulates time to a split second that you know, regardless of time and space, and this is independent of seeing it or hearing it. Now independent of the senses, Intuition, then &ldquo;O,&rdquo; the next level in meditation, the word meditation, this is dualistic. All the books on meditation that have been written and spoken by men, I&rsquo;ve often said that meditation has a dualistic function. In Buddhism it&rsquo;s mentioned that you meditate with seed or without seed, Zen Buddhism says the same thing, to meditation with seed or without seed but what do they mean by seed or without seed. Scientifically speaking it only means one thing, a seed is something you can see right? You can observe, without seed is something you don&rsquo;t see, you can&rsquo;t observe, so throw away that terminology and go back the word, &ldquo;O&rdquo; and see if the Sages are not specifically identified it. 0:10 &ldquo;O&rdquo; is the ability to observe now independent of the five senses for the first time creation around you as it really is and since it&rsquo;s a dualistic function the letter &ldquo;O&rdquo; goes the next level, At-One-Ment or Oneness, it is where you and the object become one. The scientists cannot become one with his mechanics, I cannot become one with a piece of machinery but I can become one through meditation with that machinery that I can cause it to do certain actions from a distance. This can be demonstrated, it&rsquo;s called telekinesis, you can manipulate the thing but this is becoming one with it and these are very limited instances, we&rsquo;re talking of an actual result At-One-Ment where the consciousness is so accelerated that it does affect matter. Now we see you are capable of observing independent of the senses and you&rsquo;re capable of becoming one with your observation, then the last letter is &ldquo;N,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s called noumenon not phenomena. No Sage or realized man will teach you anything about phenomenon because he doesn&rsquo;t believe in phenomena, he&rsquo;s looking at reality for the first time and in that reality all he sees is conscious light which he has become one with. At that level there is a slight pulsation, he can only stop his consciousness at the vibratory rate, he cannot seem to get past the vibratory rate into the non vibratory rate of creation, when that does happen he and the light, he is light. Now in religion they call that level illumination or enlightenment but the word is so synonymous of the result. You illumined, you&rsquo;re enlightened, you lit up, or you&rsquo;re turned on, whatever term you want to call it but it is at that moment now there is no vibration there but this is a result of meditation, it has nothing to do with phenomena so we&rsquo;re dealing with a very scientific thing in itself, we&rsquo;re dealing with mind and energy, we&rsquo;re dealing with the principle motion pertaining to each individual, and an independence of the senses. So he says &ldquo;Well you know if you can see through the wall you&rsquo;re clairvoyant but the mystic or the spiritual man is not interested in that, that is just another byproduct if you want to call it extrasensory perception, to him that is child&rsquo;s play, he&rsquo;s dealing with something far more profound than that. He&rsquo;s observing for the first time creation as it really is, independent of his five senses, and then he&rsquo;s becoming one with it, identifying with it. Now Master said this when he was in the body, &ldquo;The deeper your realization of your observations of the structure of creation, the greater is your capacity to influence that creation.&rdquo; Now this adds up to making your thoughts materialize at will for the first time. Now a man with such a capacity will have to have a complete moral life because you&rsquo;d make a mess of things if he had the ability to materialize a thought that rose without any moral compunction, without any sense of conscience or anything, you know what would happen? Everything here would go helter skelter. You remember HG Wells wrote a book on that same thing, the man who made miracles or the man who could performed miracles? What did he do? He said to the policeman &ldquo;drop dead&rdquo; because the policeman accosted him and the policeman fell dead so that shook him up. Somebody else accosted him, he says, &ldquo;Oh go to&hellip;&rdquo; some odd place and the here the man is thrown into some odd place, his thoughts you see. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to point out, how this thing out of control. Now here&rsquo;s where you come back to the Masters again, you cannot have this power capacity to use in a helter-skelter way because they themselves block you, in other words this is already a self police system you see. Psychics are allowed to have their psychic kicks and do their little things, no Saints will interfere, but when you start affecting the structure of creation with thought force then the Saint steps in and put you down, take away your forces from you. That&rsquo;s why they call them Masters, they come back on the scene, they can exert this consciousness wherever they are, time and space has nothing to do with it. There is a Master who lives now and his name is Sai Baba. I have a friend who lives in Los Angeles and he wrote to Sai Baba and he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come to visit you because I can&rsquo;t afford it right now and the type of work I do, I have to be an air guard for our country in civil aviation for people who get lost, I have to go out and find them but whatever you can give to me in a way to uplift me that I can meditate and understand the nature of myself, I&rsquo;d accept. Whatever little council you can give me.&rdquo; You know as soon as he mailed the letter, put it in the mailbox and went back home and was sitting down in his room, here is the man sitting in the room with him, the door is unlocked and he&rsquo;s there. Now you say this was hallucination, mental thing, no. What happened? He says &ldquo;Come and reach me, touch my hand, make sure you&rsquo;re not dreaming.&rdquo; His name is Charles, &ldquo;Charles, feel, this is Sai Baba, you&rsquo;re not hallucinating.&rdquo; So Charles for the first time you know what happened? He got diarrhea from the reaction, couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes you know, the shock was too great for the man, never expected something like this because he read very little of the subject but he heard of this man living and wrote to him, the man is still alive and the shock was too great. Then Sai Baba says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo; and he left him. Next day he had to fly out from Civil Aviation service and while he&rsquo;s in the plane over Los Angeles right there in the bay, right in the next seat, Sai Baba appears again to him. He says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an apparition,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;Come on, shake my hand, make sure.&rdquo; All right, there was an apple there on the cockpit and Sai Baba bit into it and left the other piece and Charles will show you that apple up to this day since he has known Sai Baba, that apple is not decaying. This is one in strange phenomena of this thing, that there are a few, I won&rsquo;t say plenty because a thumb, there is only one on the whole hand, there&rsquo;s just one or two individuals like that. So somebody in India says Sai Baba is a magic maker, he&rsquo;s using psychic powers to impress people. He was going to cut Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair because Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair looks like Jimi Hendrix, if you see Sai Baba, Jimi Hendrix is a living example of Sai Baba if you don&rsquo;t know it was Sai Baba, you would think it is Jimi Hendrix. People in India would think that if Jimi Hendrix went for a visit there, Sai Baba walking down the street, big bushy hair and the same color skin. Well this guy was gonna cut Sai Baba&rsquo;s hair, so got up the shears and went to try to cut the hair, he cut first nothing happened, he cut the second time nothing, third time this shears is all crumbling into powder. So Sai Baba looked at him and says, &ldquo;Well skeptic what you want?&rdquo; 0:20 But then you see the thing is this, many people cannot fathom him because they alluded so many things to him as to what he is and what he&rsquo;s not and he only reveals this to a few disciples or a few people what he really is. Sai Baba is an example of Man from the Golden Age Satya Yuga period that&rsquo;s been known for thousands of years that there have been a such man that walked on this Earth and had the ability to materialize their thoughts at will. In your (inaudible) writings or Indian writings, Oriental Chinese writings we know of this, we used to call them the Immortals, the Immortals of the Tao. In Chinese writings, there were approximately nine Immortals, not Lao Tzu, he was not one of them. Lao Tzu didn&rsquo;t write the Tao you know, he just recorded a little of what he learned of the Tao. These nine immortals of Chinese wisdom existed thousands of years before Lao Tzu came on the scene. There were nine of them, they had this ability of materializing thought at will, they lived in the Golden Age period, there were only nine that walked through China and the upper part close to India and Tibet and in India they said there were just about eight or nine that walked through India. Well Sai Baba is a man from that period, we&rsquo;re looking at a man ahead of his time today in this century, when he passes out of the body we will not see another such individual for a long time, it&rsquo;s only to make us aware that such men did exist at one time. Now what Sai Baba has done, you know there was a writer by the name of Shankara? Well Shankara when he was alive a thousand years ago, he buried in the five sections of India, five lingams of Shiva, Shiva lingams, it&rsquo;s like a little monolith, it&rsquo;s supposed to represent the reproductive principle of life, of Shiva, it&rsquo;s a symbol, it&rsquo;s an object about this wide and about this long and about this thick. Now it was buried, these were all buried by Shankara and for centuries the people in India have worshiped at the suppose site of the buried object, not even really knowing where those objects were actually buried, just to get some kind of experience or awakening from them like a sort of a magnetic pull and for centuries they went on and rituals all around the whole place trying to get something that they even built such a big organization around those areas and they would kill you if you defiled their temple, bodily snap you up, and he walked in there one day, they didn&rsquo;t know who he was, the first temple he walked in, didn&rsquo;t know who he was because he usually takes trips by himself, he&rsquo;s a man about 42 years of age, and they say he looks like Jimi Hendrix too, Jimi Hendrix look like him. He walks to the temple and he said to them, &ldquo;Hey you lazy Sahdus, what you doing here? What are you trying to do? God is not here, God is in yourself,&rdquo; aggravating them you know. &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you get down and do something constructive, build a house, build a canal, give people some food.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you young man? You up start you, you desecrate this temple, don&rsquo;t you know this is where the holy lingam has been buried by Shankara&rdquo; and they give him a big spiel. He says &ldquo;Okay show me where it is,&rdquo; put them to the challenge and they didn&rsquo;t know where it was. He says &ldquo;Well you know so much about Shankara, I tell you Shankar Lingam is buried 10 yards from this temple, it&rsquo;s not even inside the temple.&rdquo; So the pundit of the first temple that he went to got angry you know, he took a stick to hit Sai Baba, he walked right over to the spot and chanted the mantram and out of the ground the lingam pushed itself like a worm right out. He says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your lingham&rdquo; and they recognize it because they had drawings of it and he took it from there and he put it inside the temple. For the first time they can see it in this day and age, so many thousands of years been buried in the ground by Shankara and no one has actually seen the lingham, they didn&rsquo;t know what it looked like, they were worshipping something and they didn&rsquo;t know what it was. He says &ldquo;This is what you&rsquo;ve been worshipping.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;That is not God but here it is now for the first time that you can see, it&rsquo;s not gonna be lost from your sight.&rdquo; Well he says to them, &ldquo;The lingam had a quality when Shankara put it in the ground&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;and that quality will come back to it right now.&rdquo; And this is what we call the vibhuti, that is the holy ash like the scent, like powerdered incense when it&rsquo;s burnt, start to flow from it and they collect it and you know (inaudible) how you used to put the thing on your head? They&rsquo;ll take it and touch it on each body&rsquo;s head as a sort of devotion to God, (inaudible) respect that this thing was brought about. Well he went to the second temple and did the same thing and all five temples he went in all five parts of India and brought them out. From that time then they realized that he was not here to perform no miracles or anything, he wasn&rsquo;t here trying to be impressed, he was just restoring their religion for the first time in their lives and a good many Hindus who were living in ashrams, many the Swamis that were living in ashrams you know, he went to them and he chased them out. There was one ashram I remember reading, where he went to this ashram and the Swamis were in there meditating for a long time and their Guru had passed away and he walked up to the guy and says, &ldquo;Why you trying to make yourself blind, come out in the Sun and see the real God. You sit here all your life pining away, God is not in there.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Who are you young man?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a messenger.&rdquo; So he tries to argue and Baba says, &ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;ve been sitting here so long waiting for your Guru to give you illumination, here have it.&rdquo; And he touched him on his head and he died one day after. His whole life was condensed in that one experience for him and people said that was a cruel act of Baba for that man, you know what Baba remarked to those people? It was worse for the man to hunger in ignorance for truth, than to be exposed to truth for one brief moment and pass out of the body, then they realized there was something of value. What&rsquo;s good is it for you to sit down there for the next 20 years still living in ignorance of something, going through the motions, and for 10 minutes you get an exposure to something of real value and you give up the frame because this is what you wanted in the first place, you wanted the freedom. But coming back to what we&rsquo;re talking of meditation, we went so far into some strange things, meditation (inaudible). Meditation is not a new religion, it&rsquo;s nothing new, never will be, it&rsquo;s no invention of anybody&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s strictly a way of which you can look within yourself and observe yourself and do exactly what Jesus asked you to do when He was in the earth body, seek the truth. Now I don&rsquo;t mean philosophic truth, seek to understand the nature of creation and its laws, how they function within you and this truth will make you free, free from the attitudes of thinking that foul you up and produce doubt, fear, anxiety, greed. It will give you a freedom that when you think for the first time you can see something tangible occurring and you can modify your daily life for yourself, this is a truth about thinking, the possibilities of thinking. From this truth make you free, lord of yourself, nobody is pulling you by your nose, no Master is your Master, He&rsquo;s is not somebody like, you know, over a slave. A Master in the Eastern terminology or Rabbi, Rabboni, only means one who has mastered himself, one who has learned the complete science of behavior and applies it to himself. 0:30 Now a Master will tell you that He does not have a Soul, that&rsquo;s why after he finish meditating and achieved the realization that He does not have a Soul, you will come to want and listen to him but before then he might have lived under the illusion that he had a Soul until he woke up to the idea he has no Soul. A Master says now, &ldquo;I am Soul.&rdquo; Now if this is an incorrect statement, we can take all the scriptures that&rsquo;s been handed to Man and you will see that it is stated &ldquo;Man is Soul&rdquo; but let&rsquo;s take your Judeo Christian texts that you are familiar with. &ldquo;God breathed into Man the breath of life and Man became a living donkey,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re a theological student, tell me if it&rsquo;s correct, or Man became a flying object, a UFO, or Man became another two-legged beast, or Man became Man, what he became? Soul, but what is Soul? This is our mental illusion that Soul is God. The moon in a glass of water is the moon? What is that? Audience: Reflection. Adano: Alright but if you have ten glasses of water would you say you have 10 moons in the room? Ten reflection so what is Soul? And God is what? Is He somebody sitting on a throne dispensing miracles? This is the question, what is it? The only way you can know what God is, is to know what God is not, therefore you have to observe independent of your senses for the first time, you have to make that attempt to observe creation as it really is around you, independent of your senses for the first time, not phenomena, noumena, reality, truth. You have to make that first attempt to observe this thing, it requires a great deal of concentration to observe, any scientist will tell you that, any student who wants to make a grade, any artist will tell you that, to concentrate is to relax, withdraw your scattered attention, and direct it to one single purpose with patience and love. This is a tremendous technique in itself, concentration, because you first got to love what you want to concentrate on, you first got to have a tremendous desire for it to exert enough willpower behind it. Now your willpower is in ratio to the amount of energy you&rsquo;re going to put into it so greater the will, greater the energy, the two go together, they&rsquo;re not separated, you can&rsquo;t have one without the other. The energy must flow (inaudible, the energy has to come from the makeup of your mechanism and this is the energy you have to direct to the ID to observe. The same way you take energy and put it through an x-ray machine to make an a picture of the bones inside, it has to be concentrated, there is a force that has to be applied so meditation is not just a lazy man&rsquo;s job, in fact you wish you won&rsquo;t want to have ever encountered it because it is work, it&rsquo;s not no instant magic. I don&rsquo;t promise you&rsquo;re gonna get instant Godness from sitting down like a lump and getting to illumination, it ain&rsquo;t coming that way. It don&rsquo;t come that way, it&rsquo;s work and it&rsquo;s a work in trying to let&rsquo;s go which is the hardest thing for all of us to do, you see this is a very difficult thing to do, mentally to let go. Most of us want to hold on, we don&rsquo;t want to let go and meditation, this is the first requisite of it, learning to let go, you see but this letting go is to observe, not to detract or not to dictate you see. Now you can&rsquo;t do this meditation or this observation, this mental observation 24 hours a day, it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous and is very impractical and unscientific. In order to bring discipline into it, you must have a regular period to do it because everything, even nature works on a regular time schedule. The Sun don&rsquo;t fight with the moon, the moon don&rsquo;t fight with the stars, each one has his own particular period to shine, this is where discipline come in to discipline your consciousness to a period to let go so we start off in the morning before you get off the bed for approximately a minimum of 1 hour, that the minimum required time of learning to let go of yourself, learning to calm yourself and observe yourself for one whole hour. Now this is gonna be a struggle, you know why? Let alone the next hour before you go to bed, the biggest problem in letting go is this: that your mind begins to wander, you can&rsquo;t stop, you don&rsquo;t know how to stop it because it&rsquo;s electrical waves, the brain is a living organisms, it vibrates, these waves keep going, you can measure them over and over and the more you begin to concentrate is the faster this thing becomes wandering, the more it wants to wander, the quicker it wants to wander. In fact it wanders so fast like the speed of light, you can&rsquo;t even keep up with the wandering and you can only wander in three areas you know, three areas of ideas: ideas is concerning the past, ideas concerning the future, ideas concerning the present, there&rsquo;s no other outside of these three you&rsquo;re going to wander. Now when your mind wander to an ID consider the past, if the past is not pleasant for you, by the way you get frustration. If your mind wanders to the future, ideas concerning it since you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the future you have no way to check it out, you&rsquo;re going to develop anxiety. So if you want to stay in the present, Now, which you really exist in, what do we expect from the present? What you think is going to happen you think of the present? Suspension because what can you think of the present, it is already there. Where you are right now, you&rsquo;re thinking of lying on the bed, you&rsquo;re thinking what a crazy fool I am to lie down here, I gotta get up and go wash my face and go to work, suspension, but what is suspension representing? It&rsquo;s representing a state of awareness called tranquility or peace. Now it&rsquo;s this suspension, this letting go, moment to moment, that accumulates within you and alters your whole attitude towards yourself, the first experience in meditation is this. You begin to see it for yourself, nobody has to tell you this because after a few days of it, you begin to recognize a peculiarity about it, you want to get into it. Now you have another problem in it: your mind tells you if you sit down long enough you&rsquo;re going to make the grade and become a highly illumened man so you think you&rsquo;re gonna stay in there for 24 hours and you shut yourself off from society, no such thing would happen. You see that&rsquo;s the wrong conclusion your mind will come to, you can&rsquo;t sit down for 24 hours and do it, stay in there and expect it, what will happen? 0:40 Sooner or later the body is going to atrophy, see nature&rsquo;s very smart she&rsquo;s not allow you to get away with it so easy, you&rsquo;re gonna pay this price, you gotta work for it. Now, but how you keep the mind there, you can&rsquo;t just sit down and wait, yet waiting is exactly what the Quakers will tell you to do, vigil, their meditation was the meditation of constant inner watching. Well let&rsquo;s see if they were continuing to form like Jesus would say, &ldquo;Watch and listen and wait for you never know when the Lord will come like a thief in the night.&rdquo; A thief in the night don&rsquo;t tell you when he&rsquo;s coming to rob you and if you&rsquo;re a watchman, you gotta stay up all night to catch him so if your mental attitude is to watch for something inside this brain, you first gotta know what you&rsquo;re watching for and then you&rsquo;ll be able to recognize it when when you spot it. (Inaudible) we have been told of what to watch for in all the scriptures of the East or in Jewish Scriptures, Jesus put it a very simple, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single, the body is full of light.&rdquo; Now we&rsquo;ve been talking before of truth in terms of atomic science, the laws of creation, I said we&rsquo;re going to observe creation and become one with it, noumena not phenomena and so if your body is gonna become full of light, illumened now, we&rsquo;re talking of something that has to do with scientific principles because what is vision? Vision is based on a light principle, it&rsquo;s based on light hitting the retina with a photosynthesis process where it captures the image, a light image, and it&rsquo;s transferred into the brain like a camera so we say you have a photographic memory, you see the thing once and you never lose it no more, the impressions is there, well let&rsquo;s get to it more accurately now without beating around the bush. We&rsquo;re dealing with actual physics now, there is a certain quanta of light transferred to these sensitive chemicals in here so this man Jesus knew what he&rsquo;s talking about, he knew it in a period that was never even aware of the structure of matter beyond the mere sensation of touch you see. That why he said, &ldquo;If thine eyes be single&rdquo; like two beams on a car, it&rsquo;s driving it becomes one light now, &ldquo;the whole body is full of light,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re gonna see inside this atomic principle of your body. Now let&rsquo;s see if it is really true that this is atomic energy, we&rsquo;re living in an age where it has been demonstrated to us that matter is of an atomic structure, it took a man called Einstein to come and prove to us that matter is energy and energy is light principle and it is consciousness. Now ancient people said this whole world is Maya. Einstein says, &ldquo;Yes it&rsquo;s Maya but give it a scientific name it&rsquo;s relativity.&rdquo; What is relativity? It&rsquo;s is a principle of light dealing with the life principle, it&rsquo;s dealing with polarity so Maya is duality, that is polarity, duality, same thing. The ancients are using certain languages or symbols to represent laws of physics and when we see it in its true context you see for the first time not churchianity, we&rsquo;re seeing the spirituality of nature or the divinity of our nature. We&rsquo;re seeing now cosmic principal for the first time, we&rsquo;re seeing what we really are so what is Man now, is he Soul? &ldquo;Come let us make Man in my own image and likeness, male of female create them and breathed into Man the breath of life and Man became a living Soul.&rdquo; All right he&rsquo;s a living Soul but we know that Soul is a reflection of a particular principle and we know that only by intuitive observation we can confirm this and by intuitive oneness we can expeirence this. We have to go back to the statement, Come let us make Man in our own image and likeness&rdquo; all right there is nothing outside. making Man with two things: image / likeness. Meditation has all the two powers involved with it: mind / energy so energy would be the image, the atomic principle itself, and mind would be the lightness because it was have the omnipresence in it, the total memories so Man in his total consciousness of cosmic consciousness or his super consciousness is identified with this principle. There is no period in consciousness that he&rsquo;s not identified, he knows it complete but he cannot communicate it, that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s called Soul. A living Soul, there&rsquo;s no way for living Soul to communicate so it can only utilize a physical mechanism to transmit some glimpse or some function or some part of the mechanics of an unusual nature but it can&rsquo;t come through it, Soul it can do many things to this mechanism but it can come through it. Soul can make this mechanism defy decay so when a Master sayd you&rsquo;re looking at Soul, you&rsquo;re looking at God, you&rsquo;re looking at consciousness, you don&rsquo;t have a Soul but you are Soul. Now when they say you are Soul that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re an individual thing now, strange eh? You are more than the individual turned Soul. A Master when he uses the word like Jesus, &ldquo;I and my Father on one,&rdquo; that statement tells you a lot more scientifically speaking now for the first time because &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re talking now of a very very deep atomic principle that has yet to be discovered, &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father,&rdquo; &ldquo;I and my Father only one,&rdquo; only a few Masters that came on this Earth have the capacity or the full realization to offer those words with full conviction and use it. Men saying it haphazardly like that has no value, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, it doesn&rsquo;t prove anything, until a man is realized within himself, this identity, this oneness of the noumena as to what his whole mechanism is made up, he&rsquo;s in  no position to make such a statement but when he seized it and he began to see the atomic principles already working inside from meditation and he strives to surrender, to become one with it, at that moment in vibratory creation and non-vibratory creation lock onto each other like a satellite and just at that borderline state it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;So Hong&rdquo; in Sanskrit, &ldquo;I and my Father are one&rdquo; because you are vibratory creation right here now but you can only go back to non-vibratory creation by consciousness, by speeding up this consciousness and at that moment when it&rsquo;s speeded up, there is a sensing of oneness. Hence you hear the words in yogic terminology of Samadhi, entering into Samadhi, entering into at-one-ment or oneness. Now the Hebrew people knew Samadhi way back in Abraham time but they lost that and what came down through their priests craft is atonement. 0:50
There&rsquo;s not a single thing in this world to atone for, I know they will throw me out of the synagog but I told him many times they never did. There&rsquo;s not a single thing in this world to atone for it to nobody either, the pure consciousness can only be &ldquo;at-one,&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t atone for consciousness that&rsquo;s why even their own Romans writings in the scripture said, &ldquo;There is no condemnation in God,&rdquo; you go lookup your book, there&rsquo;s a statement there that says there is no condemnation in God so if there is no condemnation in God how come the term atonement (inaudible). The Yom Kippur has been so distorted it has become now atonement for at-one-ment and the early mystics of that particular group of people had at-one-ment, they experienced at-one-ment, they experienced this higher consciousness but then it&rsquo;s lost and you go into Oriental writings you&rsquo;ll see, the Bhagavad Gita there&rsquo;s nothing there to atone for. What they&rsquo;ll tell you is exactly what Jesus said, &ldquo;What you sow, you reap,&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t plant tomatoes and get oranges, you can&rsquo;t think negative and get positive. If you are the result of thinking and if you make all your plans and you end up thinking positive or negative, this is strictly you, you are to blame and nobody else, you can&rsquo;t throw the responsibility on mama, you can&rsquo;t throw the responsibility on your neighbor, you can always throw the responsibility back on yourself. You are still the individual who think it up, you&rsquo;re the individual that has to pay the price, you gotta jump to the tune you know, you&rsquo;re not going any place. So in the East it&rsquo;s called cause and effect or law of action, some people have a terminology for it they call it Karma but and in its true aspect it&rsquo;s exactly what Jesus would call it &ldquo;What is sow, you reap.&rdquo; A farmer knows that, he plants, you gotta get this. Now you go to a much deeper aspect of thinking you&rsquo;ll find now, as I said before, the highest state of realization is the ability to materialize your thoughts at will. Now let&rsquo;s see if this is not true in your scriptures, &ldquo;As a Man thinketh in his heart that is what he is.&rdquo; Now let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t apply thinking to materialize objects around you but you type apply thinking to alter your behavior, to alter many things about your negative attitudes to life and make yourself a whole Man for the first time, this is applying thought to matter now because that&rsquo;s matter. If you&rsquo;re aching in the body or something and you got some dilemma, if you can probe into yourself and get into yourself, you&rsquo;re going to change it, but you gotta make the decision, nobody can make that for you. We can lead you to the water but we can&rsquo;t make you drink. The meditation is not a cure-all, it&rsquo;s not a do it yourself way to God, it is a process through which you come face to face with yourself. Now there&rsquo;s something else about meditation, meditation does not progress in a straight line, as I said you&rsquo;d wish you&rsquo;d never entered into it because the moment you start trying to correct anything from within, everything starts crashing in on you because you&rsquo;re starting a process of acceleration, you&rsquo;re causing things to be speeded up in order to work them out. Now in the presence of a Master, the proportionate ratio that he will allow you to work this thing out, he will take it (inaudible) to see that you get it at a certain period, that you can handle it, you&rsquo;ll have enough strength, enough capacity, strength of character, persistency, will, peace, to cope with each particular problem and at the same time provide the necessary means to see that its taken care of without any mental or physical distress to you. Now that doesn&rsquo;t say the Master is gonna haul you by the nose and do all this for you at same time, he&rsquo;s going to slow down many things for you but he&rsquo;s gonna let you work it out yourself too. This is what Jesus meant, &ldquo;Take up your cross and follow me,&rdquo; you gotta haul your own load but you&rsquo;re hauling your own load at your own particular pace with the assurance that he is going to be interested to see that you have enough comprehension of what you&rsquo;re taking upon yourself and to work with it, he&rsquo;s not leaving you to yourself. Now this is one thing about a Master but then you see a Master there ain&rsquo;t too many of them. In the first place you don&rsquo;t choose a Master, most people say &ldquo;Well I hear there&rsquo;s such and such a man teaching meditation, I&rsquo;m going to run to him, he&rsquo;s my Guru.&rdquo; Phooey, that&rsquo;s a bunch of nonsense, Jesus said to his own disciples, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t choose me, I chose you&rdquo; so a Master chooses his disciple and he ain&rsquo;t got too many either, all the Master&rsquo;s people who flock around him aren&rsquo;t his disciples, maybe they would be a good bunch of hanger-on&rsquo;s but they ain&rsquo;t his disciples. When he chooses a disciple or takes the interest in that individual&rsquo;s well being to see him through the process, he&rsquo;s going to take on many obligations but that doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s not interested in people who come to him with their problems and request some kind of help and want something of him because you can lead these people by the nose you know, they&rsquo;re the living embodiment of compassion and love, they will do something for you but in proportion to how much devotion you&rsquo;ve got for God in yourself and I don&rsquo;t say God is on a throne you know, the inner principles within yourself, the inner light in yourself, proportionately how much you want to put forward in this attitude to life. Now it&rsquo;s not an attitude that breeds fear, it&rsquo;s not an attitude that breeds suspicion, doubt, and superstition, it&rsquo;s an attitude that must breed freedom, free men all lord of yourself, but you don&rsquo;t make yourself tall by cutting off the heads of other people to be free, you make yourself tall in proportion to your devotion and humility and you&rsquo;re not out to impress nobody either, it&rsquo;s only important if anybody wants to believe what you believe in. In fact you&rsquo;re not out even to proselytize or convert the next guy, leave him to his own dilemmas. As long as you don&rsquo;t hurt his feelings or you don&rsquo;t hurt no one&rsquo;s feelings and you go about your business, this world is a vast pool anyhow, you can&rsquo;t take on the world&rsquo;s worries on your shoulders anyhow, you only take on your own little sack, your own little cross, but you have compassion you see the other man is struggling you may put a good word in here and there to give him a little encouragment to think people, but don&rsquo;t try to think for him, leave him to think for himself so meditation brings you to something. As I said now it&rsquo;s not running in a straight line, it&rsquo;s running in troughs, up and down, you&rsquo;re gonna have dry spells in meditation where there&rsquo;s absolutely not a single thing occurring inside of you and these are periods that are called by certain mystics or devotees of God as &ldquo;night of the Soul.&rdquo; Can you imagine that the Soul has a night or can you imagine that the Soul has a day? Don&rsquo;t you see how it throws the whole thing out of place because certain terminology throws the whole truth out of context. There is no night, there is no day in the Soul. For every effort you made to move, to alter your attitude to life or your environment around you, we&rsquo;re gonna meet with an opposition, a natural intrinsic resistance in all things exist, this is basic, you can&rsquo;t run away from it, you have to face it but you&rsquo;re not gonna face it in a beaten way or face it that you&rsquo;re gonna be destroyed by it. 1:00 (Gap in tape) you are meditating in the waking state, you&rsquo;re mentally directing energy on your own individual attitudes to communicate, to observe, independent of the senses all the beautiful noumena, Man, standing in front of you, he&rsquo;s not a phenomena, you see. Right in the waking state you are applying this principle, you don&rsquo;t have to sit down like a lump there in the corner and hide in the dark to do it only, that is preparation, that is not living, you&rsquo;re living meditation, this process, all the time night and day, there is no limited period for it, you are actually living it but between you and this other person there is an adjustment now after the resistance is broken down, you start feeling for each other, it&rsquo;s called a psychological fencing, you&rsquo;re doing it, we&rsquo;re all doing it, why? Fear of the unknown, when there is no fear then there is warmth, it radiates, now because you&rsquo;re not free, when you&rsquo;re free it radiates right away, you see a person there&rsquo;s a flow right away to that person. Now when this adjustment period is wearing off you notice there&rsquo;s a change now, there are certain changes in communication, certain things you find familiar to both of you, certain things that you seem to identify with and that&rsquo;s your mutation period, you want to modify, you want to correct, &ldquo;Well maybe this guy&rsquo;s got something on the ball, maybe you got something on the ball,&rdquo; both of you are exchanging now psychological notes, physical notes about life. Then comes a pattern, you&rsquo;re buddy buddy buddy now, you know each other, your telephone numbers and you&rsquo;re established, you know his business association and you&rsquo;re friends, that pattern sets in and you can go along for quite a while providing you are growing and he&rsquo;s growing. That&rsquo;s why when there&rsquo;s a moment of stagnation where there is no growing, what begins to happen? You run into saturation, there&rsquo;s a cooling off of your association and this can drag on now, lag for a period, then it warms up again. Now your meditation is following this principle all the time, every time you go away from the Guru or you go away from your friend or your friend go away from you there is a warming up period, it starts all over again. That&rsquo;s why they go for Darshan, they go for this warming up processes, they go like a dead battery needs to jumper battery to give it a boost when it stalls in the highway, you see. You meet someone in the meditative mood or in the meditative circle, there&rsquo;s an exchange of warmth and feeling, when they&rsquo;re out of sight the next time you meet there is a warming up sometimes much more than the first time, it&rsquo;s magnified more and you may sit back at your home and qualify the various people you&rsquo;ve met and there is one or two of that group that you radiate to automatically, you seem to synchronize with them, you seem to commune with them, this is going on in meditation too. You don&rsquo;t even have to sit down and close your eyes to get the meditation, this is going to work right through right there, this is your waking meditation, this is what you&rsquo;re recognizing about yourself, that you are meditating already in a waiting State. Now your mind, I said before, will drift in meditation, you have to have something to center it on so the ancient men were wise enough to devise mantras, sound repetition, you can even boil it down to make it mechanical in the form of Rudraksha beads, rosaries, they even went to the mechanical aspect of it, you have to have something to keep your mind dedicated on because it&rsquo;s gonna wander and an idle mind ain&rsquo;t gonna do much, it&rsquo;s got to keep sharpening up, it&rsquo;s gotta be (inaudible) thinking so when you sit down to meditate you are thinking of some particular phrase or affirmation or terminology or word or sounds to set this process going. First it can be loud, second it can be inaudible to the extent that the tongue don&rsquo;t move in a repetition of the sound, it&rsquo;s just a mental action, till you get absorbed in it and it&rsquo;s that moment of absorption comes the break that you break away now, for the first time you can concentrate but they knew this to be the most logical way to get to the inside. Now they also knew that it was difficult for people to feel familiar with beads or repeat sounds or mantras so they went one step further, they developed sounds, music, and it&rsquo;s a form of musical therapy. Your mind is restless from the travelling around on the highway almost knocking the other guy over, he&rsquo;s knocking you over, you come in in the room and you want to calm down, play a little bit of music, little Brahms, little Bach and before you know it, you&rsquo;re calming down. You start calming down, why? It&rsquo;s giving you time to get back to your real self. Now this calming down process through music is beneficial, has a certain therapeutic value, then you&rsquo;re able to slow down and begin repeating some mental thought or even picking up some part of that music and getting identified with it. So you are now going into yourself again, you see how they worked out simple methods to get to the self. Then comes the most advanced part of meditation, after all the preliminaries are over comes initiation, that&rsquo;s like John the Baptist and Jesus, they got together at the River Jordan and they&rsquo;re gonna argue now, &ldquo;Brother you baptized me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No you baptized me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brother you baptize me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No brother you baptize me&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re gonna argue back and forth gonna who&rsquo;s going to baptize who. Two grown up men trying to argue about something and one is saying, &ldquo;There cometh one who baptizes with the spirit who shoes I&rsquo;m not even worthy to unlatch.&rdquo; &ldquo;I baptize with water,&rdquo; what does it really mean? You mean to tell me the child that has been baptized at age one or age six months or five days old is illumened? Here the man comes when he&rsquo;s almost 30 years of age to be a little water thrown on his head, that makes him illumened? It&rsquo;s got to be more than that, I&rsquo;ve been to many where they dunk you you know, the whole body inside, some things happen at those places, I don&rsquo;t want to tell you the joke (laughter). Well but that doesn&rsquo;t make you illumened, there had to be something beyond that. The symbology in that baptism came from the East, John knew it, John was a student from Essene Brotherhood and the Essenes never cut their hair, they grew their beards and they were vegetarians. They were the mystical group of the Hebrew race and they were the ones who practiced meditation, the rest never practiced. The Pharisees, they didn&rsquo;t practice meditation, it was the Essenes that practiced meditation you see and they practiced meditation and they lived on a non-meat diet because  he said he lived on locusts and wild honey. Well who can eat locusts with two wings and four legs you know how many locusts you gotta catch every day to eat? So you know it&rsquo;s certainly not the grasshopper we&rsquo;re talking about, we know locust to mean carob. It was called St. John&rsquo;s bread in those days but today we know its botanical name is Carob, it looks like chocolate. If you ever taste the actual carob, it&rsquo;s a very very tasty thing, has a brown skin, hard like coconut shell, you can polish it, it looks like a tamarind, it&rsquo;s like a glassy tamarind, you break it open it has big stones inside like that, covered with a flush meat, brownish rusty looking, and if you rub it is like powder. 1:10 And they grate that and make carob and it looks just like chocolate powder and it&rsquo;s very high in vitamins and minerals so John was living off of that and wild honey, you couldn&rsquo;t get better honey than wild honey because the bees aren&rsquo;t restricted in no spray flea-bitten area, they draw natural honey and he lived on that. Now he lived by the river baptizing people but I&rsquo;m talking of initiation between two advanced beings now, a man who had prepared himself for initiation versus many who were unprepared. You only get the advantage, the full advantage, of initiation when you are thoroughly prepared from within all the qualities then boom, this is like a capstone. He lived for approximately 18 years unrecorded by the Hebrew people but it was not unrecorded by oriental people, there are manuscripts which can be attested today now in Tibet and in China and in India that he did live in those areas. Well you see Jesus went to pay respect to three Masters that came to visit him at his birth, this is an unusual thing, how would three Masters who live in three distinct parts of the world forsee the coming of a realized Master, move from their own independent nature with the three gifts to go and visiting a man in the Middle East and if any Master has any sense of obligation, the first obligation is to repay the respect back to the Guru&rsquo;s, these Masters, you go back to see them. Now what was written on this on the piece of scroll of gold that was given to him, no one has a record of that, they say they brought him gold, frankincense, and myrrh Nobody brings you a slab of gold, it gotta have some inscription if it&rsquo;s a highly civilization nation, you carry somebody a piece of gold, even if it&rsquo;s a gold coin it&rsquo;s gonna have some inscription. So there had to be something written on that gold tablet that was given to the boy at birth that had something to do with making him go away at the age of 12 to seek out and the frankincense which is used for burying people or incense which is called frankincense, that case in which it was made would have to have inscriptions pertaining to it and these were all given to him and his mother couldn&rsquo;t keep it so the man definitely we are talking of something that is not unusual in the Oriental countries. In the case of Yogananda, his mother had an amulet materialize in her hand that was supposed to be given to him at her death and there came to her a Swami one day and says, &ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re about to leave this world but I have a message for your son from the great Masters. To prove the truth of my message to you mother, when you meditate tomorrow morning there is an amulet that is going to materialize in your hand. Only your son, your second son, is going to know the true meaning of it.&rdquo; And she was meditating and there behold the amulet, like a medallion, manifested in her hands. She kept it locked up, never gave it to the second son, until she was ready to die and when she wanted her eldest son to be so close to get hold of it and to be sure that he got this to the boy, the second son got the medallion and when Yogananda got the medallion, he knew exactly what it meant, he read into the scroll of it and he daily communed with the Masters through the medallion. Now this is a man who lived up to 1952 and now he lived in America so I&rsquo;m not going to tell you something way back in thousands of years that this type of thing don&rsquo;t exist, this is a common practice throughout the Oriental countries among Oriental people to make this kind of contribution. So I know that it had to happen in the same way with Jesus that he was given these things to make communication so he prepared himself from 12 to 30 and in that preparation he came back to his people around that River Jordan to be initiated by his Guru, John, and after he was initiated this inner consciousness opened and then he went and go through what you would call now temptation with the devil? No I don&rsquo;t call it temptation with the devil, it is a struggle between intuition and ego, the real struggle between the intuitive life and the ego life. The ego life tells you &ldquo;you stupid man, hey you hungry? What are you starving yourself for? Eat some food, don&rsquo;t get so skinny.&rdquo;  The intuitive life says, &ldquo;No Man don&rsquo;t live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s a bunch of nonsense, where do you get that from? You must have got that from bunch of grafted Orientals&rsquo; brain, you grafted it off from somebody, you&rsquo;re like the Westerners now who are grafting on Oriental philosophy to their brain. Stop that nonsense, eat a piece of meat man, get with it, get on the ball.&rdquo; This is the struggle, &ldquo;What am I sitting like a lump here trying to do my meditation, wasting time! Let&rsquo;s get with this thing, get up and go back there and do your duty to the world.&rdquo; This is a struggle, everyone has that conflict being initiated, a conflict begins at the highest point of meditation as to his real Dharma or duty, his real obligation to life. This conflict is there, now to run away in the world and hide in some corner is not the answer because no one ever made it that way. To sit down and fight it out in your daily activities, yes you&rsquo;re gonna make it, proportionately as you struggle, proportionately wisdom flowing. We have to create a vacuum for this consciousness, you have to create it by action, you have to do something physically to create this principle, to make it move in you, you definitely got to work it, you got to stay here and do, so where did he go? He stayed there to work it out and then came back and live with his people, he didn&rsquo;t find it but the question is this: &ldquo;Man don&rsquo;t live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a nice statement, let&rsquo;s see this is really scientific or it&rsquo;s just another poetical statement. &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; that means male and female, &ldquo;does not live by bread alone&rdquo; that would mean the human mechanism does not survive strictly by solid and liquid of a vibratory nature alone, if it did you&rsquo;d have to stuff a dead man in his mouth and see if he&rsquo;ll come back with bread and water. He&rsquo;s dead now, if bread alone would make him stay alive, put it in a dead man&rsquo;s mouth and see if he&rsquo;s gonna get up and walk, prove he doesn&rsquo;t live by that alone, there are other things that he lives by. He don&rsquo;t live by books because book reading in those days were very limited, he doesn&rsquo;t live by scrolls because scroll writing was very limited. We gotta go into a deeper understanding, what else? &ldquo;But by every word,&rdquo; the word every comes in, not by the word, but by every word, very important to realize the difference between &ldquo;by the word&rdquo; or &ldquo;by the every word.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;by the word&rdquo; has a different scientific meaning, &ldquo;by the every word&rdquo; has a different scientific meaning, &ldquo;but by every word.&rdquo; Now what you&rsquo;re hearing coming out of my mouth and communicating to your brain, you call them words, but that is only sound vibration, therefore there are certain sound vibrations that are passing through us unknown to us that are sustaining us and this vibration must have an atomic nature in some form or manner. Right now you&rsquo;re not eating bread to stay alive and for days you can go without eating and why you don&rsquo;t die? And they have many Yogis that have gone hundreds of days, I know one Yogi, 300 years of age, 300 pounds he weighed, a pound for every year of his life and he never eats much, when he broke his fast once in every nine months and you know what you drank when he broke his fast? Clabbered milk and a guy thought he was a nut or a faker or something and brough him a bucket of quicklime and says, &ldquo;Here Yogi, you&rsquo;re such a smart man, why don&rsquo;t you drink some clabbered milk.&rdquo; 1:20 And the Yogi says, &ldquo;All right son,&rdquo; started to drink. He never questioned the integrity of the man but in ten minutes you hear the man is shouting, &ldquo;Help Yogi I&rsquo;m dying, save me I&rsquo;m dying, I&rsquo;m burning up&rdquo; and he look at him, &ldquo;Scoffer, that was intended to destroy me, the great intelligence is only giving you back what you deserve, go in peace now, you&rsquo;re healed&rdquo; and that guy was cured from that mental problem that Yogi (inaudible), there&rsquo;s a big statue of him, he weighs 300 pounds and there&rsquo;s a pound for each year of his life, he was 300 years of age at the time. He passed away in 1962, gave up the body in a temple in South India but this happened a long time ago but I&rsquo;m showing you what is connected with this principle of every word, &ldquo;every word that proceed out of the mouth of God&rdquo; so there are cosmic vibrations that are passing through our mechanism and where is this mouth to God now? We say God is not somebody sitting on a throne, certainly he can&rsquo;t have a mouth, it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous but we have an entrance in our mechanism which acts like a mouth that energy enters us or the life force enters us and doctors are aware of it, that area is where the energy would enter and it&rsquo;s the only area in the body we cannot operate on. They can operate in any other area of the body but if you touch this particular spot it&rsquo;s instantaneous death and that is called the medulla oblongata. If you touch it you die instantly, if you tickle it with a feather you&rsquo;re paralyzed for life. Now that seems to act as a resonator for certain rays that we are not capable of recognizing right now, that doesn&rsquo;t say in time to come these rays are not gonna be observed and be catalogued on what actually are passing through us. The time will come as Man advances because that is his heritage, his heritage is to know himself thoroughly but Jesus is saying this thing, this Master is saying something a thousand years ahead of its time so we&rsquo;re talking of something that is very very scientific in itself so we know where this energy can enter us and we can by certain techniques that the Sages have developed through meditation, direct this energy through the body and they have given it. I don&rsquo;t know of any technique known in the Science of the Soul that Jesus never taught, he taught them all but it is for the wise individual to find them in his sayings, to go find them, they&rsquo;re all there. You have to look at them a little more with a different eye now, not in the usual eye, you have to see it in a different way but that meditation is that this energy comes in and you draw it so we know what we&rsquo;re saying now, &ldquo;Every word,&rdquo; all the rays that are passing through from the universe to us are hooked in, all these rays are hooked into one cosmic ray or one cosmic vibration or one cosmic sound now. It&rsquo;s like a rain shooting out, you ever see a faucet? The water is all shooting out from the faucet but it&rsquo;s all coming from one source, this water is just one. Now initiation has to do with this, you are locked on to this one source, this one energy is called the audible life stream for scientific people who want to have a name for it. They referr to it as a stream, water, so you can see for throwing a little water on your head and baptize you, why the symbolism of water came into it, there&rsquo;s no actual water on the head. It&rsquo;s the fact that you can refer to this thing as a audible life stream, it flows and has a sound and you are connected to the sound. Now this sound has many different notes. Usually here the first sound is a bell, if you hear the bell it pulls you up, that&rsquo;s the origin of your bell in churches, that&rsquo;s why you find there&rsquo;s an affinity for people who hear the bell tolling, they don&rsquo;t know why it seems to suit their nature and make them think pensively or they don&rsquo;t want to think something more cosmic in nature or more divine in nature, that bell sound triggers that but that&rsquo;s the very lowest note you&rsquo;ll hear in meditation. The highest note you hear in meditation is the bagpipe but there&rsquo;s one sound above the bagpipe that nobody can tell you what it is but they hear it just the same. The only way you can describe that note that is way above the bagpipe note&hellip; you know if you think of the Scotsman as being foolish, he is pretty wise that he invented the bagpipe up in the highlands (laughter), the high-lands you know, not just the little mountains of Scotland, scot-land, you&rsquo;ve got to dig into this wisdom they&rsquo;re talking about. The bagpipe has a very unusual shrill, when you take all these sounds and you condense them, it will sound like a fantastic electronic motor at work, it will be as if the sound of all the atoms in motion if you can hear it and you have to hear it because there is where you&rsquo;re going to discover for the first time that &ldquo;no church can bind Him as their own but every atom is his throne&rdquo; and this is your first exposure to divinity. There in that state you&rsquo;re gonna recognize or realize there&rsquo;s not a single philosophy in this earth here that can completely tell you the truth about yourself yet every atom that you perceive and is passing through you reveals Him to you. Think for one moment that you can close your eyes and witness the distance of light crosses the width of an electron (long pause) yet you have no way to measure it yet you can see it and you know it&rsquo;s there, you can see the width of it and the mathematician would want to measure it, &ldquo;I would like to measure that distance&rdquo; and the whole body is full of light. Now you see why he&rsquo;s talking of light all the time because in there you&rsquo;re gonna see this thing, it&rsquo;s inside. Before we do a little meditation is there any question? Audience: Speaking of the Scots fantastic bravery in the second war (inaudible). Adano: It&rsquo;s not a sound that you like, it&rsquo;s a high shrill and it gives you all kinds of unusual feelings. Audience: Because it seems to very inspiring you know. Adano: Because you cannot march to it, it&rsquo;s not a sound that you can march to, it doesn&rsquo;t resonate or affect any of you lower endocrine system, it doesn&rsquo;t affect your heart, there&rsquo;s no feel for melody in there in that sound when it&rsquo;s blowing yet it seems to pull on your eardrums very tremendously and pull on the forehead tremendously in the top of the skull and yet you when you hear it, there&rsquo;s a sense of taking a deep breath and raising your chest up for the first time to move. It&rsquo;s like a rallying call, it&rsquo;s a strange thing and when a Scotsman first heard it in itself in his meditation up in the higherlands, he tried to duplicate it by making one, he accomplished it, he did accomplish capturing that high sound in consciousness. Every sound in the inner consciousness have been made already in an instrument on this Earth except the one sound, the sound of the atoms, cannot capture that. That&rsquo;s why they say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; in the beginning with this one sound or cosmic vibration or principle, the very start of creation. Vibratory creation I&rsquo;m talking of because creation is unmanifest as well as manifest. 1:30 From the unmanifest state or reservoir it has to resonate and move out, that sound that resonates is the atom starting from there, from consciousness. So that sound no one can really capture the instrument but you can hear that distinctly in meditation and especially when you initiate it, you hear it very strong, it goes on strong inside and it pulls you like an escalator up. Which is why you say you don&rsquo;t dictate to God, you have to surrender to this presence, any other questions? Well let&rsquo;s try a little meditation. Now the proof of the pudding is in eating it. (Gap in tape). Audience: You got the tape recorder on? Ladies and gentlemen I&rsquo;m so happy to welcome you on this auspicious occasion, we&rsquo;re just testing one two three four on talking. Now let me talk in a very low voice, you have your volume pretty well on? (Group chatter). Adano: Ramakrishna, one time and he was in his house and he was with a group of his disciples and then a cat was trying to walk around the house and everybody was trying to keep the cat away so all of a sudden the cat waited until they were busy all chanting and made a mad dash for Ramakrishna lap. So by the time they got up to catch the cat, the cat is in Ramakrishna lap so he says, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t take him back, he made it to God.&rdquo; (Laughter). You see the animal knows and it wants to get there too so imagine we&rsquo;re in the human body, what is our desire? We want to get that bliss because the cat was all bliss when he was in the lap of Ramakrishna. Audience: Myrtle called just a few minutes ago and she was on her way. Audience: Adano, all those beautiful stories about Sri Bhagavan and the animals in his ashram and the monkey (inaudible then general group chatter). Adano Ley is going to meditate with us and give us words of wisdom. (Group chatter). 1:40 Adano: I think this is the time you ask some questions, we can break it down and go into it. Audience: Maybe to talk a little bit about how a householder Yogi, how he gets along with living in the world and yet still being able to meditate. Adano: That&rsquo;s very good because this is what we&rsquo;re involved with, a Yogi is not a Swami, we are two distinct people. A yogi is a person, male, yogini is female, who follows a definite science step by step towards realization of God within himself thus attaining mastery. A Swami is an individual, man or woman, mostly men, who take the vow of renunciation and seek to understand the self, Swa the self, master of the self but may not follow a definite yogic science, this is a big difference. They take the vow of renunciation, the vow of Brahachari or celibacy, and they may not follow any definite science. Now the yogi, like Sri Yukteswar and like Lahiri Mahasaya, these were men who lived in the world, were married, had children, had tremendous technical knowledge in science and then they decided to follow a definite science of realization and attained full God realization in themselves. When Sri Yukteswar&rsquo;s wife died, having no children of his own, he then one day was visiting Babaji, his teacher&rsquo;s teacher, at the Kumbha Mela and while looking around in the group of people he heard someone says &ldquo;There is a Saint who would like to talk to you&rdquo; so he walked over to see who&rsquo;s was this Saint because all he could see here was a bunch of Swamis and Sadhus but he didn&rsquo;t see any spiritual radiance in them. Just then he came up to the Saint who was a young Man with a group of disciples and here he saw something unusual, there was a quality of love, and this young man said to him, &ldquo;Welcome Swami.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Swami&rdquo; so the young man said &ldquo;Those who I have bestowed the title, don&rsquo;t normally throw it off easily&rdquo; so you see how the title comes now. This was an honorary title bestowed upon a man who was not following the path of renunciation or taking any spiritual vow and yet this honorary title was bestowed upon him and he cast off this by saying &ldquo;I am NOT a Swami, I don&rsquo;t belong to no religious order, I haven&rsquo;t taken no vow.&rdquo; So admonished by saying, &ldquo;Those who I give this title to don&rsquo;t throw it off,&rdquo; then in his consciousness he realized that this might be his teacher&rsquo;s teacher because as he looked at the man closely he saw he looked like a younger version of his own teacher. Now this is the unusual part of it, his teacher is already in his sixties and his teacher&rsquo;s teacher is looking like a man of 21/22 so seems kind of odd, how can a man way up in his sixties lay claim to a teacher younger than himself but that&rsquo;s not the point, the Soul see. Now this was Babaji he met, the avatar Babaji and he bestowed the title of Swami on him. Now he told him, &ldquo;I see you have great love for the people of the West.&rdquo; Now he&rsquo;s still not a Swami, he&rsquo;s just an ordinary yogi who has been initiated by his Guru in a formal science of God realization and here he is attending a Kumbla Mela and seeing these people and they didn&rsquo;t impress him as much as this Babaji did and he saying to Babaji, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you wasting time here with your wonderful darshan, your beautiful radiant light? Why you could send this knowledge to the people in the West who have great scientific accomplishments, they have real need for such a science.&rdquo; So the teacher said to Sri Yukteswar, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge the people because they are not spiritually illumined as you think, every man comes to God in his own way.&rdquo; Now the wise ant will always select the grain of sugar out of a handful of sand, he&rsquo;ll never go home with a sand so it is the one man who can come to a Kumbla Mela and spot the one radiant light and go to it. Here is the one man also being bestowed the title honorary Swami. He came to Kumbla Mela and there are thousands of people there calling themselves Swamis, yet here is one man given this title and yet he meets the one man who is the radiant sugar in the whole handful of sand, you see what a marvelous relationship going on? So he said &ldquo;Well someday, since you have so much love for people in the West, I will send you a Soul that you can train in yoga.&rdquo; Now he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;in Swami&rdquo; in Yoga, now we&rsquo;re dealing with the householder question, how can a householder, not Swami, householder yogi, perform his duties and realize himself, there is no householder Swami, there&rsquo;s householder yogi. Now someday I will send you a Soul that you will train in yoga and you&rsquo;ll send him to the West. Now this Soul eventually came to this Swami but the Swami at that time was for an honorary degree, not formal, he had to go now to the real church, the real temple, and go through the rights of being officially initiated as a Swami and take the vows of renunciation, Brahmachari, but he could not take it before because he was still a married man, his wife had just passed away now. Now he can take it, he&rsquo;s not giving up anything that he did not experience, he&rsquo;s not renouncing something out of regret, he&rsquo;s not renouncing something out of shame or disgrace, it is from accomplishment you see. He has the quality now to accept the vow of Swami whereas some people they take the vow of Swami to escape responsibility of living in the world and this is not what the Masters are trying to teach. The Masters can show you that you can be a householder yogi and take on the vow of Swami after, this is what we would call now spiritual retirement, you&rsquo;ve served your householder life, your children are now grown up and you turn your business over to them, now you can take on the vow of Swami and live with your wife as sister and brother in the ashram with the Guru, that is renunciation, that is the Sanasaya path, that is the path of renunciation, first time you can do it legitimately without any attraction, compulsion, or subtle mental current you see, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re taking on the vow of a monk, you see that&rsquo;s the monastic way. 1:50 Now, so Sri Yukteswar eventually had to go and take the vows formally from someone, some pundit, and he took it from a certain branch of the Swami order. There are eight branches of the Swami order, the last name of the person&rsquo;s name indicates what branch of the Swami order he comes from so he is called Sri Yukteswar Giri, the mountain. You see he took the vow from the branch of the Swami order as the mountain if he had called himself Sri Yukteswar Sagar then that would be from the ocean. If you&rsquo;re taking the vow Sri Yukteswar Saraswati, that would mean wisdom so whatever the last word indicate was the branch or connecting link to the order that he belonged to. Now years went by and he think he might have had a mental hallucination because no Soul came to him to train to send to the West, all the people that were slowly hanging around his house come for meditation, he didn&rsquo;t see one yet but there was a boy who grew up and one day he&rsquo;s walking down the lane and he sees this man standing there and every time he moves towards the man his feet stumbles and he moves away from the man his feet are stuck, he can&rsquo;t go away from the man, he can&rsquo;t even move to the man. This young boy&rsquo;s name was Mukunda Lal Ghosh and he&rsquo;s looking at Swami Sri Yukteswar, not knowing who he is but Mukunda Lal Ghosh used to have inner visions in his meditation, he would always see a face of a man in his meditation and as he approached this man on the lane, this face in the vision was exactly the face of this man standing in the lane and he recognized that this man was his Guru so he ran to the man and touched him on the feet and the man accepted it. Well he lived with Sri Yukteswar for ten years in Yukteswar&rsquo;s ashram and during that period, like a good school boy he must go to school and finish his education, Sri Yukteswar told him you&rsquo;ve got to go to school. So the first he met him he says &ldquo;You gotta go back to school&rdquo; so you can imagine here he wants to study the spiritual life and the teacher is saying you have to go to school because you&rsquo;re going to go to the West and they&rsquo;re not gonna look too lightly on you because you have to have some degree to say that you have authority in your knowledge, you pass some education, people are not going to listen to our dropout. Well this is a problem for here it happened long before there was such a word called dropout, I was a dropout too but in my time you can afford to drop out and go back to school after, today you&rsquo;re a dropout you still gotta go back to school and do it again either way, but Yogananda had to go back to school and he stayed in the ashram and worked and he learned to meditate then he even started his own little yoga school. Now before he started the yoga school, he graduated from university and he only wanted to meditate by himself, he did not want to get involved in ashram work or organizational work. So his Guru said to him one day, &ldquo;Why are you afraid of ashram work or you prefer to get married, become a householder?&rdquo; He says, Oh no Guru, I don&rsquo;t wanna be a householder, I want to follow God, I want to do God&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Yeah but you&rsquo;re gonna miss the comfort of a wife in your old age.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;No Guru, I love God too much.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay then, since you want to become a teacher of God then you want to take the vows of renunciation, take the vows of Brahmachari?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes Guru.&rdquo; So from the school boy university graduate now he is transformed into his first vow as Swami, he takes the vow of a Swami but all that time while he lived with the Guru he was training himself as a Yogi, he practiced a definite science to realize himself and achieve this consciousness inside then he decided he wanted to take the vow of Swami see. He didn&rsquo;t just take the vow of Swami to renounce the world, he first studied with his Guru and became a Yogi and he followed a definite process to achieve the realization of God and when he was asked to take the vow of Swami then his Guru asked him what name does he want as a monastic title? So after a long period of silence he says, &ldquo;I take the monastic name of Yogananda.&rdquo; Now the question is who is Yogananda? Let&rsquo;s see what the word means, why he chose that word to represent something. Before he took the vow of Swami, he was practicing yoga and he achieved the realization, he achieved the consciousness. Now he&rsquo;s taking the vow of Swami or the monastic title and he&rsquo;s assuming a new name now, he&rsquo;s leaving off his own family name and taking on the monastic name. So if he&rsquo;s taking it from his teacher who is from the Giri mountain so he also would be from the Giri so his name is Swami Yogananda Giri, from the mountain branch of Swami order. Yogananda means now, word yoga means union, Ananda means bliss, he found bliss through union with God and this realization, before assuming the Swami order, came to him long before and when he was taking on the order now, the monastic title of a Swami, this was his highest realization within himself so he assumed the name &ldquo;bliss through divine union with God.&rdquo; Now we know that God is not a person in the Sanata Dharma or the eternal religion of the universe, God is mentioned as Sat-Chit-Ananda which means the ever existing so it also means it never came into existence so it can&rsquo;t go out of existence, that eliminates beginning and end, it&rsquo;s the ever existing. Chit the ever conscious so consciousness has no start and has no end either and scientists will tell you the same thing, there is no start or end in creation or matter or energy, it was always there, ever existing in a state of flux, motion, and Ananda, bliss. Now certainly no one wants pain, if he&rsquo;s going to have eternal existence and eternal consciousness would you want eternal pain? You want eternal joy, the very nature of your being is to be joyful, the very nature of your being is bliss, so the divinity in Man is the ever existing, ever conscious, ever new bliss because bliss is not steady, bliss changes. (Gap in tape). 2:00 The householder yogi is the greatest challenge, more so than the renunciate yogi, there have being more household Saints on record with the highest realization than there have been renunciate Saints. All your kings in times gone back, King Janaka householder Saint, King Ashoka householder Saint, Rama and Sita householder Saints you see. There are more on record than the renunciate, we only have Jesus, Paramahansa Yogananda, and Saint Francis, and there are very few that are on record you lay out the record that has been written and you&rsquo;ll find there more householder Saints than the renunciation Saints. The householder Saint carries on the principle of &ldquo;greater the obstacle, greater the man,&rdquo; the renunciate Saint is commanded by divine authority to go and restore mankind in his fallen state. That&rsquo;s why you find the renunciant Masters come occasionally to lift us back up, they don&rsquo;t come all the time, only when mankind has dropped down in divinity, drop down in righteousness, drop down in behavior, we have renunciate Masters coming but as long as mankind keeps up his righteousness, keeps up his spirituality, the ideal is the householder Yogi, the householder Master. Master Kirpal Singh, Master Charan Singh all householder Yogis. Sathya Sai Baba came back for another purpose, he has reactivated all the Dharma and the teachings of India now and that was his purpose coming back but more than that Sai Baba is an example how a man would be in the Satya Yuga period, he is ahead of his time so we are seeing something in that dimension but we have living Masters who are married and are carrying on the duties of a householder Saint. So where is the science, where is the renunciation? All the Masters who were renunciates did practice a formal science before practicing renunciation. Yogananda did, Jesus did, and Buddha was a married man, Muhammad, these were all householder Saints, householder teachers, they came with a purpose, Abraham came, all these were householder people. You ask how can you do it? The Master has said this in his teachings, &ldquo;You cannot renounce what you have never experienced and you do not know how many incarnations you have lived and how many experiences you have locked up in you and you are only the result of desire.&rdquo; You have no desires, you don&rsquo;t need a human body, automatically you will merge in the vibrationless universe, pure love, pure light. The moment you have desire or craving, unfulfilled, the moment that desire is unfulfilled, that craving is unfulfilled, human body is necessary, human body is needed. You have to have that body to experience an unfulfilled desire and we do not know each one of us what we need to fulfill so once you&rsquo;re in the human body, you find the consciousness is driving you to experience, it&rsquo;s driving you to fulfill something, there is an inner urge to make some expression with your life and until this is complete, to say you will renounce is folly, you&rsquo;re only fooling yourself, you cannot renounce. Because what would happen? The moment you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m renouncing this&rdquo; something else comes along to attract you, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it and before you know it, another thing will come along. Audience: As long as you&rsquo;re attracted by something, there is need to fulfill it? Where there is a strong attraction for some experience, is this indicative that there is something needing fulfillment? Adano: Needing fulfillment and it will be with you all your life till you fulfill it. Audience: Just like the palace was for&hellip; Adano: Right for Lahiri Mahasaya. He saw himself and in this incarnation, here he was an engineer, and was well taken care of in the company he worked for, yet when he met his Master, his Master materialized a palace for him. So he asked his Master, &ldquo;Who is the palace for? What am I doing here to be initiated in this beautiful place?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;That was your last desire you had in your last incarnation, to own a palace, you envy some King. So until that desire is satisfied, your unequipped, you don&rsquo;t have the capacity to lead the spiritual life.&rdquo; So he materialized the palace for him and he walked through the palace and examined everything, then all of a sudden the craving for a palace and the responsibility of a palace came to him, &ldquo;Oh no, I don&rsquo;t want this! All these rooms I gotta take care of!&rdquo; That was the realization, freed at last, no more desire because what was it? Then once he was freed, look how practical the Guru is to the student. The Guru says now &ldquo;Here is some medicine, you need cleaning up, even you have to have inner clean too you know for your body.&rdquo; This is what you have, mental inner clean, we need physical inner clean. Audience: Well Adano the Masters say to organize your weaknesses, to see what your weaknesses are, okay this isn&rsquo;t to say then &ldquo;Go ahead and fulfill all those desires and get them out of way but rather to know what your grappling with? Adano: All right, explain yourself. Audience: Well in other words you said you can&rsquo;t run away from what has brought you back into this body to fulfill those desires from past lives but yet you can work off that karma without going ahead and committing those deeds  particularly. Adano: Now here is a particular statement, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; Meaning &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I&rsquo;ll not send forth a thousand and two times.&rdquo; That second time could be the thousandth and two times for you, you don&rsquo;t know how many times you come back here to fulfill a desire but this statement is made by a great Master, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send for a second time&rdquo; but the second time can indicate a hundred and two time or a thousand and two time or a million and two times. Audience: Well doesn&rsquo;t this mean the fact that Divinity has overcome, then no longer does he have to come back. Adano: &ldquo;Therefore I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord,,&rdquo; the next statement is indicative of freedom, it&rsquo;s indicative of the liberation. You see, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time.&rdquo; This is indicative of reincarnating, a second time automatically is indicating it. Why you need a second time if you are don&rsquo;t overcome it? If you overcome it, you don&rsquo;t need it. If this is your first time in this body, let&rsquo;s be realistic now, do you really know honestly what you have to overcome in terms of behavior with your fellow Man? We don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;re all trying to adjust in relationship and this is a process so if this is in the Christian scriptures, it is not in the Eastern scriptures where you are gonna go and say now Eastern thinking has nothing to do with it, this is strictly Christian writings. Therefore the Christian writing is stating without any doubt that the process of overcoming is based upon enough opportunities to overcome. 2:10 Otherwise it would not agree with, &ldquo;As you sow that you reap.&rdquo; if you don&rsquo;t have something to sow, you can&rsquo;t reap it and if you don&rsquo;t reap it, you got to wait for another opportunity to reap it. So Master Jesus is pretty aware of the truth, he knew of a definite science so he&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I&rsquo;ll not send forth a second time&rdquo; so this has to do with unfulfilled desires, it has to do with behavior. Now &ldquo;but to him that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; To him that don&rsquo;t overcome it, you have to go forth the second time but if you can make it now in this present conscious state, if you can realize that you can do it here now with the help of meditation, with the help of Masters, and you can make the grade, then you will not have to repeat the process, then you will become a pillar, what is a pillar? It&rsquo;s a fixture, &ldquo;in the house of my Lord&rdquo; so we say you go from reincarnating now to resurrection. Now who have read the Autobiography of a Yogi? I once read Jesus you know and they told me he resurrected from the dead then I read of a certain Shakespearean writing that nobody comes back from the grave to tell you what happens on the other side, I says I can&rsquo;t believe that because deep down something tells me Man survives his decent burial if he can make the grade. Now if Jesus made it, I waited many years as a boy to come and read the truth, you know an autobiography of a man who passed away in 1936 resurrected back to his student and spoke to the student, Sri Yukteswar, the same Sri Yukteswar who has so much love, lived in India, didn&rsquo;t even know us, we were just a gleam in Mama&rsquo;s eye or Papa&rsquo;s eye, here we are repeating his knowledge. He had love for us that he had somebody to come to this part of the world to teach us a science and he resurrects and tell his Beloved Disciple that there is a definite realm behind there. Now if the Master Jesus said there was, let&rsquo;s see what he said, &ldquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house there are many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you. If it were not so, I would tell you.&rdquo; So this &ldquo;many mansions,&rdquo; a mansion is a structure, it&rsquo;s a building. Now I don&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s a building, there are levels of creation we&rsquo;re talking of now, it&rsquo;s only symbolic. Now &ldquo;To him that overcometh I will not send forth a second time but I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; That means a man can resurrect himself, this is the science of the Soul, this is liberation, this is what all the Saints have been talking for thousands of years, nothing new, it&rsquo;s never being changed, it&rsquo;ll always be with us and science one day will come along says, &ldquo;Yes we do survive our decent burials.&rdquo; &ldquo;But to him that overcometh,&rdquo; to him that let go of the desire pattern you see that&rsquo;s the thing. Audience: I&rsquo;m still confused (inaudible). Adano: See we are using symbolism Myrtle, &ldquo;to kill out desire,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s take it literally and let&rsquo;s take it metaphysically. First desire is craving for experience. Audience: Where does the craving come from? Adano: It comes from exposure to the five senses. Now once the five senses are exposed to some object, there is a craving for experience but that craving for experience demands a certain loss of energy, you cannot have an experience without a loss of energy, this is a natural law as much as it&rsquo;s physics, physics, physics. You have to give up some form of energy for that experience, you have to pay the price for that experience and when you pay the price then you realize was it worth it? Was the experience worth it to make that effort? Now let&rsquo;s say the experience is worth it then this desire can now develop into an addiction, as you keep repeating the process or the craving for that experience, it&rsquo;s like a plant that has a fruit and the fruit has seeds and the seeds keep sprouting again and again to produce the same fruit. In order to experience the same experience over and over, the seeds of desire come forward, the loss of energy come forward. Now the man who has exposed himself constantly to the tremendous desires of his environment, you&rsquo;ll notice three basic things about him: there is no peace, his body is starting to degenerate quicker than the others, and third he&rsquo;s already willing to commit hari-kari, he wants to die and leave the scene, he&rsquo;s fed up. These are three things: he&rsquo;s bored, there&rsquo;s nothing here now to impress him because he&rsquo;s so saturated with his desires that it makes him now an egotist. He has lost all sense of respect for life, he can afford it so why not take it? Why afford it, why not just take it. Our desire patterns lead us that way to our own self-destruction. Now when I they say &ldquo;kill out desire,&rdquo; it isn&rsquo;t that you should not experience, we are here to experience, that is true but there is a certain way to experience without the use of one&rsquo;s ego. We can experience everything in this universe by the will of God, yet at the same time we can experience everything by our own personal ego. You have a wish for a certain object and in your pocketbook you have the money and there&rsquo;s a next person next you don&rsquo;t have that money and they have that wish, just as sincere as yours, you can go up to the store and buy it right away and fulfill your wish, that is an act of ego, not an act of divine will yet. That person may want that thing and that person realizing they can&rsquo;t have it right away, they forget about it and take what is the most practical way and then five years after, somebody comes to visit them and brings them a present and it&rsquo;s that thing but they had already forgotten about that thing, they didn&rsquo;t even want it no more. The thing is still going to materialize in their life, the desire must be fulfilled. Audience: Are you to be completely without ego, to overcome ego completely? Adano: In the Divine Will there is no ego, our ego gets a chance to inflate itself by super abundance. That&rsquo;s why Masters when they have the super abundance, take the vows of renunciation and accept the vows of poverty and chastity because they know what super abundance can do to them, you see. They will not forfeit their spirituality for ego, they will always learn to live by humility and Divine Will so if they have abundance like a king, take we have King Janaka, the tremendous abundance and yet he took the vows of renunciation. We have King Ashoka and yet he took the vow of renunciation. When you have, I know of a certain man who lived in this country, a  very multi-millionaire, very very wealthy, there was nothing that he couldn&rsquo;t afford and he was a disciple of the Master Yogananda and Master Yogananda used to hem and patch that man&rsquo;s underwear for him and his socks and his shirt. 2:20 Now the Master is doing it for the disciple, this has happened here in this country to show that this man had no ego yet owning a tremendous industrial complex and his Guru is doing such things for him and the Guru is saying &ldquo;In this man there is no guile, there is no ego with all his money.&rdquo; Yet anything this man would think of and a funny thing, I&rsquo;m going to tell you some instance with it to show you that ego versus divine will. Bakersfield California is noted for oil, there is a farm there where no one, all the big industrial people checked for oil, there&rsquo;s no oil there. So a farmer had a piece of land there and he figured &ldquo;Well nobody&rsquo;s gonna want this piece of land so whoever wants it, he&rsquo;ll just sell it.&rdquo; So this disciple, this same disciple of the Master came along driving one day and he saw it and he said to the Master, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to buy this land and give this old man a chance to get out from under this area&rdquo; so Master said, &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; He paid the man what the man wanted and the man was so happy, got out of the area. Then he said to the Master he says, &ldquo;Now we bought something that has no value&rdquo; because it been surveyed by all the big brains for oil and the Master says &ldquo;No dig an extra thousand feet and you&rsquo;ll hit the best gushers in the country&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. They dug wells, the first one a thousand feet deeper (gushing sound), it was a gusher and you know there&rsquo;s not a single pumper on the piece of land that he owned. Then everybody started to&hellip; but it&rsquo;s too late, he already bought up the land. The man who owned the land wanted it back, it&rsquo;s too late. He had dug deeper and every well came up as a gusher, this was divine will, there&rsquo;s no ego involved in the thing. Equally true when an orchard that he had, there is an old Japanese fellow who&rsquo;s struggling all his life to eke out a livelidhood and so he wanted to buy the thing out and gave the man any price to help the man and the man after he&rsquo;s bought the thing, the man says, &ldquo;Could I work for you.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; put the man to work back in the same place and he became the Godfather of the man&rsquo;s children and when he was about to pass away, he turns around and wills the thing back to the man and the man now has a very very prosperous orchard, for the first time he has gotten from his working because the man was willing to sacrifice the thing for what he could get, here&rsquo;s someone bought it out of compassion, at the same time tried to be so good to him and turns around and gives it back. I&rsquo;m trying to show that divine will works in a strange way versus ego will in our desires. We have desires because we are in the body, we cannot kill it out, we cannot uproot them. The Master says it&rsquo;s impossible because you have not experienced them but there is a way to experience them by the ego will or by the divine will and I&rsquo;ll show you something. Before Master passed out of the body, he always mentioned to his disciples about the beautiful green big coconuts that grow in India, you ever seen them Ike? Those big coconuts with the little jelly inside, the biggest type, green coconut. That was his favorite, he&rsquo;d been to India back in 1936, he came back and he was always talking about it, never craving for it, he was just talking about what the coconuts would be. Two days before he&rsquo;s gonna have his Mahasamadhi there are four cases delivered to the ashram so he comes out and asks who the cases are for, it&rsquo;s for the Master. So they pry the box open, green coconuts from India, can you beat that? So he says, &ldquo;See how Divine Mother fulfills each little wish without you going out and buying the thing or hitting somebody on the head, &lsquo;please ship me some boxes of coconuts.&rsquo;&rdquo; See what I&rsquo;m trying to point out, Ananda Moi, you&rsquo;ve met him? Through that experience Ananda Moi learned now for the first time the difference between ego will and divine will. I don&rsquo;t know if he ever told you the story about the fountain pen, you ever heard the story of the fountain pen? That was the thing, now he had a pen and it was leaking so badly yet he wouldn&rsquo;t go out and buy a pen, he had money to buy the pen but he still kept on working with that old pen and then one day he expressed the desire for a pen, he showed the ego will. No sooner than he expressed the desire, somebody gave him a pen, then along came three people who gave him some pens so he had more pens than he could handle, everybody kept bringing him a pen then he realized what the ego will and divine will is. Audience: When you meditate everyday are you burning up desire (inaudible)? Adano: When we meditate, do not meditate like the Gentiles. You know Jesus was very smart, &ldquo;Do not pray like the Gentiles because they always pray for something.&rdquo; Gentiles don&rsquo;t mean non-Jew you know, &ldquo;Do not pray like people who have no comprehension of themselves, they are humble in their own way but still they are lacking comprehension.&rdquo; They are constantly so lamb-like that they don&rsquo;t want (inaudible), they always want something so their whole prayer is &ldquo;God give me this, give me this, give me this, give me this.&rdquo; Now Jesus is saying, &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you and all these things will be added unto you.&rdquo; Learn to realize the divinity within yourself first and how it functions within you and all these things, which are only thought expressions or only desire, different forms of desires, physical things, &ldquo;I want a car, I want a house, I want a new suit&rdquo; these are only a physical things, look how much effort you have to put in for prayer to get that when you can have joy and spiritual consciousness which attracts and draws these things to you, that&rsquo;s why he said &ldquo;these things will be added unto you.&rdquo; Audience: No but I mean if you don&rsquo;t want them, I mean if you don&rsquo;t want to have to go through&hellip; Adano: Alright, this house, here is an example of this house. Louise did not want to sell the house to the man who first came to buy it, you know that. &ldquo;I will never sell to this man, why? I&rsquo;m going to sell my house for what?&rdquo; And she kept saying that all the time, &ldquo;I was not gonna sell it,&rdquo; who ends up buying the house? Because the price he was offering was not the price she wanted in the first place and so she kept on saying, &ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not going to sell, no I&rsquo;m not going to sell&rdquo; and what happened? The man comes back and offers her the price she wants and she sells, see what I mean? Got the price she wanted and then she sold it. The psychology of it is this, that you must set up a thought and see its action take place in yourself and that is what she did. By saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; the action moved to fulfill it. Now God is smart, in the Garden of Eden He wanted Adam and Eve to eat that fruit because that would set the whole process of creation going by telling them &ldquo;don&rsquo;t eat it.&rdquo; If He had said, &ldquo;Go ahead, eat the thing&rdquo; do you think anybody would eat it? (Laughter) This is the principle. If she said &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;ll sell the house to the man at a loss,&rdquo; you think she&rsquo;d be happy? By saying she don&rsquo;t want to sell the thing, she got what she wanted, it made the man more interested to buy the house. This is a principle we don&rsquo;t realize how it works but the more we understand it, the more we realize when you say you don&rsquo;t want to do something, rest assured you&rsquo;re gonna to be doing it. This is a natural law, why? Because the moment you say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do a thing,&rdquo; everything around you is going to force you to make you want to do it, everything starts coming in then, everything starts closing in on you. 2:30 The moment you says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to do something,&rdquo; it stops, that&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s what you call the centrifugal and centripetal force of consciousness. You set up an ID and it sets these forces in motion. Now take for instance, you have a thought and the whole universe is consciousness, it&rsquo;s not a person sitting on a throne to answer you, its consciousness. It&rsquo;s like the ground, you put the seed in and the seed has to die in order to be born to grow, you plant the thought you have to forget it in order for it to materialize and manifest itself. Masters when they plant a thought in consciousness they don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Lord are you going to open it up and do it for me?&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re going to do it, maybe you&rsquo;re not going to do it.&rdquo; They know like Jesus&rsquo;s says, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and the wind stops, &ldquo;take up your bed and walk,&rdquo; these were specific statements without doubt because their consciousness is attuned, their consciousness is heightened to that level already, there isn&rsquo;t something that they are fighting within themselves that maybe or maybe it&rsquo;ll work, there&rsquo;s no such thing going on in the spiritual person&rsquo;s consciousness. The first lesson in spirituality is not to doubt, the first lesson again is obedience, to obey your inner self and when you obey your inner self you don&rsquo;t doubt no more so &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God which is within you,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s obedience, that&rsquo;s the first thing. Now Yogananda came along and says &ldquo;Everything else can wait but the search for God can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; he puts it in his way you see. What you&rsquo;re trying to realize is that you must have a desire, we cannot live without desires but the greatest desire is God-realization where all desires funnel in themselves and become this one desire, they become this one dynamic impetus, this one dynamic force that attracts and pulls to you what you need, not what you want. Now Jesus says &ldquo;All your needs will be fulfilled,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t say all your wants are gonna be fulfilled and I don&rsquo;t know of any Master who will tell you your wants are going to be fulfilled, your needs are going to be fulfilled so your need grows in proportion to your consciousness and if you&rsquo;ve got three children, the needs are great, if you got one child the need is in proportion so this is again a consciousness, you follow me? So the greater need is God so if you have God as the greatest need, is there anything you can be without? Don&rsquo;t you see you have everything coming to you by natural law now for the first time, you realize how easy it is to have this principle flow into your life? The more you decide that &ldquo;I want you God, I love you,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;I got nothing else to tell you but that I love you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now if you don&rsquo;t accept my love, you don&rsquo;t want my love, all right that&rsquo;s up to you, I still love you just the same.&rdquo; You think the Father, the inner consciousness, is going to refuse you love? He can&rsquo;t, he is trapped by love. You know a certain man said, &ldquo;At the feet of foolish men, place all the gifts of the world, material creation, but on my head pour the sweet waters of serenity, give me the peace of mind.&rdquo; Now once you have this inner peace, this inner mind, I don&rsquo;t know wherein of any individual, I&rsquo;m not gonna talk of Masters now, I&rsquo;m gonna talk of myself, where material things do not manifest in our lives. I&rsquo;ve seen this happen over and over without even craving for something, it just comes into my life and falls there and I know this is added to me, I didn&rsquo;t go out and look for it. I&rsquo;m trying to obey a principle, it&rsquo;s a principle that is universal, it has no relationship with any human beings as the creator of it, no human being created this principle, this principle works within us. The principle is to look inside for the inner light, which means to seek the kingdom of God within you or which means &ldquo;Be thou still and know that I am God&rdquo; or it also means recognizing my inner divinity. With this attitude to this principle I know by the natural law of mutual attraction what is best for this mechanism will be forthcoming all the time and those who have meditated and experienced this, they can vouch for it. Now where is the need for craving, where is the need for desire? Sometimes you&rsquo;re pleasantly surprised by your friends when you think you have nothing, along comes more than you anticipate, isn&rsquo;t that divinity working for you too by love? Now all that the great Master asked us to do and all the Masters, love this Creative Intelligence, love this Principle with all your heart, all your mind and Soul, your whole beings just wants to love for the first time. Now I don&rsquo;t mean the word love from your mouth, love that transcends words, love that leads you to feelings, like a bubble ready to burst into the ocean and become one with it, just feel it flowing, all your whole being and your neighbor as yourself because there&rsquo;s nothing else but you and this love. There are no words, you just want this whole thing to come down into you and every time you go in like a wave you want it because there is nothing else but it, there is no words there for you but this feeling and this is what the Masters are trying to tell us because with this love coming down, you are king, you are Saint, you&rsquo;re not a beggar, you&rsquo;re a true son of God for the first time. A king would not give his kingdom to a beggar, he would give it to his son and you are all radiant sons of this Cosmic Light because it&rsquo;s enough but we have to enter it, we have to want it so much that it aches and sometimes it comes down you wanna cry, there are no ways to stop this pain, it&rsquo;s not a pain of sorrow, it&rsquo;s a aching of knowing that you&rsquo;re ready to burst out with so much feeling for the first time, you look at everything and everything has texture for the first time, it&rsquo;s dynamic, it&rsquo;s vibrating, it&rsquo;s scintillating, you want to merge into it and yet at the same time you seem to stand aloof, serenely anchored in yourself. We don&rsquo;t know why, everybody seems to be a part of you, it&rsquo;s so much tenderness is flowing for the first time, to really touch someone for the first time and it&rsquo;s like electrical sparks, scintillating and you know Master used to be in deep states of Samadhi and come out and one of the sisters said to him, &ldquo;Master you look radiant, you look so blissful.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I wish I could share it with you how much Godness is pouring in but your little cup can&rsquo;t take it, so meditate.&rdquo; In other words we have to go in, don&rsquo;t fight it with words, meditation has nothing to do with adjectives, pronouns, verbs, and nouns, it has to do with feeling. If you&rsquo;re gonna sit down and mathematically figure out God in your brain and expect to realize him, it can take a dictionary and sit down the whole day and study it, you&rsquo;ll never get anything. Some scientist says to Sri Yukteswar he hasn&rsquo;t proven God in the lab yet so Sri Yukteswar says to him, &ldquo;Well you figure out in your brain in the next 24 hours what He is not and then you&rsquo;ll discover what He is.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d have to empty out every verb, every pronoun, every adjective out of that brain of his to experience so even in Master Jesus, after all the commandments given by Moses, he still put the commandment of Bhakti, devotion, above it, &ldquo;Love the Lord thy God with all your mind, heart, and Soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; Now two things equal to the same thing are themselves equal to one another, the love in you of God is to discover yourself, the love in your neighbor as yourself is the same God, so the God in him and the God in me are one so how can I hit him on the head, should I not turn the jaw when he hits me on this side? And I don&rsquo;t think he would want to hit me first so there can be no friction between two people if there is love. Realizing this unity, this is what Einstein is talking about today, mathematically calling it unified field theory we&rsquo;re living in a unified force, there is no coming to an end, there is no beginning, it&rsquo;s all consciousness. So Master Yogananda says there are two distinct ways to enter into this consciousness, one by a step-by-step process of scientific union through yoga or the second way is by pure devotion, love, but since we live in an industrial society, we don&rsquo;t have this tremendous devotion for God, it&rsquo;s not so easy to develop this devotion to God so we are going to need a step-by-step process. Now, so Babaji sent Yogananda to the West with the technique of a step by step process which is called Kriya Yoga. Master came and showed both techniques, the technique of Kriya and the technique of devotion, the technique of devotion is Kirtan, the chanting, the Japa, the repetition of the Holy Name. Once this is done, what are you doing in a chanting in a Kirtan? Here is cream, you don&rsquo;t see butter out of it but give you the ladle. Let&rsquo;s say the cream represents your consciousness, you don&rsquo;t see God in you yet. Well here is the ladle, here is the Kirtan, here is the Japa, here is the mantra, churn, you start grinding and don&rsquo;t stop and before you know if you have what? Butter, you have God Consciousness, devotion does them, that&rsquo;s what Jesus brought, Bhakti, you can do it. &ldquo;The things I have done, you can do, and greater things you shall do,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s said, not lesser things, greater things because we are living in a different age, we&rsquo;re living in a different dimension of thinking and need so this devotion can come about, it can produce this divine wisdom, this divine love and Master came along he said fifty percent of the job is done by just that alone and the other 50% is done by God because if you keep turning cream you don&rsquo;t see the subtle action that is causing that cream to change into butter but you know that you have ground it up there with your elbows because you&rsquo;re pretty weary after a while, that&rsquo;s the fifty percent action. Well how did this get together and turn into this butter is still a miracle to your eyes, then you have to go into chemistry and observe what takes place. The same thing with consciousness, God realization can be achieved in this lifespan by one of two methods: step-by-step scientific technique of yoga where you draw the vital energy through the endocrine system to the top of the skull and by the principle of hot and cold you change the molecular structure of this body back into pure consciousness, the techniques are taught by Self Realization Fellowship but Master says that is for people who don&rsquo;t have devotion, they need that. Now if you have devotion plus that, you&rsquo;re even better but if you can start off with devotion you are there already. Before we go into a little meditation, I want to mention a person that I know very much of devotion. I met her a years ago and she read the Autobiography of a Yogi, she never knew anything about anything else, she never was interested in anything else, she never wanted to know anything more about Kriya Yoga and other science of anything else, all she did was to say a little prayer over and over and over and over and one day lo and behold all the five Masters came walking through he house and she sees them every day so she thought she was going nuts, she thought she was having hallucinations or something so she spends her money and calls SRF and talks to Sister Daya Mata in California Edison. Sister Daya Mata who is head of the organization answered and cross-questioned the woman for hours on the phone and you know what was the answer she said to the woman? &ldquo;You have no hallucinations, your devotion is so great that you are seeing these Masters, continue as you are. It would be an insult to learn the Kriya Yoga technique to God.&rdquo; It would be an insult now to go back and try to learn formalities or learn the mechanics. If you got this devotion so far, now you remember in the Autobiography? There&rsquo;s a certain mountain where three hermits live and they used to pray to God, they only had one prayer, &ldquo;Thou art three, we are three, have mercy on us&rdquo; and all of a sudden the local bishop heard about it and he decided he&rsquo;s going to go and teach these people how to pray because that&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous to pray like that. So he paddles with his boat across the river, goes up to the mountain, he sees these three people, they&rsquo;re old you know. All they were praying &ldquo;Thou art three, we are three, have mercy on us.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;My children, that&rsquo;s not the way to pray, here&rsquo;s the way,&rdquo; long series of prayers and everything, Our Father&rsquo;s, Hail Mary&rsquo;s, and all these different&hellip; So he left them and he&rsquo;s in the boat and he&rsquo;s halfway across the river now, all of a sudden he sees a light coming along the river and the light stops right in front of him and in the light these three hermits are holding hands saying, &ldquo;Please Father, would you teach us those prayers that you taught us? We forgot it all&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s looking at them and they&rsquo;re standing in the water, they&rsquo;re right on top of the water, foot&rsquo;s not even touching the water. He says &ldquo;My children continue with your prayer.&rdquo; (Laughter). See what devotion is now? The technique is for people who don&rsquo;t have devotion but devotion can get you there faster, this is all. Let&rsquo;s have a little meditation. 1:50 Now for those who don&rsquo;t know what meditation is and it&rsquo;s something new to them, let me clear your mind up. Meditation is not new, in fact it&rsquo;s right in the Christian scriptures, Jesus used to teach it all the time&hellip; (Gap in tape). (Group chants &ldquo;Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om&rdquo; several times). (Group chants &ldquo;He Bhagavan&rdquo; several times). (Group chants &ldquo;Listen listen listen to my heart song. Listen listen listen to my heart song. I will never forget Thee, I will never forsake Thee. I will never forget Thee, I will never forsake Thee.&rdquo; several times).</p>
<h2 id="1969-april-26---part-1-dallas">1969 April 26 - Part 1 Dallas</h2>
<p>Adano69_04_26_1DallasQ2RRNW6 - &hellip; because why? Not enough meditation before it, not enough one pointedness, you see. That&rsquo;s why you need Hong-Sau and all those other techniques to develop one pointedness. You see self-realization comes before God realization. God realization is the final cap, just like tapering off of the whole thing but you have to work at self-realization on yourself to develop concentration, develop interiorization in order to bring your mind at one pointedness that you can listen to the higher self. The thing is through the repetition of the holy names you do slow off the pull of the five senses so you gradually develop one pointedness after. The one advantage is that Master has granted his blessing and that means you&rsquo;ve got five incarnations of karma taken off already, this is the credit they give you, you see, that you don&rsquo;t have to work out five incarnations of karma after they extend you this credit. Now if you&rsquo;re broke and you need credit somebody&rsquo;s going to vouch for you right and you have to work to pay it off and the spiritual Master grants you this spiritual credit for five incarnations and this is the advantage of being prepared before initiation because then it comes (inaudible), the momentum builds up. So you haven&rsquo;t lost anything, in fact by the exposure before and then taking initiation you&rsquo;ve gained something, that&rsquo;s why they say no one is in a rush to take initiation right away because no one really knows what they&rsquo;re getting into in initiation, the preparation is important. It&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t write a book unless you know the alphabet in order to construct languages, sentences, and so forth and then you sit down and write something, it&rsquo;s the same way with cosmic consciousness. You can&rsquo;t go fully into it unless you have made the necessary preparations in consciousness but the little exposure you&rsquo;ve have prior to initiation has given you a boost. Now with the help of the Master since he&rsquo;s assumed that responsibility to see you through to the end, see this is an unbroken love, that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s called the Godfather. You know we have God parents when we are baptized in churches but they don&rsquo;t mean anything to us, the real Godfather is the person who assumes to see that you return back to God in this incarnation or in all the incarnations but preparation is necessary. (Inaudible). See the all the Masters are in the one consciousness, all the disciples are linked to it, it&rsquo;s only the disciple who thinks they are distinct and separate gets carried away but the disciple who realizes that all the Masters are one with God, he becomes a channel for any Master to grant a Darshan to his disciples no matter where he is, Charan Singh&rsquo;s disciples too, grant them Darshan. So the thing is this, all you are learning right now is preparation for initiation, see initiation is a very very sacred bond in fact very little of it has been known in the West about it, it has been called baptism by the Christian faith when John the Baptist was baptizing you know, by water. Now initiation goes beyond baptism, John the Baptist baptized people with water when he was alive but he never baptized with the spirit that is he never did initiate by the spirit in the body of John the Baptist. Prior to the body of John the Baptist in the previous incarnation he did initiate in the spirit as a Guru that lived before. He was Elijah in a previous incarnation and his disciple was Elias and his disciple was not fully realized and his disciples said to him, &ldquo;Would you grant me a double portion of your spirit?&rdquo; In other words would you take me up the Sat Lok or Sach Khand right to the final end of cosmic consciousness where the unmanifest God is and Elijah said, &ldquo;You ask a hard thing because I worked for mine, you ain&rsquo;t working for yours. You&rsquo;re begging for something, you want it too easy.&rdquo; But you can pull a Master through his nose by love, every devotee of God is a victim of love, he cannot refuse you, it&rsquo;s too much love. The moment you generate some love for him, he gives you the universe of God right away, you&rsquo;re bound to get the thing. So he said, &ldquo;All right, if you see me before I pass on it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; This is the love, this is the compassion, the mantle you know, not the piece of cloth on his head, &ldquo;this cosmic consciousness is yours now, this experience is yours&rdquo; and he did see him before he passed out to the body and he granted it to him. Now, but that is what we call he became an ascended Master, he was not a manifested Master, he was not commissioned by God to come into the body to teach truth whereas Elijah was commissioned by God to teach truth to Elias but Elias achieved this now through the grace of this teacher so he has to come back now as a manifested Master. So he came back in the body of Jesus and when he was in the body of Jesus he said &ldquo;Elijah has come and they know him not,&rdquo; the roles were reversed now. John the Baptist was Elijah, the Guru came back a second time to fulfill the role, not to initiate now as before but just wait for the moment when his disciple. You see the Guru / disciple relationship is never broken in life and death is never broken, he&rsquo;ll follow you like a mother bird all through your life so it had to come back, they had to be born again now just to fulfill this role. So John the Baptist came before Jesus, &ldquo;crying in the wilderness,&rdquo; the wilderness of five senses, the wilderness of sense limitation and when Jesus came to him&hellip; interesting huh? Why did he not go to some other prophet living at that time and why would he proclaim that Elijah had come and the people knew him not, they were looking for Elijah to come back but here was Elijah but they couldn&rsquo;t recognize him because their five senses were limited, they did not have the perception or the intuition to perceive a God Man standing in their midst. 0:10 Now he had the perception, he went to John then starts the big argument, &ldquo;You baptized me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no you baptized me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no you baptized me,&rdquo; &ldquo;No you baptizing me,&rdquo; this is a big argument between the two. Well imagine two grown guys talking about baptism, one says &ldquo;you do it,&rdquo; &ldquo;You do it,&rdquo; and the other is saying, &ldquo;I baptize you with water but there cometh one after me who will baptize you with the Spirit whose shoes I&rsquo;m not even worthy to tie.&rdquo; Where does the worthiness or the unworthiness comes in? Only because the rules are reversed now, his Guru had to see him go to the highest state of development, he had to bring him up there by bestowing the grace in previous incarnation, he has to be there to see him ushered in now by divine law, God commanding this disciple now to go back into the world among the Jewish people as a manifested Master, born and whose birth is predicted before birth, that&rsquo;s what a manifested Master&rsquo;s life is. He&rsquo;s never born unknown, he&rsquo;s always born known by others of the same caliber of consciousness, he&rsquo;s always predicted before he&rsquo;s born, and the roles of the Guru must be there to usher him back, must give him the keys back. You see because it&rsquo;s a human mechanism, God is in Man, Emmanuel, God is with us all the time in the human body not somewhere remote in a throne, He is your conscious life here with you now. So John baptized with water admitting for the time that he was no longer a Guru, no longer a manifested Master, he was here to set the new manifested Master in motion, to turn over the role of a Guruship for the new age of that period, Jesus came to him. Now all the time he baptized many people but did not initiate them, when Jesus came and the tussel between between who should do this initiation now, since both men are equal now, you see, and Jesus says &ldquo;No you baptize me because this is the way of righteousness.&rdquo; That statement is very important, the disciple must always respect the Guru&rsquo;s position regardless if the rules are reversed in any incarnation, it&rsquo;s the Guru who brought them there because the Guru is God already and this is the way of true thinking, right thinking, right law you see. So the disciple had to admit the honor due to the spiritual Master who was fully illumined at one time and only assumed this unassuming role as a herald or a sort of a broadcast of truth now, he&rsquo;s taken on a different role now, he doesn&rsquo;t come back as a Guru to initiate now so the disciple is recognizing this role, this change in role but he&rsquo;s still saying &ldquo;No you baptize because this is the way of righteousness,&rdquo; this is the respect, this is always the respect. As in Lahiri Mahasaya and Babaji, it is still Babaji who initiated Lahiri although Lahiri was a manifested Master now in this incarnation but this role is accepted you see. Now when he accepted the responsibility of initiating his disciple again, not baptizing him now, as soon as he touched him on the forehead there was the sound like rushing of waters, the audible life stream, he heard it clear right in the right ear and he heard the various highest sounds within the audible life stream and then he saw the dove which is the five-pointed star inverted descending now, that light coming down within himself. Now he&rsquo;s seeing it, the person who wrote it was not present so somebody had to tell the author of that particular literature what occurred. See most people never realized when they read that, &ldquo;Lo the voice of God from heaven came out&rdquo; and says &ldquo;like a dove descending, this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.&rdquo; But who wrote that? Certainly not Jesus. Well let&rsquo;s see if that person was present, where was that person? If he was present then he was a student of John the Baptist and if he was a student of John the Baptist he was preparing his consciousness for such an experience and if it happened in this one disciple that has been initiated by his Guru now, then his spiritual eye opened for a brief moment to see it and his inner ear opened to hear it, you see. So that way he had what is called a jump in consciousness, his consciousness expanded for that moment from the overflow of the initiation. This does happen when someone initiates and there are a few people in the room, that person who is being initiated what inner experiences they are experiencing can be perceived and be picked up as an overflow. Now he was initiated and he saw this inner light descending in him and he heard this sound and the voice saying &ldquo;This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo; Well it doesn&rsquo;t mean this is Jesus Christ, my only son in whom I&rsquo;m well pleased because the moment you are initiated, realizing that the Guru is God in flesh who is granting you liberation, who is assuming your karma for five incarnations, he&rsquo;s recognizing the sun S-U-N, the cosmic light in you that he&rsquo;s well pleased to assume the responsibility now. So you have automatically had your second birth &ldquo;Unless you be born again, thou canst not enter into the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; but Nicodemus thought he had to go back in the mother&rsquo;s womb to do it, this is birth of consciousness, not birth of flesh. When the consciousness is open, there is light, it&rsquo;s an s-u-n, not an s-o-n, it is this light, this sun that you&rsquo;re well pleased to perceive all the time, it thrills you all the time when you look into it. This sun is what the Guru wants you to see all the time because this sun he&rsquo;s so immersed in that he wants to give you IT, he wants you to become IT you see but like the Father, which is cosmic light already, and the central sun and if a real sun is going to project itself in an individual thing, you might as well call it an s-u-n too, it&rsquo;s an offspring of the big one so aren&rsquo;t we all sons of light? When we are initiated this is a reality to us, this is what Jesus meant he said &ldquo;When thine eyes are single&rdquo; but there was a word left out because they translated without knowing why that word had to be there, focused, the body is full of light. So he wrote &ldquo;When thine eye is single,&rdquo; when thine eyes are single, the body is full of light. Now this is kind of misleading because it doesn&rsquo;t show you a way to understand what has been written but if you say, &ldquo;When thine eyes are single focused, your whole body is full of light,&rdquo; then this tells you something scientific, at the same time it tells you something cosmic and spiritual but has nothing to do with Churchianity you see. 0:20 So Jesus after he was initiated and he had the inner experience, what did he do? He went to fight with his own ego right? What are you doing? You&rsquo;re going through your Lent, you&rsquo;re going through your mountain now right? This is the process but he came prepared, 18 long years you know from 12 to 32 to 30 he trained himself in all the techniques of concentration and meditation, he did lots of Simran, lots of Bhajan, and lots of Kirtan to bring him to that level that makes it possible to hold on now also he brought Bhakti, lots of love. Now don&rsquo;t do none of those techniques that you&rsquo;ve been given without love, you want to get fast into God, do the love, always do a thing with love, repeat the mantra with love and you will find that you will get results quicker, answered all your questions? (Adano laughs) Not me you know (inaudible) you&rsquo;re just repeating the five names without any connection to the thing right? See you cannot do it without love because it&rsquo;s like Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om, if there&rsquo;s no love in that, it&rsquo;s a dead (inaudible). Now chant it with love. Audience: Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om. All Chanting: Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om. He Bhagavan. He Bhagavan. He Bhagavan. He Bhagavan. (7x) Adano: Heavenly Father / Mother, Beloved Jesus, Masters, Saints and Sages of all religions, bless this meditation, bless each one to see with the spiritual eye the inner light of the Soul dwelling within, free us from darkness, and take us back home to our true home in Sach Khand, Om Shanti Om. 0:30 Mentally repeat without moving the tongue, Radha Soami, Radha Soami means Lord of the Soul. Jesus said, &ldquo;I my Father are one,&rdquo; you can say the same thing too, these mantras develop the consciousness to be focused on God. (Long meditation). 0:40 All Chanting: Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om (5x). (Gap in tape) &hellip; wine of the bottle, one of his greatest verses was &ldquo;I sent my Soul out into the invisible,&rdquo; right here, he had the ability to leave the body at will, &ldquo;a letter of the afterlife to spell,&rdquo; what goes on in and around, &ldquo;by and by my Soul came back and said, I myself am Heaven and Hell.&rdquo; So Radha Soami or the Science of the Soul begins from the big toe and ends at the top of the skull. The whole study of God starts from here all the way up, right up to here, but you don&rsquo;t look here to discover God, you look here all the time at the third eye, here is where the Soul and the mind is connected all the time. Now you don&rsquo;t look down, you&rsquo;re not interested in the centers below the eye, you&rsquo;re only interested in the center above the eye. See the centers below deal with the ganglia, parasympathetic nervous system, and if you&rsquo;re interested in the lesser forms of yoga, physical health and so forth, it&rsquo;s all right but that does not get God realization. God realization begins from here, that&rsquo;s why Jesus said &ldquo;When thine eyes are single,&rdquo; focused, turned in, &ldquo;the whole body is full of light.&rdquo; This is crystallized light: E=mc2, energy equals the mass times the velocity of light squared, this is an atomic result. God has become us, from the unmanifest state He has slowed down to become manifestation, there is no other technique that we could use, very simple but very effective. God has become us, we are not God, He has become us already but we are the result of his projected energy, His untapped reservoir is the unmanifested state, we cannot begin to comprehend the untapped reservoir of God yet. This goes beyond Sach Khand now, this goes beyond Sat Loka, you follow me? That&rsquo;s what they call it Ananda, the unmanifested, scientifically speaking it is the non-vibratory state of consciousness because in that state there is no vibration. In that state there is no vibration, that is the vibrationless state of consciousness, that is where we say God or cosmic consciousness is that pure consciousness that exists in vibration as creation and exists beyond vibration as non-vibratory creation. In the Genesis it said God rested on the seventh day but if in a literal sense He was to rest on the seventh day, this whole universe would collapse. What it really means is out of the total reservoir of pure consciousness unmanifest, a portion went out and became manifest within six cycles of creation and the balance remained as it was, potentially waiting as the unmanifest. 0:50 Now the borderline between manifestation and non-manifestation is where all the Masters are, that is Sat Lok, the eternal existence, the eternal consciousness, the eternal Ananda or bliss. Sat, Chit, Ananda, the point between existence and non-existence, this is the level where the Masters take you and from there on God takes you in, you become the ocean. &ldquo;I am the bubble, make me the sea,&rdquo; the Master cannot make you the sea, God makes you the sea of consciousness, God makes you unmanifest but you don&rsquo;t lose your individuality, you gain your individuality in the unmanifested state of love, you know for sure now that it is right to say in that state &ldquo;I and my Father are one,&rdquo; in that state you can say Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Om with full love, (inaudible) but you need to know that we are all living in vibration, we are all living in a manifested state, and because we live in a manifested state it is very difficult to comprehend the unmanifest. Now here is where the trickery comes in, we are endowed with a mind that plays lots of tricks in the manifested state with us, it makes us want to stay in the manifested state, it makes us want to live in a manifested state and become enslaved in the manifested state, it does not want us to leave this manifested state and go back home. Now the Saints have all said this is not your home, think of it in a bigger dimension, Earth is not my home then where did I come from? Is it possible in some distant past I came from other terrestrial realms, highly endowed with pure consciousness and got stranded here or marooned here in my journey towards other planets? Think of it. Well why not? &ldquo;God made Man in his own image and likeness, male and female create He them,&rdquo; the whole universe is populated with male and female, He didn&rsquo;t say he made Adam and Eve as the only thing you know and that was a going thing at that time you know. Now the creation that we see around us now as science penetrates more into the structure leads us to wonder and think, can the Sages, can the great Saints of the past, even though they are in the body today, be actually telling us the truth? Is it possible that within this brain there are levels that are not tapped? Yes, there are levels that are not tapped and the levels that are not tapped leaves us two choices: to exert your ego to discover it and pay the price or let the Divine Will unfold it for you without any price. Now this is difficult to let the Divine Will unfold it for you without any price, it&rsquo;s more easy for us to get up and do it ourselves you know and exert our ego and pay a price or you may not know what the price may be demanded of us. This is because we have an outward manifestation and an inward manifestation going on at the same time, the outward manifestation is research, experimentation, trial and error, testing, evaluating, condemning, reassessing, re-postulating, but this is geared to a cosmic law called the Wheel of Life, long known by the Sages as the Yugas, no end, no beginning, ascending and descending eternally all the time, so there is no end to evolution, there is no end to creation, it&rsquo;s always rising and falling all the time, it&rsquo;s one big rat race, that&rsquo;s what your Yugas are, they&rsquo;re called the four ages. There&rsquo;s a golden age when Man is God walking on the earth with total God awareness (inaudible) means living on the realms of manifestation, every thought is materialized at will in the golden age yet within the golden age there are blocks of Mankind not beyond the stone age in mentality. You see how imbalanced that can be even in the golden age? We have that today in atomic age, there are blocks of Mankind not even beyond the stone age too. Now the next age is called the silver age when Man is demigod or half God, he&rsquo;s not a full God realized individual, so we have the Gods and the demigods, the demigods they also now and then can manifest their thoughts at will but they are limited, there are certain powers that they cannot do since it is not natural to them. Then comes the next age which you call the bronze age where you have the heroes who intermarry with the demigods and they went to marry with the immortals so the hero period we have and finally we have the last age which is called the priest, iron age, religion goes right down to the priest, it doesn&rsquo;t go any below that, there are what you call the churchianity or the priest craft, custodians of truth without experience, the hero is trying to live truth but must link himself to an immortal heritage which is the demigod. The demigod lives but not fully released and finally there is a God Man, total God Man, these Yugas or these ages go on grinding, this is the outward life. Now let&rsquo;s see in terms of our mechanical science, in the pre-stage there is no mechanical science, everything is wooden or stone, very little metal and if there is metal it&rsquo;s all limited so the concepts are very concrete, crystallized, no understanding of the properties of matter, this will happen in the iron age. No one&rsquo;s life is worth anything, there is no sense of value, there is no sense of discipline, there is no sense of character, there is no sense of ideal, there is no realization of God but yet within that era, within those periods there are God illumined men who must come in the world to bring just a few out of that morass, like a lotus out of the mud above the water to see a light, there&rsquo;s just a few come up so we have our prophets and there we say &ldquo;Lo there was a king who sent out his messengers among the men of the earth and they turned around and slayed them and sent them back,&rdquo; they were invited to a feast, the feast of the divinity, in your concrete age or your iron age. 1:00 Now let&rsquo;s go to the next age which we are approaching into now, we have left the iron age not too long, we are in the cusp of the iron age or what you call Kali Yuga the dark age in which Man and his inhumanity to Man, the whole middle ages is an example of it, this is happening on the outside. Now let&rsquo;s see when the first discovery of something unusual about material substances, the discovery of magnetism, the discovery of electricity by rubbing certain things, these are all very minor discoveries and (inaudible), this is a slow practice but nothing really going on a gigantic scale. We come out of that into the cusp and we see we are in the cusp, we have discovered the atom, the basic foundation of creation, the substance of which we are constructed of, so we are entering now bronze age or Dvapara yet in this age too we must have illumined Masters to lead us out. Now this illumined Master process is an inner working of the opposite what is going on on the outside, they are not concerned with what goes on in the outside, the Masters are concerned with what goes on in the inside with those few caught in those ages or who are going to extricate themselves out of those ages. Going back to God is like a turnstile, the whole mass creation cannot run through turnstile, they all got to go through one at a time and each one has to go through his own deliverance in some age (gap in tape)&hellip; fighting to be awakened in the West, therefore he sent truth to the West so that they may be awakened. Now if he has perceived this, then rest assured that when your consciousness became exposed to this type of thinking you were one that was already stamped, you know not a wandering maverick, you were branded waiting to go back to bar x. In other words the shepherd has come for the sheep, you have to go back, you cannot stray away so you&rsquo;re already perceived so this is the promise, this is the advantage of being perceived in a higher plane to be attracted to this concept. Now a sheep has strayen straight from its flock, it&rsquo;s gonna run into brambles and all kind of burrs, and his whole world is gonna get lots of things, mud and everything, but that doesn&rsquo;t deter the shepherd, he knows deep down that&rsquo;s a sheep and that role is just as valuable, he&rsquo;s gonna clean them up, it&rsquo;s already been branded, got to take it home. So the Souls that are awakening in the West to this higher consciousness are ones who&rsquo;ve got many karma but don&rsquo;t let the karma deter you because there is no Saint without any karma. You first had to have karma to get rid of to become the Saint and Master Jesus said, &ldquo;A Saint is a sinner who just lost all his karma&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s good. Now we don&rsquo;t know too much of the next age because we can only judge back from history but we are entering the Dvapara or the bronze age in which Man is slowly developing his inner abilities to communicate by thought and learning a little of communication through inner sight and we start to see a host of literature about extrasensory perception. This is nothing new, it has been done in the previous centuries all through the ages and you&rsquo;ll find it in every group of mankind there is this phenomenon. At certain times it is strong and at certain times they are weak, we tend to see this phenomena, not this realization or these Siddhi, these forces, dependent upon the cycles or the Yugas, dependent upon astrological constellations not necessarily an outcome of a development, only in a Master, only in a spiritually realized individual, this is an outcome of growth. That&rsquo;s why Jesus says, &ldquo;What it benefit the man to gain the whole world and lose his Soul,&rdquo; but if you seek the kingdom of God which is within you and its righteousness, all these things will be added unto you, I&rsquo;m referring to the extrasensory perceptive qualities now. If you went out hell-bent and exclusively deny yourself in society just to develop extrasensory properties or qualities, in a short while you&rsquo;ll get them, in a short while you&rsquo;ll lose them all, why? Because you&rsquo;ll develop such an inflated ego that you would not even have any moment of peace or joy, you would want to impress and use it. Now when you realize God as the higher consciousness which brings you peace and joy, these things are added unto you, how? As a result of thought, as you think that what will happen, only a man of God realization sees this happening every day as he thinks, it materializes for him, vast difference. If you look at all the miracles of Jesus, it was all a result of thinking, &ldquo;Stop wind, don&rsquo;t sink my friends in the boat.&rdquo; The command is given, the action is complete, &ldquo;Come forth Lazarus, don&rsquo;t lie down in the grave no more, get up and take your bed and walk.&rdquo; Thought in action as a result of spiritual growth in God, not as a result of seeking powers, these are not extrasensory qualities, vast difference. Now this inner growth is what the Masters are working on when they come to take you back to God. They are not concerned with the outward functioning of the Yugas that brings about the extrasensory forces, the extrasensory forces are dependent on this rise and fall. Finally we come into the golden age, well we are in a Yuga coming up now which is Dvapara but then you go on to Treta Yuga where every man speaks and communicates telepathically, clairvoyantly, this is natural by the Yuga itself. This is not a result of growth, this is a result of the Yuga, this is a result of the astrological movement, the earth and all the planets in close proximity to Alpha Centauri. Now that cycle Man is having this brain activity going on, we&rsquo;re seeing manifestations of mutations of different qualities in the human mechanism, different changes in the mechanism, as we get more aware of the atomic powers and its radiation. Now, so certain extrasensory forces are awakened and become active but that is not the result of spiritual growth. Now in Sat Yug but in that same period of Treta, mechanical science has mastered all the laws of magnetism, we know very little of the laws of magnetism today but in that cycle Man will know all the laws of magnetism, he will understand how to manipulate magnetism by thought. Now he&rsquo;d understand how to spin metal to make various objects by his thinking, he will mold metal now by thinking, he will mold objects by thinking, he will learn how to direct the magnetic charge of the brain to mold his environment but that doesn&rsquo;t say he has the ability to materialize thought at will, you follow me? Now here is two objects in a tube, they have certain magnetic impulses, by the power of thought he will try to join them together and they&rsquo;ll fuse. 1:10 That doesn&rsquo;t say he will cause two pieces of object to come together by their own atomic structure, form themselves, and fuse, he will learn these laws as nature provides him to do it then he will get into Sat Yuga or golden age where he will be fully conscious of the spirit now, God in Man. In that age, the Yuga, the forces will give him an ability now to perceive his atomic structure and be able to manifest thought at will, for the first time he&rsquo;ll be doing this possibility of manifesting thought at will. You want something? You generate the thought force and it materializes, this is the ability to materialize your thoughts at will now in that Yuga. Now in that Yuga the only communication between Man is truth because each one is a living example of an atomic principle. Now the Saints are telling us that this is the rightful level of our consciousness and our real home is at that point where consciousness and manifestation, or creation, meet. It&rsquo;s called Sat Lok, the sphere of eternal existence, eternal consciousness, but not eternal pain, bliss because no one wants pain, pain seems to be an unnatural thing to the human body yet pain has something to teach you, pain teaches you patience, it teaches you courage, it teaches you humility, and pain gives you a certain degree of discipline and strength but that&rsquo;s a hard lesson yet true love you can develop these same forces but that is not so easily learned because you take it for granted. If you don&rsquo;t take these things for granted too much, you have to have a little pain now and then, that&rsquo;s why karma or the law of cause and effect or what you sow as you reap comes to prod you, natural as it is, nobody invented it, it&rsquo;s here we just have to learn to live with it. Now Jesus said &ldquo;If you sow tomatoes, you gotta get oranges,&rdquo; right? What you say? Not right? How come? That should be after all, that&rsquo;s a pretty good way to do things. So you sow tomatoes, you get tomatoes, &ldquo;as you sow, that you reap,&rdquo; &ldquo;as you think.&rdquo; Now remember there&rsquo;s a statement &ldquo;As you think in your heart, that is what you are,&rdquo; this is Sat Lok, this is Sat Yuga, this is God realization, at that level thought manifests all the time, it&rsquo;s only at that level they call you God Man. Now the God Man or the Master, this consciousness is there all the time, strange huh? It&rsquo;s very important because in each Yuga or each cycle there are these God Men who will not leave this earth, they will always be here to take you back to that state. One man would ask, &ldquo;How come in certain religions they said &ldquo;I am the only teacher and I am the only son of God so pray to me and therefore all these things will be washed out.&rdquo; Now ask yourself a simple thing, if you have a toothache would you take a dentist who died in 1863 to take it out, if you got a bad tooth? You won&rsquo;t go to such a dentist, you want one who lives in 1969 to take that bad tooth out. Now this is true about realization inside of yourself, you want to know how this light works inside, how this consciousness really gets up in there that they&rsquo;re talking about, you want a living person here in this realm to make this adjustment for you, to show you a technique of how to do it, it&rsquo;s got to be with you. So Masters are always here, Masters are not people who pull you by the nose, Masters are people who are Masters of themselves, they have mastered life but the engineering dynamics of life they have mastered, they know this delicate balance of death and life, they have mastered the science of behavior, which is the science of the Soul. See the Science of the Soul is the only religion of the universe, it&rsquo;s not Christianity, it&rsquo;s not Buddhism, it&rsquo;s not Confucianism, it&rsquo;s not Hinduism, it&rsquo;s not Islam, it&rsquo;s no -ism, it is the doctrine of the Creator that the sons of the creator propound and talk about, it is no new doctrine, it is the very function of creation itself, it is the result we&rsquo;re looking at. We are the result of the Science of the Soul, God is the lord of the Soul, the lord of the Soul must teach you the Science of the Soul, he cannot teach no -ism and every manifestation, every son that comes down, every individual who has this contact with it that comes into the world to talk about it, he is telling you of that same one truth. That&rsquo;s why Jesus when they asked him what did he teach he says, &ldquo;My doctrine is the doctrine of him that sent me,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t say I come to teach Christianity, &ldquo;My teaching is the Science of the Soul,&rdquo; it has no name because it&rsquo;s the science of how you are constructed. You have a physical body, a thousand years ago you could not accept this body as atomic energy, you could not accept this body as an electrical principle, we have just a few limited gadgets today that can penetrate this tissue to see inside, they&rsquo;re called rays, x-rays and so forth, now imagine if the spiritual eye is open where you see right into the very structure of the atom right back to pure consciousness, what are you seeing? You&rsquo;re gonna see every level of creation for the first time, not colors or swirling lights alone, you&rsquo;re seeing each atomic function as it really is mathematically set up, you&rsquo;re seeing where all the chakras are set up in the lower body, you&rsquo;re seeing the electrical anatomy of the body, then you begin to see the ideational anatomy of the body, then you see something else for the first time that you are this whole universe, for the first time you can trigger it without the loss of your will, not depending on external agents to do it, strictly the fact that you have been awakened to a higher consciousness and this consciousness can look down now and take you out and bring you back in, this is an inner experience that comes to the disciples. Now this very word discipline comes in, a disciple learns to discipline his five senses in meditation because meditation is an individualistic process, it&rsquo;s not a dualistic process, I can&rsquo;t do it for you and you can&rsquo;t do it for me, you have to do it for yourself and the old story says you can take the horse to water but you can&rsquo;t make him drink, right? Now calming the mind and looking in may seem boring in the start but it&rsquo;s not boring because there are certain results that come as you get into it. First you don&rsquo;t dictate what has to be opened up in here because the Master has a chant that knocks out all type of dictation to God and this chant is &ldquo;Who is in this temple, who is in this temple? All the doors do open by themselves,&rdquo; that means all the centers open by themselves and &ldquo;all the lights&rdquo; that is the vortices of energies, &ldquo;go on by themselves.&rdquo; Now where is your ego will gonna come in to dictate it now? &ldquo;And darkness like a dark bird flies away.&rdquo; 1:20  You see for the first time this whole body is atomic light, not only see it with the eyes open but you can see it all around the room and everywhere it&rsquo;s going to be flashing in front of you, anywhere you look you&rsquo;ll see it. You&rsquo;re not only seeing the person, you&rsquo;re seeing all the levels of the person, you see all the incarnations, for the first time you&rsquo;re seeing it really and you want to ask yourself &ldquo;where am I&rdquo; but this is what is happening for the first time it&rsquo;s happening because it&rsquo;s been opened, it&rsquo;s revealed by divine will you see, it&rsquo;s being done for you. God loves you so much he wants to give you the whole creation but you know what? We don&rsquo;t want it, I&rsquo;ll tell you a little story why we don&rsquo;t want it. Here&rsquo;s a grandFather here, he&rsquo;s got a beautiful house up in the hill and you&rsquo;re about eight/nine years of age and your mommy and daddy says, &ldquo;Son, grandpa has got something for you, go run up to the house and get it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh who wants to go and see that old grouch, last night he was yapping at everybody and shaking his stick and saw his face, that long beard, why is that, who wants to go up there?&rdquo; &ldquo;You go up there son, go up there he&rsquo;s got something for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; So you walk in and you come along grandpa&rsquo;s house and all around is a beautiful garden, &ldquo;Boy, this garden is so beautiful, all the petals are made of gold, all the seeds are diamonds and rubies, who wants to go and see grandFather here? I better go help myself and fill my pocket&rdquo; and along comes the gardener, &ldquo;Hello sonny boy, what are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m helping myself, my grandFather lives up there.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh you mean that old grouch? Come out and let me show you the garden boy, help yourself to anything you want here.&rdquo; And before you know, you helped yourself to the garden, you never got up to the house, and you and the gardener became good friends and that is as far as you got. Now let&rsquo;s say I take you up another way, &ldquo;Grandson, Sunday your grandfather is up in that house there and that&rsquo;s his garden, there&rsquo;s a message, there&rsquo;s something there for you. You go and get it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; So you&rsquo;re running up, &ldquo;My grandfather&rsquo;s got something for me, I&rsquo;m gonna get it, I&rsquo;m gonna get it, I&rsquo;m gonna get it, I&rsquo;m gonna get, I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it!&rdquo; And you run and run and run and run, you get the door and you bang, you (inaudible) the garden, you don&rsquo;t even see a gardener, you almost knock him over until you hit that door, &ldquo;Grandpa, grandpa you got something for me? I want it!&rdquo; And the door opens, &ldquo;Okay grandson here you are, what do you want?&rdquo; &ldquo;But you told my mother you have something for me, where is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay come on in, here is the key to the house, this is my last will and testament, this house belonged to you, all that&rsquo;s in the garden is yours, and you see this chest here? It&rsquo;s full of gold and things.&rdquo; You opened it up and you see all this beautiful everything is gold, silver,  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all yours grandson.&rdquo; Then you hear the gardener outside, &ldquo;Well I thought I&rsquo;d get my share but here he gives it to his grandson.&rdquo; Now this is what we&rsquo;re trying to find out, where are we going? Are we gonna be like the first grandson or the second grandson? What is our attitude to realization you see? You go in and you bang, knock and it shall be opened. It&rsquo;s a door, you see Jesus a smart man, he said, &ldquo;Knock.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t knock at the window to get inside the house. If this is the temple of God as he calls it, temple of God, this has got to be a house, it&rsquo;s a place where worship is done so he says it&rsquo;s a temple and this is a ten door temple, interesting, there are 10 doors to this temple. Well you can&rsquo;t see the temple, you only can see nine: two, four, six, seven, eight, nine, the temple is right here, you gotta go inside to open that one. That&rsquo;s the same thing as the ten virgins doing the same thing: ten foolish virgins and ten wise virgins, there&rsquo;s ten forces that comes in and goes out of the human body all the time. So when you turn in, you got to knock for that door, be like that second grandson, &ldquo;I want my&hellip; I want what I&rsquo;ve got to get&rdquo; and doors open by themselves. Now, didn&rsquo;t grandfather open door from the inside? You couldn&rsquo;t open the door, it opened from the other side, it&rsquo;s from the other side of life within this mechanism that consciousness is revealed, this is the difference in super consciousness and subconscious experiences. In subconscious experiences Leary with the drug got the whole geography of the subconscious mind but never got the superconscious mind because the superconscious mind is not functioning in this part of the mechanism, it&rsquo;s functioning above this mechanism. Above each one of us this consciousness is exactly two and a half inches over the head, it doesn&rsquo;t get inside, it doesn&rsquo;t come inside until you look in and turn this energy on, then by the grace of the Master you are locked onto it. It&rsquo;s like shooting a satellite into space and sending out another one to go and rendezvous, this is a rendezvousing process. I can&rsquo;t tell you what it is but you can tell what you felt, right? You felt but you don&rsquo;t know what you felt, you felt like a cold chill, like a current, this current is always around you, it is a force that is there that you lock onto. Now the Masters all say that you cannot, no drug is going to hook you to that, this is something that they themselves says, &ldquo;It takes life to hook life to life.&rdquo; It takes another human being whose life that is hooked onto it to make this transference, it takes a battery that is active to charge up one that is stalled, to give it a boosted charge, that&rsquo;s what a Master comes in for, that&rsquo;s what the initiation is, it&rsquo;s a boosted charge to your Soul force, your magnetic mechanism, to allow you now to get into that state. Now this is nothing against Leary and his research, Leary didn&rsquo;t realize where his research was ending so the process repeated itself over and over for him, he didn&rsquo;t get any further outside the realm of his ideas, you cannot go out beyond your subconscious mind if you don&rsquo;t have anything. If you you have a deep freeze here, you only got the sum total of what you put inside of it, you don&rsquo;t have no more what you don&rsquo;t put inside so your subconscious mind only can carry the sum total of what is being stored up in the process of evolution but the super conscious mind has nothing to do with that, the super conscious mind is the totality of life and this is Soul, this is different, this is what Aurobindo refered to &ldquo;It is ever hovering waiting to descend in Man.&rdquo; That is why it is called the descent of the spirit in Man incarnating, coming into the flesh, coming down into the mechanism. Now people who have had an experience of the Holy Spirit will tell you, they feel this thing coming into them and one of the first experience of that is some people they are able to talk in all types of languages, speaking in tongues. Now in the time of Jesus, his disciples on the day of Pentacost they saw a light, like a little candle light shining over their head and descended on them. Well this is there, right above your head two inches two and a half inches waiting to come down into the mechanism, waiting to come through this mechanism. It cannot come down unless there is a connection, that&rsquo;s why he came only to his fellow disciples and he didn&rsquo;t come to save the sins of the world you know and save mankind, he can&rsquo;t, no one man can do it for the whole of the universe, you can only do it for those that are linked to him spiritually and psychically, those are his renunciate disciples who followed him and his householder disciples who lived in their married life or in their homes. Those disciples he came to take back and every age, every century, every moment in time, there&rsquo;s always one or two Masters living all the time and their disciples are always here to bring this knowledge in, to make you aware of it. So there is no new religion, what there is is the experienceable religion, how to experience religion for the first time and how to look at what has been written of religion in a different perspective, you see you&rsquo;re looking at it in a different sense now. 1:30 For instance I said this whole body is full of light, it took many centuries after Jesus and many many Masters who have come and made the same statement to one man called Einstein who actually wrote a formula to validate and state energy is equal to the mass times the velocity of light squared then he came along and proved how to measure the speed of light, this gave us the atomic energy. Now Brother Kriyananda has a song that goes like this, &ldquo;No church can bind him as their own&rdquo; that means God, no church can bind God as their own &ldquo;but every atom is his throne.&rdquo; Think of it, there is no church on this Earth or in all the universes that can bind God as their own and say &ldquo;we have an exclusive patent on God,&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t have, there is no exclusive thing. The only thing that can bring home the truth to us, the science of the Soul, is the atom itself, &ldquo;every atom is his throne&rdquo; but because the very thing we&rsquo;re talking of is cosmic light, cosmic light in its highest state is unmanifest, when it&rsquo;s manifest we see it, &ldquo;let there be light&rdquo; and that was the first act of creation, you see. Now before the light what was there, darkness? No, it was still light but the light wasn&rsquo;t released from it&rsquo;s light source, it was in the unmanifest state, it&rsquo;s in the reservoir of light. Master Yogananda once said, &ldquo;When you meditate and look inside and were you to see the glory of God, one hair on his head has the brilliance of 10 billion suns.&rdquo; Now think of that statement, one hair on the head of this creative intelligence can be compared to the brilliance of 10 billion suns and Oppenheimer just saw one flash of the atomic bomb in the Alamos there and shouted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the brilliance of a thousand suns,&rdquo; right? He quoted the Bhagavad Gita at the moment he saw it, why did he quote the Bhagavad Gita? That the brilliance of God is like a thousand sons but the Master said only one hair in this consciousness, out of the thousand petal lotus of light, one single aspect or light from it has the brilliance of a billion suns. We cannot comprehend with a limited mind that is restricted the vastness of this scientific principle called guardian. God is not a man sitting on a throne like Sri Yukteswar once said, &ldquo;If you expect to find somebody sitting on a throne&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello earth man, at last you&rsquo;ve come, I&rsquo;m glad to see you, I&rsquo;m going to grant you some miracles, go back now that you&rsquo;ve done so many thousands of incarnations and meditation.&rdquo; You see this is our view of God you know but when you realize there&rsquo;s no such thing&hellip; so Yogananda you know he had this experience of cosmic consciousness and he saw all the universes in himself when his teacher touched him on the heart, the breath left him, and he went right out of his body and he saw his entire universe and the joy and everything when he came back. After days of meditation he came to his teacher one day and says &ldquo;Master, will I find God?&rdquo; And his teacher told him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found Him, what do you want? What do you expect, somebody sitting a the throne?&rdquo; You see we don&rsquo;t realize what we&rsquo;re talking of when we use the word God, in English the word God has a connotation of personality and as a singular function. When we speak in Sanskrit or in any Oriental language, we&rsquo;re speaking of totality, the &ldquo;all-ness&rdquo; within things, the &ldquo;all-ness&rdquo; of all things because the &ldquo;all-ness&rdquo; is already total and the total is One but this One is not a mathematical figure, it is a state of &ldquo;at-one-ment&rdquo; in which you must enter, you must bring your limited consciousness to a statement of &ldquo;at-one-ment,&rdquo; to a statement of attunement, to see the totalness and this is done through meditation. Now you will comprehend why meditation is an anagram, otherwise you&rsquo;d never understand why it&rsquo;s an anagram. M stands for mind or mental, E stands for energy, there are only two forces in the universe, mind/energy, and when energy slows down it&rsquo;s matter and when it speeds up it&rsquo;s mind or pure consciousness. Now, but this mind energy is always directing and that means there is no blind universe, we don&rsquo;t live in a blind universe, haphazardly through space, there&rsquo;s always order, there&rsquo;s harmony, and it&rsquo;s directing what? &ldquo;I,&rdquo; individual, that means each individual aspect of creation is being internally self-directed. That means God cannot leave no individual aspect out, God is already within each individual aspect as a self-directing quality, you want to call it conscience? All right, you can use that word but greater than conscience is Soul, Soul force, the link between Man and God, between the body and God so it&rsquo;s a self-directing and individual process, &ldquo;I,&rdquo; but this directing process is moving towards something, it&rsquo;s not moving towards destruction, it&rsquo;s moving towards fulfillment so &ldquo;T&rdquo; is towards, so it&rsquo;s moving individual thought because we can only think and we do that all the time because we are the result of mind and energy, we are the result of thought process so we are thinking. So we have Mental Energy Directing Individual Thought Activities or Thought Actions, they call it Chitta, mind stuff, the mind waves. Today encelograph machines show you your mind waves or brain waves, new name, their even act doing some measurements on Yogi&rsquo;s and the encelograph machines are going crazy, cannot figure out these measurements at all because no normal brain has these kind of measurements. A Yogi&rsquo;s got some fantastic brain waves especially when they&rsquo;re going through Samadhi, the brainwaves, the machine is erratic now, what happened? They cannot read them but this is thought activity we&rsquo;re talking about, the action of these waves but that&rsquo;s moving towards a certain movement too, it&rsquo;s moving towards Intuitive, that means independent of the senses, your intuition works independent of the senses all the time, it does not depend on any of your senses to function but it&rsquo;s not developed, it has to be developed, it has to be awakened, it&rsquo;s dormant, that means it needs to be activated. Now, but it&rsquo;s going to surprise you all the time because you&rsquo;re going to know things about yourself, things about this entire creation and universe, all independent of your five senses and you wonder how it is done, you see. There is no magic, this is how it works, it is a realm of consciousness just above the brain that links on and it is the totality of things, it&rsquo;s independent of the senses. Now we say Intuition and &ldquo;T&rdquo; so we have mental energy &ldquo;M,&rdquo; &ldquo;E&rdquo; mental energy, &ldquo;D&rdquo; directing, &ldquo;I&rdquo; individual, &ldquo;T&rdquo; thought, &ldquo;A&rdquo; activities, &ldquo;T&rdquo; towards, &ldquo;I&rdquo; intuitive, &ldquo;O&rdquo; now. This &ldquo;O&rdquo; in meditation is a dualistic function, all meditation are dualistic, let&rsquo;s see the dualistic functions of meditation. &ldquo;O&rdquo; observation, we do this as a scientist does, they observe matter to the various minute part of it and we are going to observe science with the same thing, this whole creation to its minute part of it, independent of our senses, and they are dependent on the x-rays of machines to see it, two observations. Then we see the last part of this dualistic function, it&rsquo;s still &ldquo;O,&rdquo; &ldquo;O&rdquo; is dual so we say &ldquo;O&rdquo; is observation, one function, second function now, oneness. 1:40 The scientist is observing with his machinery the structure of creation but a scientist is not becoming one with his creation, there is no scientist who will ever become one with his creation until he meditates. Only the Saint or the realized mystic or a Master is at one with his creation, with this creation, he first observes through meditation then he becomes one and at-one-ment is Samadhi, at-one-ment is cosmic consciousness. Now &ldquo;N,&rdquo; the last letter in meditation, is noumena, not phenomena, reality for the first time, Man is looking at God all the time, that&rsquo;s why we say the Saint is in front of God all the time, he can&rsquo;t go no place, there&rsquo;s no place he can hide himself, where&rsquo;s he gonna hide? In fact in the super conscious realm every man is exposed naked as he born, there is no place you can hide, there&rsquo;s no privacy in God awareness, you can only have privacy in your subconscious mind, you can hide behind all type of mental barriers and hang ups but you cannot hide in super consciousness because everything is torn down and you&rsquo;re exposed for the first time. You become like Adam and Eve when they first ate the fruit of the Garden of Eden, they&rsquo;re exposed you see, this is what happens, you&rsquo;re exposed in the higher realm, therefore you&rsquo;re karma now has to work itself out faster. The moment you start meditating, you would wish you never start to meditate because all your karma start coming, it starts to wind it up, why? Because there&rsquo;s nothing to hide behind. Now if there&rsquo;s nothing to hide behind then you have achieved the highest power but every thought you will apply now or direct, having no dualistic motivation behind it, having no subtle undercurrents in it, it&rsquo;s truth, and the moment you speak it with full conviction the result is a direct materialization because the atomic structure must obey it. That&rsquo;s why they say &ldquo;As a man thinketh in his heart now, that is what he is,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the first time he sees creation coming into manifestation. Now there&rsquo;s a Master who lives in India, his name Sathya Sai Baba, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard of him. A friend of mine wanted his photograph so there was a photographer who took up his camera and was gonna photograph Sai Baba and Sai Baba stopped him. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: We are seeing in the cusp of Kal Yug and Dvapara Yug a man of Sat Yuga, in other words we are seeing something on this Earth thousands of years ahead of its time. When we get in Sat Yuga this is a common thing, do you follow me? No one can assess Sai Baba unless Sai Baba reveals it to that person, that why he says &ldquo;Many people here don&rsquo;t know who I am or what I am, what I represent.&rdquo; One man says, &ldquo;I know what you are.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well what am I?&rdquo; And he starts mumbling but unless Sai Baba reveals this to that person in his meditation, what is happening, that person has no concept of Sai Baba. Sai Baba is a living example of what a man will be in Sat Yug, this is his natural heritage in Sat Yug, o you follow me now? What we would be doing in Sat Yuga period, Sai Baba is doing now, we are seeing a manifestation of God ahead of its time, we do not have records of people in Sat Yuga, we just have a few little information on what Sat Yuga represent and what has been written of Sat Yuga and we have information written when a man gets to Sat Lok what would be his qualities but if we don&rsquo;t see anything in a certain time span, we don&rsquo;t know what it is, we&rsquo;re always seeing in Sai Baba&rsquo;s life is a fulfillment of what Man will be in Sat Yuga.</p>
<h2 id="1969-april-26---part-2-dallas">1969 April 26 - Part 2 Dallas</h2>
<p>Adano69_04_26_2DallasQ2RRNW6 - Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Well let me point out something, thousands of people are sitting down in front of a Master and we have thousand different interpretations of the Master and thousand thousand thousand thousand different needs from that Master, some may be so childish, some will be beyond our comprehension, the Master fills a need that&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s doing, he&rsquo;s filling a need. Now the need that&rsquo;s being filled may seem unusual to some people, it is never he ask you what you want, they never say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna make something for you,&rdquo; Sai Baba doesn&rsquo;t come out and say that, there&rsquo;s always somebody says, &ldquo;Master can I have this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s all right, go ahead, there is a camera, photograph&rdquo; but this is normal for the man to take a photograph of Sai Baba and have the picture developed and give it to you but I&rsquo;m saying if Sai Baba is a manifestation of what Man would be when he&rsquo;s in the Sat Yuga period, that camera would not be existent, it&rsquo;s not the vehicle for for communication, it would be a throwback in time, a camera would be out of place in Sat Yug period, you follow what I&rsquo;m trying to say? You wouldn&rsquo;t even use the camera if you are in the Sat Yug period and here you have a living example of what a Sat Yug man is. In other words he is ahead of his time, you are not in that time, he is ahead of his time so he is speeding up time with consciousness, he&rsquo;s showing you how time is speeded up with consciousness so by doing that (claps hands) through consciousness, he is speeded up, he has capsulated time. This is a very scientific principle, in time scientists will learn this principle of transmutation of matter, there is nothing that we&rsquo;re not going to discover, these laws are all here, everything is going to be discovered but he is only compressing time to fulfill a need. Now the need is not necessarily a religious need, at the moment in the person&rsquo;s life it may feel as a religious need because the awe and the splendor and the majesty of the Master. In the highest realization it is the spirituality of the thing to see that here for the first time the condensation of forces are bringing about reality. Now this person who is receiving this thing, if he is a very advanced/aware person, he would see how slow his conscience is in relation to Sai Baba&rsquo;a consciousness, you follow me? No I don&rsquo;t say for a person who is undeveloped, I&rsquo;m talking of a person who is fairly developed and can see what is going on and understand and comprehend the principles that are involved in this thing, he will see how far he is from this goal, he will get a ratio of his development, it would be like a Master of Art seeing a PhD or a BA seeing a PhD do something you see, one is at the end of the thing and the other one is in the midpoint. Now the student in the first grade cannot comprehend a PhD, see it takes a PhD to comprehend a PhD but a man of BA can have some comprehension of what a PhD is so this would be the exact thing that is happening. Sai Baba, being an example of what this Sat Yug Man would be, is compressing time to give Man in this present time a glimpse of the ratio of limitation of his consciousness that he has to overcome so these things are done not primarily to encourage or develop spiritual (inaudible) in the person or spiritual endeavors but it is strictly to make him realize what lies ahead in his growth, what the tremendous obstacles he may have to overcome to achieve this growth, you see. We don&rsquo;t realize what the obstacles are we are to overcome, we think getting through one little incarnation and get out of the old picture that we&rsquo;re gonna go and sit on cloud nine with the unplayed strings you know, harp and be happy. No, the thing is there is more work to be done on our consciousness, the scientists are admitting today that we only use one tenth portion of the brain, the other nine tenths are not even being used and that nine tenths now they are making measurements on people&rsquo;s brains who have bridged this development and they&rsquo;ve only done this on Yogis because Yogis are the only people who can go to some other level of awareness that the ordinary man can&rsquo;t go in and they are finding out how erratic this machine can be, especially if the man is very very evolved. The more involved he becomes is the more erratic that thing gets, I&rsquo;m afraid if they put it on Sai Baba, the machine may collapse (laughter) because the vibration&hellip; you see the thing is this, the energy will go back into the machine and burn it because you&rsquo;re dealing with a human body with billions of cells and this is atoms already and one atom got so much power in it. Imagine a body weighing 130 to 140 pounds, how much atomic energy you got locked up in here you&rsquo;re not even using, you can&rsquo;t even begin to use it, it&rsquo;s fantastic and we&rsquo;re seeing an example of a brain that is awakened to its true potential that there is no limitation to this brain because thought is energy and energy crystallized becomes matter. So by doing this (clapping sound) the thought of a picture, how fast time is capsulated and compressed into a crystallized physical form to take shape that would require the normal slow process of little ground lens, little black box, a little chemicals and a piece of paper, and a light crawl inside, you make a picture. Look how many years it took Man to crawl with his limited consciousness to make a photographic machine when a Master is saying by an illustration that all this is within the brain and encapsulating time this is done but it&rsquo;s not done to elate the ego. As I said before we do not understand what he&rsquo;s doing, the only way you can understand what he is doing is to know that he is an example of what the Sat Yuga man is because in Sat Yuga there is no mechanical gadgets no more, every man is alive in God, the consciousness is all there, there is so much purity in consciousness now that everything begins to materialize. Now you read in the Autobiography of Yogi that in certain realms the higher beings if they wanted something they just think of it and it&rsquo;s materialized? Now we are assessing Masters today with a Kal Yug consciousness, you see we cannot assess these Masters with this kind of consciousness, we have to understand, we have to step out of that consciousness into a new dimension before we can assess them, we&rsquo;d have to bring our consciousness up to that level to comprehend them. Well I have a friend that has never left the United States to go to and see Sai Baba and Sai Baba materializes for him every day and teaches him in the United States and flies around with him in his plane and Sai Baba materializes everything, the pictures and the Vibhuti and everything. Now if that man was imagining this thing, Sai Baba told someone who is very close to me, an Indian man who is doing research that Mr. So-and-so will write you a letter and in this letter he would say Sai Baba visited him and he would tell you certain things in the letter. 0:10 And when that letter did come, that&rsquo;s exactly as Sai Baba described it and the man has never left America yet to go to India and he still lives in this place here and he is right now in the process of printing Sai Baba&rsquo;s work and doing English corrections in them. So the thing is what is Sai Baba doing, what is he really doing? Most people don&rsquo;t understand it when I say we are seeing a man who is from an age that is Earth and all the planets go through, we are seeing a human being from a different age living with us for the first time. You know science fiction, you ever see people go back in time? Imagine Christopher Columbus going back to the pyramids and telling people the world was round, what would the people at the pyramids do to him? This is a concept, let&rsquo;s say we have Makata going back and tell the early Americans how to fight Cochise, he would be out of time, his military genius is out of time, so he would be considered a multi-super genius, he would be somebody out of time doing these things too fast for them. This is exactly what is happening to us here, we&rsquo;re seeing an example of such a consciousness in our existence. That doesn&rsquo;t say there are other Masters who are fully realized taking us back into God by the natural sequence, Sai Baba is not doing that for us, he didn&rsquo;t say he was doing that, Sai Baba has come among us to reactivate not only as an example of what Sat Yug is but he is reactivating Sanātana Dharma for the first time. The real Sanātana Dharma (inaudible) a chance to come out of the Kal Yug period. You know he was the only man that found the five Lingams that Shankara buried, look how many years Shankara buried those Linghams and nobody knows where it is and Shankara lived in a Treta Yug period not a Sat Yug period so it would take a man from Sat Yug period to discover the works of a Treta Yug period, in other words one has to be above to come down. A man, a PhD is the one who will decipher an M.A.&rsquo;s work, you see what I&rsquo;m trying to say. Shankara lived in a Treta period and buried the Lingams in the various parts of India and from Treta Yug he had the power and the power went to Kal Yug so that whole period all those things were lost. Now where are we going to find these Linghams that we read so much, how are these people going to really believe that this is really true, where is this knowledge, where is this thing that is supposed to be buried? And now comes a man among us and takes it out from the&hellip; (gap in tape)&hellip; we have so much evidence of it, reincarnation, and now we&rsquo;ll go into a little deeper aspect of it. Let&rsquo;s take one part of the scriptures that says &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth a second time but I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; Now that means to a man or a woman who overcome what, what is there to overcome that you won&rsquo;t go forth a second time? Ah! The answer is there right but the mathematical figure is there too, is there a one-time existence or a proportionately opportunity existence in terms of repetition? If one lifespan doesn&rsquo;t permit us to overcome, then we need a proportionate opportunity existence in terms of eternity to overcome and this is true justice. There can be no dictator in the form of a god demanding total sacrifice at the end of one life for your ignorance, it has to be a proportional process because it proves itself. Now I didn&rsquo;t make this statement, it was a great Master who said that, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, he will not go forth a second time but but I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; Now let&rsquo;s say he overcomes, as we establish ignorance is the real thing to overcome, the ability to ignore, to be caught in this process of ignoring, let&rsquo;s say he overcomes that or she overcomes it and don&rsquo;t go forth a second time or does not go forth a hundredth time because you cannot say this is the first time, it might be his hundredth time he attempted to overcome that ignorance and succeeded, it will be his first time in 100 trials, you see. Now let&rsquo;s say he has overcome, now &ldquo;I will make him a pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; Now this house rests on certain pillars, these are fixed properties of the house, a fixed property does not change, does not fluctuate no more, it&rsquo;s not evanascent, there&rsquo;s a sense of permanency in it. Now if I will make that being who has overcome ignorance a pillar then that being cannot lose his identity, cannot lose his conscious relationship with the creative intelligence, it&rsquo;s established permanently now for the first time, &ldquo;A pillar in the house of my Lord.&rdquo; Now this house of the universe has many levels of existence, we have the physical level, we have an astral level, we have a causal level, we have a spiritual level, and we have a non-vibratory level, which one of these levels this pillar will fit in? Depends on what has been overcome. Now let&rsquo;s say we make him the pillar of the window or the door post or somewhere out in whichever that particular thing is most important to this building, that&rsquo;s where that one thing will be. Now what has been overcome by the Soul will rest in one of these categories: physical, astral, causal, spiritual, non-vibratory, you follow so far? Okay, so we know that to overcome ignorance which is the stumbling block, what is it that we do that make us act ignorantly? Our behavior right? There is no other thing that can act ignorantly but within a human person than his behavior. Now let&rsquo;s see if there are certain rules of behavior that are required to overcome. Now let&rsquo;s take the life of Master Jesus, he gave the Sermons on the Mount and how did it begin? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: And that whole sermon is called the what? Audience: The Beatitudes. Adano: The Be-Attitudes, the attitudes of behavior, you know how to be? That&rsquo;s the verb &ldquo;how to be,&rdquo; how to behave, how to act for the first time so if those actions are required to overcome ignorance to prevent you from going forth your hundred and second time, then you see you have the whole essence of liberation in a nutshell but you got to live it, you got to experience it now, this is not word of mouth, this is fusion of consciousness with energy by effort. 0:20 You have to bring your consciousness and a certain potential energy called your body through a certain action which is those attitudes in order to get this result and the results are specifically outlined at the end of the sentence. So let&rsquo;s hear one more, &ldquo;Blessed are the what?&rdquo; Audience: (Inaudible), blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. Adano: Alright, the attitude is expressed and the result is expressed, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in spirit for they shall see God.&rdquo; Now first, to be pure in spirit is an attitude, this takes in your mental nature, your physical nature, your astral nature, your causal nature, and your spiritual nature, and your psychic nature in order to see God but you&rsquo;re not going to see somebody sitting on a throne, you&rsquo;re going to experience the totality of yourself, the God-ness of self, which is freedom and this is liberation, this is the Moksha we&rsquo;re talking about, this has been freed while living, Mutki, salvation is another name for it, saved now, my sins are wiped out, my ignorance is gone. What did Solomon pray for? Wisdom and understanding but understanding is blessedness, understanding is righteousness. Audience: Is that the old meaning in the old testament&hellip; personifying wisdom, Sophia, that big thing, wisdom is the thing. Adano: Alright when we say wisdom, wisdom is not knowledge, big difference between wisdom and knowledge, meditation is an acquired wisdom, education is an acquired knowledge. Now when you&rsquo;ve meditated on what you&rsquo;re studying in theology, there are two vast sets of results in your mechanism. You know the knowledge of theology and you can write it out but you don&rsquo;t have any experience of that theology. When you meditate there are certain things that are changing within your mechanism that gives you a sense of perception, they heighten these perceptions, they give you different revelations within your mechanism, different senses come into play, now no theology can give you that. Now judgment, strength, peace, humility, love, devotion, all that is wisdom, a wise man is not a man who knows too much, it&rsquo;s a man who knows nothing but can Be, does that answer your question? There&rsquo;s nothing there to say but it has been transferred already, it passes, now you understand darshan. You see the Masters and people want to have darshan, they want that transfer, you get it? All right we were talking about reincarnation again, let&rsquo;s look at it, we have a living example of it every day in the four seasons. Here is a tree, in spring it&rsquo;s planted and grows right through the summer the fall and the winter, you may say at winter it should die but comes the next spring what happens? The tree is coming back up again so we plant tomatoes and we get oranges according to the law of the universe and Jesus Christ was right when he said &ldquo;That you sow, you reap&rdquo; so that should be true, plant an orange tree and get tomatoes, huh? That should be right huh? So if that is not right then how are we going to say we have a right to be better than the other person for the conditions we&rsquo;re suffering from? How are we going to say there should be equalities and not inequalities? If the very law does not permit our orange tree to give forth tomatoes and each one of us is a unique example of life in the human body with his own potential qualities, distinct from every other individual, his own load of karma carrying within him, his own seeds to sprout, his own fruit to bear and replenish and harvest is there any inequality now, isn&rsquo;t there total equality and justice in this one law? All right birds and worms live off the same tree, don&rsquo;t you think your environment and the social programming are like birds and parasites off of this human tree? They feed on you till you&rsquo;re age 21 and at that time you&rsquo;re already dry rot and can&rsquo;t face the next winter, see? Now let&rsquo;s say the tree, it&rsquo;s the human being, we see the process repeating itself: spring, summer, winter, or autumn winter, the same fruit coming forth, we are seeing a reincarnating process, we are not seeing something different, a rebirth, it&rsquo;s a reincarnating process, we see a repetitional process of a natural law existing in this world, we don&rsquo;t see no change. This would be like a wheel ground out all the time, there can be no way to get off this wheel, this seed would never change, become any other type of plant. Now, &ldquo;To him that overcometh, I will not send forth second time,&rdquo; there must be some kind of grafting system, some kind of a modification system that will change this process. Audience: But wait a minute, I thought we were supposed evolving, not just going around and around like the oak tree putting on green leaves year by year but rather changing. Adano: Man is changing yes. Let&rsquo;s see what you are talking of and recognize what it really is and let&rsquo;s see ourselves first. The tree goes through the normal routine, year in and year out with the same product and that is reincarnating. Now you have ever seen a grubby worm? You ever see how it gorges itself until it spins a cocoon around itself and then all of a sudden here comes a bigger worm with two pair of wings, with beautiful colors on his back but you don&rsquo;t call him a grubby old one with a pair of rings no more, what do you call him? A butterfly right? How did he become a butterfly? You mean somebody up there with a magic stick wiggle their finger and change him into a butterfly? But it happens all the time, it&rsquo;s right here from a worm into a butterfly and he has to eat himself to death and he has to spin this web around himself like a cocoon and then come forth as a new creature so he must have overcome something. So we have a living example in nature now of overcoming and becoming a new structure, a new identity, we&rsquo;re seeing now not reincarnation, we are seeing resurrection. Now resurrection and reincarnation are two different principles, Man is to evolve into a resurrected state like that grubby little worm into a butterfly but Man is not to remain in the same old reincarnating cycle like an apple tree. 0:30 Now certainly between you and I, we are better than the apple tree and that grubby little worm, why? We are Man, male and female, we are endowed with certain chakras or centers, psychic forces that are locked up in our mechanism for the evolution or the unraveling into a God realization, the fullness of God, but we still have to obey natural laws, we cannot transcend natural laws, we have to live in natural laws, we have to obey these natural laws but we need guidance in the natural laws that&rsquo;s why we have Masters who tell us how to behave. We can reincarnate all the time and our behavior will start to go downwards, we can resurrect ourselves by changing our entire behavior. Now Jesus once said when he was in the body, &ldquo;Take up your cross and follow me,&rdquo; that means each one of us has to make this journey towards resurrection from a reincarnating environment or process by his own initiative, by his own internal suffering, his own internal obligation and sacrifice, his inner devotion and nobody else can do it for you but you need inspiration and it&rsquo;s the inspiration that helps you to model your life on the highest ideal, one who has mastered life. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called Masters, they&rsquo;re not your Master, they&rsquo;re not my Master, they&rsquo;re not pulling me by my nose and take me out to pasture to eat, &ldquo;Lives of great men all reminder us we should make our lives sublime, going ahead of us leaving footprints on the sands of time.&rdquo; These are Masters, Masters of life, they have mastered the principles of behavior, they alone know how to live, they alone know how to behave under all circumstances, they don&rsquo;t offend you physically, they don&rsquo;t offend you mentally, they don&rsquo;t offend you psychically, they don&rsquo;t even offend you spiritually, and in fact they can be led by the nose by you because they are an embodiment of love and compassion and they cannot refuse anyone who comes to them, even little children, &ldquo;Suffer not the little children that come unto me,&rdquo; these children can even pull them by their nose, this is the result. We see now that we have reincarnation and resurrection, we have a choice, where do we have the choice? On where are we evolving to, we&rsquo;re evolving to resurrection, to a higher level of existence in a different realm and the choice is ours. Now anytime the choice is realized it will always be in a human body, you&rsquo;re never going to have the choice outside the human body to make the decision, you&rsquo;re always going to have this opportunity in a human body to make a decision so think one moment how fortunate we are all to have been the only sperm that succeeded up the uterine canal to contact the ovum and became a human body, where all the rest died in the struggle, you see fortunate you all are? You, me, everyone here, there couldn&rsquo;t be two of me at the same time, it&rsquo;d be twins, nature don&rsquo;t allow it unless there are twins there but any time we make the grade and one human being is born, we have realized a tremendous principle was at work, a principle of elimination and success established, a principle of accomplishment was established, therefore you are not failures and cannot be failures. Failure is a result of your environmental thinking, you&rsquo;re all successes, you&rsquo;re all lords of yourself because you made the grade to become a human being, think of it, anybody studying biology should know this by now, right? The mere fact that you became that human being, you have performed the very first law of life, the law of self-accomplishment, this is the real you, this is what you got to realize now, why you can&rsquo;t fail and the Masters have said this, &ldquo;In spite of yourself through the grace of God we will get you there only because you made the grade to become a human being.&rdquo; See? Just think of it because you made the grade to become a human being and you can wake up to the realization, &ldquo;Hah, here I am at last with the human body.&rdquo; This is the blessing, this is the grace of God, this is mark or stamp of divinity on you, you are destined to realization in an incarnation, to be exposed to the divine truth and to realize it about yourself. Now the whole of Dallas is not sitting in this room, how many people are sitting in this room? Their timing ain&rsquo;t come for them to realize it, they have need of many more sufferings, many more hardships, many more mental sacrifices, many more discontents, rise and fall in all their problems in life to shake them up to a realization. Like one disciple, he lived with Master so long and he said to Master, &ldquo;I know God is so great, I should like to spread his word all around.&rdquo; So Master sent him to the village, &ldquo;Well go down in the village and find out who in the village wants God.&rdquo; So he went to the village, ask at every house, &ldquo;Not God, look man I got my business to look after, are you crazy? My wife is getting another baby. You must be nuts, I got a wedding to take care of next week,&rdquo; everybody had some excuse or something. So he came back to the Master, he kept silent, so the Master asked him, &ldquo;Well how you made out? Anybody down there want to buy God?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;No Master.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re happy to be where you are?&rdquo; How many are interested? But those that are interested, it is those who have come to the realization of themselves, who can see the truth of themselves and are not afraid to face it because you&rsquo;re not here to impress nobody, I&rsquo;m not here to impress you, we are here to realize who we are, we&rsquo;re here to see our true potential, we are here to use them, this is what we want. How to live a natural life that we can make the transformation of overcoming the reincarnational process into the resurrected process, this is the evolution, this is the real evolution, this is the real work, all other work was made for us, even the big jobs out in the offices outside in the big buildings, they&rsquo;re all made for us. We&rsquo;re not born or created by divine command to go and become an executive over there, that is made for us by our initiative, by our karma but what are we made for? We are made to realize ourselves, we are made to be a channel for the divine expression. Once you realize that you made the grade to become a human being, you have to realize now that all the qualities of success to God realization are in you, all your creative nature is locked up (inaudible). Now the question comes up, &ldquo;How can we release this thing, how do we go about releasing it?&rdquo; 0:40 We know it&rsquo;s there, we know where we&rsquo;re going, how do we release it? Well let&rsquo;s go back to qualified men who have given us the way how to release it, let&rsquo;s take Jesus for one, there are many in the east but we are familiar with Jesus and his sayings so we can understand it better, &ldquo;If thine eyes be single, this body is full of life&rdquo; but let&rsquo;s see how many people can interpret it as what Jesus meant it to be, very few. Jesus, when he spoke of it he literally meant that when you look inside you will see L-I-G-H-T, light of its true atomic nature, literally in that sense he meant it. Now to the spiritual student seeking to understand himself this experience does exist, anyone who has ever attempted to meditate sincerely has had this experience, he has had that experience and he can vouch for that light, it&rsquo;s not hallucination, there is no need for any drugs to produce it, all that is required is love that&rsquo;s why He said, &ldquo;Love your lord thy God with all your mind and Soul and your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; this love triggers that light off. Anyone who has seen the light can testify that the light has three distinct colors, there are many colors he will see inside of himself but there are three distinct colors in here that will never go any place, was never invented by Man, was stamped there by the Divinity Himself when He created this universe. The first color and the outward ring is a gold band or the Holy Spirit as it is called by the Christians, in science it&rsquo;s called the cosmic vibration of the universe, all matter has a vibration and is only distinguished by its rate of vibration. So speech in any language are different rates of vibrations in the consciousness and when you hear a man talking in tongues, it has never been seen that the men who have had the experience of this consciousness talk in tongues in a conversational way, they talk in tongues in prayers, they may say a prayer in various tongues but only Masters who have this development can hold a conversation in any tongue. Now let&rsquo;s take a Master like Sai Baba, Sai Baba is living today in India, some people came to see him, there was a Japanese professor in Japanese and didn&rsquo;t speak a word in English let alone Mariaki, all he spoke was Japanese and very little Hindi but there was a person there who could translate Japanese and when the man was introduced to Sai Baba before the translator can begin to translate, Sai Baba spoke to him in perfect Japanese, held a conversation for approximately a whole hour and corrected a Japanese man in his grammar. Now he&rsquo;s not speaking in tongues, a few little prayers that happen in the Tabernacles here in this tongue you know, people get an awakening and they say they&rsquo;re speaking in tongues, that is not what we&rsquo;re talking about, that&rsquo;s not speaking in tongues, that&rsquo;s just prayers coming through filtering down from that consciousness, we&rsquo;re talking of something that has to do with Divinity for the first time. Now he didn&rsquo;t only held a conversation in Japanese, he held it in many languages: German, Swiss, Dutch, French, Italian, perfect and in fact correcting them as professors in their own language, see this is a big difference with a realized consciousness, it&rsquo;s a consciousness that has nothing to do with phenomena. Now this ring of gold is there and you see it and it stays with you for a long time and you have to pass through it and develop in it and you hear a high-pitched sound coming from it and you hear it in your right ear. Now in the scriptures it is said that, &ldquo;Lo I turned to the East and I heard a voice of God like running water and like a trumpet behind me&rdquo; and people did not understand what the prophet was talking about. He was meditating and looked inside, this is the East of Man, this is the West in Man, this is the North in Man, and this is the South in Man because Man is a miniature universe. &ldquo;Lo I looked to the East,&rdquo; this part has often been written in oriental scriptures as the Door of the East or Star of the East or the Eastern Eye and it&rsquo;s the same thing on your dollar bill, you see it on top of the pyramid in the dollar bill, where do you think they got their ideas from? I&rsquo;ll tell you a little story about that before I go too far out, while they were debating how to make the Seal of this country behind bar doors and they did not know how to make up the Seal, they were worried about the time, all of a sudden they heard a knock on the door, they wanted to know who it was and the summoned the orderly of the day and he opened the door and entered a man very dignified, wearing a cape with a high collar with a briefcase on his arm and walk right up to the table and said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, here are the diagrams of your new Seal,&rdquo; put it down there and while they were looking at this, he walked out. By then they turned around to see where the man was, he had gone and this is on record in the Library of Congress. Audience: Oh wow. Adano: Where did this man came from and where he is gone no one knows, how did he have a complete plan for the US Seal and even your dollar bill has that design on it and that design of the eye on the pyramid is not an invention of that period, it is one of the oldest symbols of East representing Divinity in Man, the pyramid going this way and the eye, third eye in Man, and you will find this same design in all the Masonic lodges in the country. Did a Mason walk in and give it to them, how would he know that they were in conference at that particular moment debating the fact that they&rsquo;re going to make a golden Seal of the country? But this is on record, they do not know who it is, who that man is, in the first place he doesn&rsquo;t fit any person of this environment at a time because everyone in the environment was well known and accounted for, it was a very small community. Where would he come from? He&rsquo;d have to come a long way and he&rsquo;d have to ride some type of a horse or a vehicle to get there to give it to them, only the big boys up there know where he came from. One of the big boys know up there where he came from, well let&rsquo;s forget where he came from, let&rsquo;s go to something else but that is on record though, it is on record, you can get that in the Library of Congress. Now the third eye is here, this is the door that Jesus talked of, this is the way to go back in and there&rsquo;s a golden ring, gold, and inside the golden ring is blue. Now the golden ring is called the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost or Cosmic Vibration of the universe in matter. The blue is called the Christ Intelligence, not Jesus, so you see why Jesus had to say, &ldquo;The things I do, you can do also and greater things you can do&rdquo; or will do, it would be kind of ridiculous for him to say, &ldquo;The things I do, you will do also and not greater than Me.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t that sound kind of ridiculous? When he fully realized that this thing was already in you, that this creator had already placed this force in you, each human being being a replica of the thing, he himself a realized example of it. 0:50 He knew all these levels inside, we don&rsquo;t know the levels because we don&rsquo;t know how to go inside to it, until we&rsquo;re shown to go in then these levels are revealed to us, this is our heritage. We&rsquo;ve made the grade to become a human being, we&rsquo;ll make the grade be realized while in the body and he knew that, that&rsquo;s why he went on being an example from reincarnation to resurrection. Now the blue is the Christ intelligence, that is the intelligence present in vibratory creation. Creation is based on its rates of vibration, everything here is a rate of vibration, this is only way we can differentiate it scientifically in the lab. Now the intelligence inside of it now that means the thing that brings it together and binds it into a matrix and gives it a purpose or an identity, this is called the Christ intelligence, now let&rsquo;s see why they use the word Christ. In the east it&rsquo;s called Kutastha Chaitanya, which means intelligently directing vibratory force. Now in the Greek language Christos or Christ means attainment so when they are referring to the Christ intelligence they are referring to an attainment of a consciousness in the vibratory structure of matter by Man&rsquo;s own consciousness. Man has to arrive at this consciousness by personal attainment, personal effort then they say you are a Christos, you have attained and therefore you are Jesus the Christ, you are David the Christ, you are Gopal the Christ or Krishna. The Hindu Christ was called Krishna, see Krishna or Christ in the same thing you can spell it K-R-I-S-H-N-A or C-R-I-S-T-H or C-H-R-I-S-T-N-A, Krishna or Christ, it&rsquo;s all taken from the one concept that is the intelligence present in vibratory creation. Now let&rsquo;s see what are its properties in that realm. In the gold ring the first property as I said before is a communication, you can speak in tongues, you can heal, raise the dead, and do many things but you can communicate telepathically, you can see into the structure of matter, these are all the gifts of the spirit just from the lower level alone from the Holy Spirit, we haven&rsquo;t even begun to go further into your true nature yet, the Christ nature in Man. In the Christ nature of Man you&rsquo;re endowed with the ability to materialize your thoughts at will for the first time. Now imagine you&rsquo;re in possession of such a power but you&rsquo;re untrained and egotistical, what would you do? You&rsquo;ll make a menagerie of this universe, you&rsquo;ll make a crazy house out of it because you don&rsquo;t have no discipline, you don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. You&rsquo;ll say drop dead and everything will drop dead and you will say something else and that will happen so before you know it, all goes out to kilter but this ability or this power is not bestowed on the undisciplined individual, it is not bestowed upon the egotistical individual because you could never get past the first ring of spirituality without all those wrong attitudes being washed out of your system. That&rsquo;s why he says &ldquo;Seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness,&rdquo; the right attitudes, &ldquo;And these things will be added.&rdquo; See now why he says added? So these qualities come when the right attitude is established. Then finally in the blue there is a five-pointed white star or superstar, within the star there is a door and your consciousness goes through that door and up into a crooked tunnel right into the thousand petal lotus. Now this is where all the yogis stop, this is where revelations of the scriptures stop. Now this is where we begin to meditate, we don&rsquo;t stop there, we start there now, we begin at that level. From there on Bhajan or true devotion begins, Simran, true identity begins and then the five sounds or the five names of God comes through and take you up to Sat Lok or the eternal existing force between manifested creation and the unmanifest creation, way beyond now the thousand petal lotus, you see where we&rsquo;re going now? This is called the Shabad, now you see what the Masters are talking about, the path of the Masters begins from there, Jesus is talking of that. It is there at that point, &ldquo;I am my Father are one,&rdquo; &ldquo;You see me, you see the Father.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re seeing dynamic atomic energy for the first time in crystallized matter devoid of image or shadow and cannot be photographed when not wanted to be photographed. No Master you can photograph if he doesn&rsquo;t want you to photograph him. You know Master Charan Singh? There was a girl with a movie camera and she was trying to photograph him and a woman saw Master standing there, she says, &ldquo;Master can I be in this picture?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well you better ask that woman but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any more film to take you in the picture.&rdquo; So the girl who owned the camera did not understand what the Master meant by that because she&rsquo;d only use half of the film and she kept on grinding and what came out of that whole set of film you know what? The moment that woman asked to be in the picture, those are the last pictures she could take, all the rest ran out blank and only in that last end of the film where the blank was the woman alone standing and there was no Master and the person is a wife of a very famous doctor in Canada and the doctor when he saw that, he realized what the Master was talking for the first time, he got shook up. For the first time he got shook up as to the reality of a Master and the Master told him &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any film in that camera&rdquo; but he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt her feelings and say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you in the picture,&rdquo; you see what he wanted to teach that woman was the lesson of this: she did not ask the right person to be in the picture, she asked the wrong person to be in the picture. The woman was photographing the Master and this other person wanted to be standing next to the Master to be caught in the picture hoping that she will go home with her friends, &ldquo;I was photographed with the Master.&rdquo; Master read her thoughts so clear and loud, had she gone and asked the woman and the woman says, &ldquo;Okay Master would you permit this woman to be in the picture with you?&rdquo; The Master would have granted her but because her ego was so blatantly exposed he taught her a lesson that he is not here to be made (inaudible). There&rsquo;s another time, you remember Lahiri Mahasaya? In the life of Lahiri Mahasaya, this is a Master who lived not too long ago, and a disciple wanted to photograph him so badly just to have a living replica of what this Master would look like and he didn&rsquo;t grant him that. So he came when the Master was busy bathing and no way to get out from the bathtub, he&rsquo;s gonna be exposed naked and he busy shooting pictures of Master, one after the other. There was a thirteen plates exposed, he ran home very happy, he caught Master napping in what you call a very unusual situation, no way for him to refuse. He developed it, all he&rsquo;s got is the bench with the towel, the tub of water, there ain&rsquo;t no Master in the picture. 1:00 All thirteen plates exposed is the same thing, here they are, so he&rsquo;s frustrated. He come back, he says &ldquo;Master please help me.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;Ah ha! How can you capture the Divine Spirit in a camera? The Divine Spirit is light, who can capture the Divine Spirit?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t realize that this man was at that level you see, that the Masters were in Sat Lok, the eternal level between vibration and non-vibration, that is pure total cosmic consciousness, this is God realization, &ldquo;I and my Father are one.&rdquo; When Jesus was alive if somebody had tried to photography him (inaudible), they would have a heck of a time trying to explain it where he was, there&rsquo;s no way to photograph a person at that level because it is the divinity manifesting there at that moment. Now you need a shadow to photograph a human being, you realize that? When you expose the camera to your body what do you think really helps them to capture that film? If you don&rsquo;t have a shadow, if your body doesn&rsquo;t have carbon molecules that would diffuse the light at a certain rate, so the guy is exposed to a sensitive plate, it would never take a picture of you. You think you can photograph this glass? What would you get? Let&rsquo;s say you put the camera right here and you shoot a picture of the glass, you only get the outside but you never get the glass. What is the glass composed of? Molecules of silicon, atoms of silicon, chemicals of silicon, it&rsquo;s like a diamond now so the light is passing right through it. In a realized Master he has overcome by his attitudes the molecular structure that impedes the Divine Light in him. Now we&rsquo;re dealing with something vast and beyond our little literature of the scriptures and theology, we&rsquo;re dealing with the first scientific evidence of spiritual science, that Man is indeed God in flesh but Man has to awaken this God-ness by the right attitude and every evidence that to try to photograph this mechanism when that person is at that level of development. Now this level of development is not something for a few people, it is for all Mankind if they make the effort in this incarnation then they&rsquo;re exposed to it. You know one time somebody tried to photograph Yogananda you know, Yogananda was alive up to 1952, all the film was blanks, he didn&rsquo;t want to be photographed that particular day. Every time they exposed it all blanks, when a Master wants you to have a record of his frame, he has to slow down in consciousness. Now in Lahiri Mahasaya was the same thing, when that devotee came and pleaded so much to him, &ldquo;Master at least gave me one picture,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;Okay, tomorrow you come back here I&rsquo;ll pose for the picture&rdquo; and in the same case in Charan Singh you know, when he&rsquo;s granting them, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pose for the picture.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll always hear he uses this term, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll post for that picture,&rdquo; goes to show you what he&rsquo;s doing. Now in Sai Baba&rsquo;s case, Sai Baba don&rsquo;t let too many people photograph him, those who he grants there&rsquo;s just a few pictures that have been photographed of him and you will see the shadow in the picture that&rsquo;s being photographed. Now the pictures Sai Baba materializes of himself have no shadow in them and it looks like the chair is floating slightly off the floor and it&rsquo;s out of line with the side beam of the wall, it&rsquo;s distinctly off line and anybody that look at it cannot explain that because it&rsquo;s how that is not possible. You can see the line of the floor and you&rsquo;ll see the chair is slightly off line and it&rsquo;s all sharp in almost a three-dimensional relief and I don&rsquo;t know if you came down to my house inside, that&rsquo;s one he materialized of himself, he had no one photograph that but he permitted that, showing that he is in that state already. Now he says this is nothing for one of these men, this is for all mankind and they give you the technique, he doesn&rsquo;t say to stop loving Jesus in fact he makes you conscious that Jesus did it. See most people don&rsquo;t even realize what Master Jesus did you know, that this is a thing that you can go in and awaken. We&rsquo;re dealing with a technique of how to go in and we know what to look for: there&rsquo;s a gold ring, a blue light in that ring, and there&rsquo;s a five-pointed star and that five-point star is like a door, you pass through it and when you pass through it you see yourself outside of yourself and there you get the first experience now of living and dying daily in the lord like Saint Paul. Now this is not astral projection, astral projection begins from the solar plexus, Soul travel begins at the third eye, Trikuti, point between the eyebrows where Jesus is talking of, this is something that comues up. Now Paul Twitchell spent many years developing Soul travel and he calls Eckankar but Eckankar or Soul travel only goes up to one level, it doesn&rsquo;t go right away up to Sat Lok because you need a Master to take you there, you need a Master to bring you there, &ldquo;I am the advocate&rdquo; that Jesus said, &ldquo;I am your guide on the inner realms, none cometh unto the Father but by Me.&rdquo; No one can enter cosmic consciousness except by the Guru because the Guru is a living manifestation of God, one who has attained, so how is it possible for a man after he gets up in that level is going to say he&rsquo;s found God by himself? Impossible, now you understand why Gurus exist, why Masters exist, &ldquo;I am the advocate,&rdquo; you see. What is an advocate? In french an &ldquo;advocat&rdquo; is a lawyer, one who pleads your case, if we have come from a realm of reincarnation and striving to reach a realm of resurrection and overcoming certain ignorances, we certainly can&rsquo;t plead our own case by ourself. In an earthly court it&rsquo;s looked down upon and the heavenly court is even looked down worse, very few people can really plead their case but they have one or two instances where they&rsquo;ve done it but they still have reference to a Guru, that some Guru steps in for that moment and give them the plea, a Master comes in all the time to take you on, that&rsquo;s why Master is important. Now there was a Saint called Swami Prabhavananda, he meditated for years and had wonderful experiences in meditation but he could never make the bridge with that higher consciousness with God, the full realization, and he went to his Guru Lahiri Mahasaya and he said to him, &ldquo;Master I want to enter that state permanently but I can&rsquo;t seem to get there. I see God in you manifest but would you help me?&rdquo; And Lahiri Mahasaya says, &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;ll meditate upon it. Go, I will intercede.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will intercede, I will plead your case, I will absolve you of the last vestiges of karma, I will pay your debt for you now, I can afford to offer a spiritual bank reference or credit in your name.&rdquo; Do you follow what is involved in this thing? This is what we call the darshans again, the intercessions, the love, the advocate, the pleading. 1:10 So Lahiri Mahasaya that night meditated and Prabhavananda went home on that same night, at a specific time he used to meditate, he burst right into the pure cosmic for the first and final time, he never came out of that state except to come back down into the body to live and perform his duties but then after he was in that state, he came to his Guru and he made this remark, &ldquo;Blessed is the Guru because he alone absolves us from our karma but Guru how can I now live in this world without any income, I&rsquo;m such a young man and I don&rsquo;t want to take charity.&rdquo; So the Guru says, &ldquo;Apply for a pension in the company you&rsquo;re working for.&rdquo; Well a young man applying for pension below the pension age, you could imagine what would happen, what is he going to get? Well he went and applied for this pension and he had to see the company doctor and he told the company doctor what was happening he says, &ldquo;At times when I&rsquo;m doing my work, a sensation of current seems to come up in the back of my head and make me unfit to do my duty.&rdquo; But Lahiri Mahasaya had already telepathically placed in the mind of the doctor to grant him his pension, his resignation, with a very high stipend because he was physically unfit to perform his duties. From a medical standpoint he was granted his high pension and he went back to his Ashram, or house, and he followed his meditation all through the years after but the thing is he did not depend on charity, he had his pension or he might have kept on working and still carried on his meditational classes like Lahiri Mahasaya did. See Lahiri Mahasaya worked as an engineer during the day and at night he had his meditation classes and his boss, who was an Englishman, was looking very sad one day and he said to his boss, &ldquo;Why are you sad?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I have some very distressing news of my wife who&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo; So he said to his boss, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll get some information for you.&rdquo; So the boss calls him &ldquo;Estatic Babu.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Estatic Babu I know you&rsquo;re an unusual man, you&rsquo;re not a very usual person in this office but I can&rsquo;t conceive how you will transcend time and space to get some kind of information about my wife who lives in England.&rdquo; So Lahiri did&rsquo;t pay no attention to him, he just went outside in his yard, he sat down and he meditated. Came back and told him he says, &ldquo;You know your wife is well and she&rsquo;s writing you a letter, you&rsquo;ll receive it soon.&rdquo; This boss of his look at him as if, &ldquo;well let&rsquo;s humor the old boy, he must be nuts, anything can happen under this Indian sun.&rdquo; So he let it go at that. Not too long ago he received a letter, his wife is enroute to India from England and she&rsquo;s well and she arrives at the office, she walks in the room, instead of going to her husband, she walks over to this Indian old man and says, &ldquo;Revered Sir, it was you who appeared in my room and I was instantaneously healed and I got up to write my husband a letter.&rdquo; Now did he transcend time and space, huh? This is what I&rsquo;m trying to say, at that level there is nothing and this is true, this goes on all the time with the devotees of Masters, there is that communication, there is that link based on devotion. Yes? Audience: I want to ask (inaudible) you made a very sharp distinction between self-realization and God-realization (inaudible). Adano: Self-realization deals with all the development up to the thousand petal lotus, you follow me? And it deals with all the lower chakras, it deals with Hatha Yoga and everything, all this is self-realization. Now God realization begins at the thousand petal lotus and goes up to the five levels of consciousness above the thousand petal lotus that leads into the unmanifested state or non-vibratory state of God which is Sat Lok, it takes you to Sat Lok. Now the Masters do not stop at the thousand petal lotus, they stop at the Sat Lok which is above. Now it is there where the real Masters or Saints exist, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the Sant Mat, the path of the Saint or the Masters of cosmic consciousness, there is where Nirvikalpa Samadhi is all the time, Saint in the Nirvikalpa stays in that Sat Lok state, that is the God-realized state. Now below Nirvikalpa Samadhi we have Savikalpa Samadhi and that is in the thousand petal lotus state you see? Now we said Para Braham is beyond Braham, so Man is calling on God as Braham or Brahman, he&rsquo;s still calling below the thousand petal lotus, he has to call on Para Braham which is beyond Braham, this is in the Sat Lok state or the unmanifested or the non-vibratory state of creation where the pure intelligence and pure love is residing. Now in Sanatana Dharma or Vedanta, God is often referred to as Sat, Chit, Ananda. Sat is the Sat Lok state, there is where the existence is manifesting from the unmanifest, there is where existence is coming out in vibration, that is the highest (gap in tape)&hellip; the cosmic song and the Word was with God in unmanifest state and the Word IS God the Dun is God, cosmic law or cosmic sound, the Barmey is God already and &ldquo;the word was made flesh,&rdquo; that Dun became matter, slowed down in vibration and became crystallized atomic energy. Now, &ldquo;and became flesh and dwelt in Man&rdquo; so you hear that Dun in the right ear all the time, eventually you hear it in the third eye or Trikuti right here. Now it pulls you up, you see it pulls you up past the thousand petal lotus so the Masters will say &ldquo;when you get to Sat Lok from there on the Dun takes over,&rdquo; from there on God as the cosmic sound or cosmic word or logos is the escalator into the unmanifest, this is where we&rsquo;re talking God-realization now, it is a capstone between self-realization and God-realization. See self-realization deals with all the levels below, these are all the various levels below, all the different Chakras, it deals with all of Patanjali&rsquo;s Sutras and everything, that&rsquo;s all self-realization but above that is God-realization but you must have self-realization in order to comprehend God-realization, you must have your BA or MA before you can have your PhD. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: How about a little meditation? Good. (Gap in tape). And you have to continue in that peace that begins to saturate your cells. Now beginners may not see it but people who are affiliated or associated with, will see a change, a light in their face, that is what attracts them to them, they want to know what they&rsquo;re doing now, what is altering their whole inner structure. That&rsquo;s why when Jesus said, &ldquo;Let your light so shine before Men that they may see your good works and glorify the Father which is in you,&rdquo; he was referring to the results of meditation, this inner light that you are trying to perceive in meditation. It starts to radiate now from the mechanism and you don&rsquo;t see it yourself and you may think that you&rsquo;re not advancing or not getting results but you are getting results because it&rsquo;s only those who can see it in you or who know you and see the change, they can recognize whatever change in you. What it is they don&rsquo;t know, you know, but there&rsquo;s something in you that attracts them after and it&rsquo;s the attitude and it&rsquo;s the strength that comes from it because you know now you have the keys how to go in. 1:20 That&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;Unto you are given the keys of the kingdom.&rdquo; You have the keys of how to go in and tap inner reservoir of peace wherever you are, whatever you&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s not to run away from obligation but it is to face obligation with this peace, there is where divinity really is, there is where spirituality is. Spirituality is not religious, it has nothing to do with churchianity, spirituality has to do with hammering out Divinity in the flesh by a day to day involvement with you and God. You hammer out your own divine gold g-o-l-d, you bring it into manifestation through the help of Masters, Saints, and those disciples who live on the Earth who are meditating. That&rsquo;s why Jesus said, &ldquo;When two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; This is an amplification process like a loudspeaker, like an amplifier, it increases the volume of your depth of meditation and the overflow from others helps you to go deeper into yourself, to study yourself, by your own self you can go so deep that you need the assurance, you need the amplification, you need that added volume so group meditation was emphasized a long time by the Master Jesus as a method, a natural method of amplifying one&rsquo;s consciousness, a method of increasing the volume of one step in meditation. That was the origin of churches too but they did not understand what He meant, &ldquo;Build me a temple that I may dwelt in the midst thereof&rdquo; so they went and build beautiful architectural buildings, forgetting the human body, that this is the real temple. It&rsquo;s like this song my friend Kriyananda sings, Sam Brown or Sam Jones, all day long he polished the church pew and the brass in the church Saturday and he came to pray on Sunday and he said &ldquo;this cannot be Sam, because you know what you are and you know what we are.&rdquo; So Sam went home that night and he was in torture and torment with his family and he tried to pray. Just then he heard a knock and he saw the Lord Jesus walk in and the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Sam, do not cry, you have no better luck than I who has been trying to get into that church for the past 30 years.&rdquo; Divinity has nothing to do with our outward life, it&rsquo;s an inward process, it&rsquo;s a hammering out of the softer nature of yourself, it is a refining process, it&rsquo;s a daily refining process, this is the divinity you&rsquo;re looking for. We&rsquo;re not here to impress no one because each one here comes with a certain need, a certain goal, and the final goal is that we all want to go back home to this Divine Consciousness which is where we all belong in the first place but each one of us is bringing his own cross, his own sack of troubles on his back, there&rsquo;s a story in India. There&rsquo;s a temple called the Shiva temple and a man who&rsquo;s a pilgrim is carrying a sack of stones on his back, it was considered his cross or his problems and he went in this temple to Shiva and he said, &ldquo;Lord Shiva, I got lots of problems. Why in this incarnation you make it so tough? Could you give me a smaller problem, a smaller Karma?&rdquo; Well in front of this temple there is a statue of Shiva, there were various sacks of different sizes and all of a sudden the statue in the temple opens its eyes and looked at the man and said, &ldquo;O man, I have compassion on you, put down your sack, pick up any one you think you can carry, it is yours.&rdquo; So the man was so happy to hear the idol talk, he dropped his sack and he ran for the smallest little thing that he could pick up and he tried to lift it, he couldn&rsquo;t lift it, frustrated he tried the next size one, he couldn&rsquo;t lift that and he tried and tried eventually you know what he picked up? The sack brought with him, he couldn&rsquo;t take other men&rsquo;s problems because you cannot carry another man&rsquo;s cross, you carry your own cross, your own cross is the process of your own thinking, the program heretical, the program karma, that is yours. You don&rsquo;t take no one&rsquo;s, you take your own, and your own is well fitted out for you, it is not more than you can bear because all these things come to pass but not the stay. If they were to come to be a permanent thing in your life you&rsquo;d never make the grade because they are temporary you pass through. Well folks (inaudible). Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Everyone&rsquo;s got a cross to carry, your cross is lighter now and than the other man&rsquo;s cross you see. Always go with a happy attitude, school is still made for you, not you for the thing, all these things were made for you within your certain framework of the environment and the society. There was a time in my days you could drop out, it was never considered something bad, no one ever thought of it because in those days it was never compulsory to be educated. Today because of the growing competition in society and the tremendous responsibility of the world around us, we are born into an environment only because this is a karma we have to work out. So we&rsquo;re placed in it to learn a lesson, what is the lesson? Endurance, fortitude, ssense of self-respect, and gratitude because you have to be grateful to your parents who make it possible for you to be here, though it may not be the best situation for you at the moment but at the same time it gives you the fortitude to appreciate it and persevere. It gives you the discipline that you need to concentrate in meditation, you can&rsquo;t have a waving mind in concentration, you can&rsquo;t be weaving all over the joint trying to find God, you got to be like a needle pointing north all the time, that calls for tremendous dedication and devotion so once you bring this into focus in your daily work in school, you will have the same opportunities like all the Masters that go through. Master Charan Singh who is alive is both an engineer and a lawyer, now he had to struggle through all those courses to get up there then before he can branch out and (inaudible) to spiritual people. Master Yogananda struggled through his Bachelor of Arts study and many other Masters have to struggle through, some of them were just getting through with the mearest passing grades but that&rsquo;s the unimportant thing, as long as they fulfill the environmental obligation that their parents have allowed them to partake in, you see what I mean? Now they know their life work may not be that, many people&rsquo;s life work may not necessarily be the thing that they&rsquo;re trained in or educated in because their whole spiritual nature and creative nature can come out and do something else but as long as this obligation and this opportunity is brought into our lives for a limited period, we must learn to have spiritual teamwork, we must learn to harness our senses, it gives us the freedom. 1:30 You see as I said you&rsquo;re not responsible for where you&rsquo;re born but you are responsible with whom you associate all the time even in school and out of school because group meditation can be group study. You can all exchange your ideas and what you&rsquo;re learning because the more you talk of it to the next person, the more there&rsquo;s a different slant or view of looking at this thing and gives you a better understanding what you&rsquo;re studying, sounds kind of dreary, dogmatic. Now, but this is what we have to live through it and don&rsquo;t fight it, nothing to fight, might have taken it in stride. I remember David didn&rsquo;t want to go back to school but I said how are you going to associate in this spiritual life if you don&rsquo;t go back and do the thing? Same with Randy and Randy was going to drop out, I says &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t come to my ashram or my place and sit down and expect I&rsquo;m going to the down there lugging around in the sun and you&rsquo;re going to sit down and meditate and don&rsquo;t want to go to school? And it broke the concept, he&rsquo;s free, this is it, (inaudible). Once you get the disciplining of your consciousness you are free because you&rsquo;re not doing it to impress nobody, you&rsquo;re not trying to pass a hundred percent or no percent, you&rsquo;re trying to get through an obligation by the grace of God, this is all because you have already made the grade as a human being, you will make the grade through your obligations by God&rsquo;s grace all the time. You are not a failure, you were never intended to be a failure, you&rsquo;re intended to get through your obligation. Audience: Adano, Masters tell you to do everything in their name or in God&rsquo;s name, like when you&rsquo;re doing any kind of an action no matter how small&hellip; Adano: Seva. Audience: &hellip;you&rsquo;re always doing that conscious thing saying &ldquo;I dedicate this to you.&rdquo; Adano: Right and once you dedicate this consciousness to Him, it is He who directs the Divine Souls or disciples of other Masters to pull you through and He doesn&rsquo;t have to come down from an ashram to do it to you, he can drop a few pages out in the yard or He can let somebody run into you and all of a sudden discuss your subjects which you have experienced, take the book at random open it up just what you&rsquo;re supposed to know about and go ahead and pass your exam and Yogananda said this, &ldquo;Because I pity the man who has to look after the midnight oil and God can also be in the classrooms too.&rdquo; You see some people think that God can&rsquo;t be there but God is consciousness and intelligence and energy and He is in you, that&rsquo;s why I said before the fact that you are here: memory, concentration, love, these three qualities will pull it in because there is a funny strange way these things seem to fall into your life that you get just the right information for what you need to do that moment, this is it. Many of us have had this experience in whatever cross you&rsquo;re carrying or wherever your cross is at the moment or whatever station of the cross you&rsquo;re at the moment, that is the particular obligation. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Ah teacher, don&rsquo;t you love to hear such nice words that students love you? Flattery will get you nowhere (laughter). Oh that is very good discipline sister, you passed the grade. As I was telling her, one way to get all the classes to pass is to write on the blackboard, &ldquo;From now on I&rsquo;m teaching you how to fail.&rdquo; So everybody ain&rsquo;t going to want to know they&rsquo;re going to fail, they want to know how to pass so before you know it, &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t give me inferior education.&rdquo; You see that&rsquo;s one way to make a student interested in their education now, just write in a blackboard and tell them, &ldquo;From now on I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to fail all your exams.&rdquo; Not that you&rsquo;re going to fail them you see. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: See that is true, they have all been students, they had to go through, they have to go through a physical body and go to school, in fact imagine the masses of the future, what the problems will be with them? They have to know binary theorems and all kind of things before they&rsquo;ll ever make the grade to come out to the Guru. They gotta go through all the computer and calculus and everything because the education system is going to be that you don&rsquo;t get out of school until your age 32. Well one Master, he&rsquo;s an engineer and then he&rsquo;s a lawyer, that takes lots of education to get there before he even became a teacher. So he didn&rsquo;t shirk that responsibility but it&rsquo;s not trying to study with the idea you have to make a hundred percent marks, it&rsquo;s the idea that you have an obligation to complete and that there is a passing grade and you make it with the grace of God and complete it and get it behind, out of the way, you&rsquo;ve done the job. This is the whole ID, to do the work, not to shirk the work, it&rsquo;s not to be afraid to face the work, you are going to be like the ostrich that buries its head in the ground with the slightest noise and you don&rsquo;t want (inaudible), the idea is to get through this, to get through this period of life and the Masters are telling us the same thing, our attitudes even to the end of life is how to get through it, how to overcome these obligations because what are obligations? Opportunities how to fail or how to succeed. Now if you never have an opportunity to fail, you don&rsquo;t know how weak you are, you have an inflated ego and think you&rsquo;re a very strong person but the moment you fail then you see the weakness in you, you see the limitedness of you, then you begin to see the humility in you, then you have an opportunity now to resuscitate yourself, regenerate devotion, regenerate humility, and regenerate strength, you are able to tap this reservoir in yourself for the first time, you&rsquo;re really definitely interested in tapping it (inaudible). I know it&rsquo;s getting late and folks have to get home and it&rsquo;s a long way. Audience and Adano: (General conversation). &hellip; that&rsquo;s all right that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re linked on for the same the frequencies&hellip; the important thing is that you can hear it, you just keep on going, don&rsquo;t stop&hellip; the important thing is your devotion and dedication to it&hellip; 1:40 (Gap in tape). Adano: The young jumps on his back and hold on, that&rsquo;s God help yourself attitude. You ever see a mother cat with its kitten, what does it do with its kitten? She picks the kitten and puts it where she puts it so this is the difference between being a monkey and trying to exert your own ego (inaudible)&hellip; those who help themselves, baby monkey hangs on to mama monkey and the two of them move around and that&rsquo;s &ldquo;heaven helps those who help themselves,&rdquo; but the heaven who really helps is like a mother cat and her kitten. The mother cat with a kitten, the kitten is here and he wants that kitten to go over there he&rsquo;s going to pick it up by the neck and take it and place it over there and that kitten has so much confidence in his mother knowing what&rsquo;s best for him and this is the difference between Divine Will and my will. Audience: (inaudible) &hellip;effortlessness. Adano: All right, effortless effort. See &ldquo;Divine Mother willing&rdquo; it happens, if She&rsquo;s not willing nothing happens. You&rsquo;ve been along so long with this study now, you&rsquo;ve had too many experiences to see Divine Mother&rsquo;s manifestation, what more do you want? You&rsquo;re still questioning in the Divine Principle, how it works? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Divine Mother willing all things will happen. Audience: Yeah and I said I don&rsquo;t understand why sometimes there are little lull periods. Adano: The lull period is not Divine Mother&rsquo;s problem, it is your problem. Audience: (Laughter). Adano: You can&rsquo;t blame the gap between two waves on Divine Mother, there&rsquo;s always a gap, there are no two waves riding on top each other, you ever see that in the ocean? There&rsquo;s always a gap between each one, there is going to be a lull, that&rsquo;s RAM, you should understand the principle around by now. Audience: Oh yeah. Adano: Well there is the lull. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: You better teach him the principle of RAM, he should know it by now. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Ok, you heard the principle of RAM. Audience: Could you go through that again? Audience: Resistance, Adjustmen,t Mutation, and (inaudible) then saturation period, lag, recurrence. Adano: Okay that&rsquo;s your devil, all right spell devil backwards. Audience: Lived. Adano: That&rsquo;s how you really live your life, in a period of resistance, adjustment, mutation, then (inaudible), saturation, lag, and recurrences, up and down the ladder of life. You have lived life now, you know the difference between ignorance and truth, if there&rsquo;s no devil, there&rsquo;s no devil, what these particular progressions so the lull is a natural principle, you gotta have breathing space too you know, between one experience to the next experience. But that is what we&rsquo;re talking about, Divine Mother, you have it in a good example of that principle when Jesus came out of the coffin you know and He saw Mary Madeleine and she thought she was looking for her Master and then she recognized someone standing and didn&rsquo;t know it was her Master and took Him for the gardener who took care of the grounds and then when He spoke her name, Mary, and she said &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; what did she try to do to him? Audience: Touch Him? Adano: Right, what he told her? Audience: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me, I haven&rsquo;t ascended.&rdquo; Adano: I haven&rsquo;t what? Audience: Ascended. Adano: Good, so there&rsquo;s a lull period, right? He was like wet cement, a butterfly coming out of the cocoon with the gossamer wings of spirituality still wet, that divine state is still there, He didn&rsquo;t want negative conditions like material things of people&rsquo;s attitudes touching Him yet, He wanted to crystallize in that state, he wanted  to harden in that state, it was his first experience in that state. So until He had cured, the curing process on His atomic structure had taken place, He couldn&rsquo;t let them touch Him. We&rsquo;re dealing with atomic science, we have to understand the peculiarities of it and all the peculiarities of it are in the statements of Jesus, every statement there is a atomic peculiarity or principle, well defined, you just gotta understand it. As I say it&rsquo;s like wet cement, you can&rsquo;t put your finger in wet cement, what would happen? It would leave an impression, right? But when it&rsquo;s dry what you can do? You can put your hands in it, it&rsquo;s cured, you can work with it. Now He&rsquo;s coming through from one level to the next level, He&rsquo;s in what is called the plastic state of pure consciousness whereas Mary was in the concrete state of a lesser consciousness, she would be like a pin and He would be like glue, If you stick a pin into glue what would happen? It would leave an impression in the glue but let the glue harden and you can stick it, you do have to reach a degree of hardness or crystallization but of different ratios of vibrations. He would be at a different ratio of vibration and she would still be at another ratio of vibration yet there is an interplay of the two forces. He would beam down his force on her now and raise her up to him and He had to visit his disciples on three occasions to give them that proof after he came out of the grave. He gave them the evidence in the room when they were by themselves singing the blues then hanging their head down like a Saint Bernard dog, sitting on an old barrel or something, &ldquo;Is this the way to live? Master&rsquo;s gone and leave us all in the ground.&rdquo; Well He came back through the walls, he didn&rsquo;t come through the door so right away there they jump up operation, &ldquo;Ghost!&rdquo; Second time He came back, doubting Thomas was there, &ldquo;Let me see where is this ghost you guys talking about?&rdquo; He wanted to feel, &ldquo;All right come along, feel Mr. Scientist.&rdquo; 1:50 He wasn&rsquo;t doubting Thomas as we think he is, he was just a natural scientist, he wanted to test, experiment, good but that was not enough, Master always ate with them, for the third time what did He do? He fed them and he ate with them so He has three way to test a resurrected Master. When you see the Master Jesus or any of the Masters who passed on and they come to you in your deepest meditation, these are the three levels of tests that they are appearing to you not from a figment of imagination or hallucination, they will materialize to you in the room, you wouldn&rsquo;t see a single shadow if the light is shining, you can&rsquo;t photograph them, there&rsquo;s a vibration that&rsquo;s passing to you by telepathic communication through the eyes, if they want to embrace you, you touch them, they&rsquo;ll touch you but the third time they come they will eat food with you and they will leave a little portion in the plate, that little portion will not decay under any condition, you don&rsquo;t need to refrigerate it. Once they have touched it it&rsquo;s transformed, it&rsquo;s transmuted, you&rsquo;ve got testimony that they really came and talked to you then you know for sure that there is a higher science and it&rsquo;s the true religious science, the Science of the Soul, this is our destiny, this is where we&rsquo;re going, this is our real realization see what I mean? But in the meantime look how much growth you are made: love, compassion, mercy, strength, humility, devotion, all these qualities are being developed in you, can&rsquo;t beat that. Audience: You know I was telling you about Peter before, he was running from the Indonesian government, he had a big price on his head and he met this Master and he is very hungry, no food, so the Master invited him to eat with him and they went to the table, I think there were other people there and the table was empty and (inaudible) so there&rsquo;s no food on the table so he was familiar with Western philosophy, he was a very educated man, he said Jesus said &ldquo;Ask and you shall receive,&rdquo; you understand this is a Christian concept so (inaudible) he says well of course, if you don&rsquo;t believe you cannot ask for food because you don&rsquo;t believe. He shut his eyes for a fraction of a second if they were constantly open, suddenly there was a pop and it was you know simple bread, juice, complete and it wasn&rsquo;t there (inaudible). Adano: Now you see what our education do to us. Audience: Well that&rsquo;s what his did to him, he was going hungry because he couldn&rsquo;t believe to ask so he was going hungry, he was starving and he would have died because he couldn&rsquo;t believe. (Inaudible). Afterward he was changed. Then he told the Master, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go West?&rdquo; You should go out and evangelize, you know why don&rsquo;t you go out and save the world. Adano: You know a funny thing, Bob Raymond told me they don&rsquo;t collect no money from nobody, they always got food that nobody brings, and everybody has a comfortable meal three times a day. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: Just a minute, don&rsquo;t go, let me give you a little Prashad. This is a spiritual food blessed by the Master. There are two ways to take it: one you can put it in your mouth and eat it and forget about it, two you can take it and (inaudible) in the third eye and ask for His blessing to liberate you in this incarnation and eat it, or keep a portion of it and keep it among some candy and give a little of that candy away but keep that portion as a sort of (inaudible), who&rsquo;s first? Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: See in an ashram, it&rsquo;s only the advanced person can handle food, the less developed individuals are not permitted to handle food, they are fed but the advanced disciples is allowed to handle all the food next to the Master see because the food transmits&hellip; the spiritual force is transmitted through the most advanced person through his hand into the food. Audience: This will get sticky, we should eat this now. 2:00 Adano: It&rsquo;s called Prashad. Audience: (Inaudible). Adano: She made me laugh, she said, &ldquo;That big brown figure, I don&rsquo;t know what he was doing with it and I&rsquo;m not gonna put that in my mouth.&rdquo; Audience: (Laughter). Adano: She said &ldquo;Food never tastes like that,&rdquo; her mouth was tingling all over, her stomach all the way through her whole head was like an energy and she was not in that room and she never felt hungry for the whole next day until they brought food to give them, never had no craving for anything like everything suspended itself but she can&rsquo;t forget those big brown fingers. Audience: (Laughter). Well we&rsquo;ll talk to you tomorrow. Adano: Okay Dave, take it easy. Audience: (Goodbyes). Adano: It takes time but the most important thing is to get to yourself, &ldquo;Man, know thyself&rdquo; and all this is part of the whole search. Bye bye sister, take care of yourself. Audience: (Inaudible then gap in tape). Adano: It&rsquo;s only a certain cycle of years and there are four yugas. Now you have Kal Yuga which represents your iron age, it&rsquo;s a period when the consciousness of Man and his development are so crystallized that it doesn&rsquo;t go beyond any more than the mere structure of matter visually by the five senses, he has no comprehension of its inner workings as this magnetism, electronics, and so forth. A piece of wood is a piece of wood, a spade is a spade, a stone is a stone, that&rsquo;s as far as his mentality gets in your iron age or (inaudible) consciousness. Now this is called Kal Yuga or the dark consciousness or the consciousness of pure sensory contact. Now this is divided into one thousand years plus an ascending arc and a descending arc of 100 years on both ends of the thousand, so you have twelve hundred years to that cycle, this was corrected by Sri Yukteswar. Now, then your next cycle would be what you call the bronze age this is 2,000 years with an ascending cycle of 200 years and a descending cycle of 200 years which gives you 2,400 years so that gives you exactly 3,600 years, that&rsquo;s for the iron age and the bronze age together. Now the third cycle which is called your silver age that&rsquo;s only 3,000 years, that period only lasts for 3,000 years and it has an ascending arc of 300 years and a descending arc of 300 years so you have 3,600 years in that cycle. Now the last cycle which you call your golden age only lasts for 4,000 years and it has an ascending cycle of 400 years and a descending cycle of 400 years which gives it 4,800 years in total. Now if you add the 4,800 the 3,600 the 2,400 and the 1,200 we have exactly 12,000 years on one side of the cycle ascending or descending so if it descends in 12,000 it will have to descend in 12,000 years. Recorded history shows Man has been here 10,000 years but that&rsquo;s not true, Man has been here longer but this is what our archaeological facts are showing so far, there are more that have just been just being discovered now that he&rsquo;s been here before that. All they can point to is 10,000 years we call it &ldquo;history&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s not a fall in 12,000 years of the descending arc from the golden period to the dark period. See a golden age to a dark age or a iron age is exactly 12,000 years on the descending arc, on the ascending arc is 12,000 years: 2 times 12 is 24,000 years, your clock span is 24 hour a day, they have to coincide you see your cycles must go inside with your time span so we live in a 24 hour period or a 24,000 cycle span, it took Sri Yukteswar to correct this. Now we have had approximately four 24,000 cycles already that Man has been on this Earth, four times 24,000. Now the Sages they say where did the man get this type of information from? 2:10 Well our Earth is only four and a half billion years old, carbon deposit found so far as to the age of the earth. Now let&rsquo;s multiply 4 times 24,000 and what do we get: 96,000 years all right. In the ruins of Titicaca in Peru, it shows that Man has been here over 120,000 years. Now is four cycles enough to compensate for that reading? Now let&rsquo;s see if a Yuga, which is based on the miscalculated number of 4,370,000 years as the period of Kal Yuga lasts, now let&rsquo;s see if we multiply four times that whole period, if Kal Yuga will last four million and let&rsquo;s say the next the Par would last about eight million and Treta would last about 12 million and Sat Yuga would last about 20 million, add up all these millions, it don&rsquo;t make sense either because the Earth is only four and a half billion years old and Man has not been here that long. There has been a miscalculation due to the cataclysmic action all through the years that threw the thing off cycle. So Sri Yukteswar is saying that we&rsquo;ve had more than four of these golden cycles, more than four silver cycles, more than four bronze cycles, more than four iron cycles or what you call dark ages, we&rsquo;ve had more than four of them you see. Now in his calculation he&rsquo;s not concerned with what happened before because the only way you&rsquo;re gonna reconstruct this you have to work on the ascending cycle. So what has happened before is the descending cycle and you can&rsquo;t go back to the ascending cycle too good to be accurate and find where it&rsquo;s off. So he&rsquo;s taking the ascending cycle, the ascending cycle is that the year Man started again on the planet Earth rediscovering the properties of matter in the form of electron, magnetism, steam, this was his break away now from Kal Yug but that was not the end of Kal Yug, that was at the end of the iron age, it was the break from the iron age. From that day on we had to go into the cusp or the Sandi (sp?) and it&rsquo;s called, and we have so many hundred years in which it had to come out. Now he is writing from the time this was noticed and in the short space of the Sadi from the first discovery of it when Graves and all these men came along and made these discoveries, from that time to Einstein has only been 164 years. The strides made from them to Einstein with the atom was 164 years so it matches exactly what he&rsquo;s calculating. Now we&rsquo;re not in Dvapara, we are in the cusp again, see we wouldn&rsquo;t get into Dvapara before until we are the year 2000, we&rsquo;re still in the cusp you see. So from that period on we are in the Dvapara or what you would call your bronze age. Now these ages were written by the Greeks who were exposed to a four cycle of gold, bronze, silver, and iron but there have been so many gold, silver, bronze, and iron cycles that the Greeks are not recording before that, they&rsquo;re only recording the last one that they&rsquo;ve gone through, it is with the Hindus you have to go back to find where they got their information from, they went further back than that. So Sri Yukteswar is calculating in a different scale and every calculation that he made so far is exact, it falls in exactly you see. Now the question comes up in the Holy Science, what is the final goal? The golden age, right? Now what would a man be in the golden age? Audience: You&rsquo;re describing Satya Sai Baba. Adano: Sai Baba is living in this time span of a realized man that would live and walk in the golden age. See in the golden age Man would have the ability to materialize his thoughts at will and that is not a figment of imagination, this is strictly atomic physics now. The first range of his brain power, the nine tenths portion that is not being used according to scientists would be fully active, how will it become active? It&rsquo;s not only based on the fact that meditation is one process and experimentation is the next process, it is based upon moving in with the planetary system and the sun closer to Alpha Centauri. As this planetary system moves into Alpha Centauri within that apogee, when that time occurs at that particular cycle in time, the radiation from Alpha Centauri will accentuate the mass brain on the planet to that state. Now all the mass brain on that planet will not be in that state, only a certain portion will be in that state, we have an example that right now. The mass brains on this planet are not atomically interested in atomic physics, do you know of a man living in the bushes of Africa interested in making an atom bomb except those who have been exposed to the missionaries. There are tribes of Indians running around in South America has never seen an airplane or heard of one, let alone see a gun, a musket, something that has been made so many hundred years ago. They&rsquo;ve never seen a metal hatchet, there are areas of the Earth where we&rsquo;re definitely having brains that are going to stand still and there&rsquo;s no progress in that direction, radiations are not going to affect them, and there is no exposure for them, strange but this is with us all the time. Yet these are the individuals who Jesus said will inherit your Earth, the meek will inhert the Earth because when future archaeologists come back, they&rsquo;re not going to find civilized world, they&rsquo;re going to find primitive worlds to base their calculations and destroyed civilized worlds. Our lost continents and all these things were considered the height of civilization in those times but we are calculating from that lost continent ideas or lost 50 ideas versus the primitive Man that is living in the area. Can the primitive Man that live in that area be the example of the civilization that has left the architectural ruins there, see what happens to us, wherever we&rsquo;re looking we&rsquo;re faced with this problem. You go into Mexico, you have ruins there, there are very few Indians in that Mexican belt have the capacity to bring out this idea where this thing came from and if you do get to them, they&rsquo;re not going to tell you much and I grew up in South America and I know the Amerindians themselves don&rsquo;t tell you much but for what I&rsquo;ve known of them they all claim there was a time when there was a group of men or a race of men that&hellip;</p>
