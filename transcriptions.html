<h2 id="the-adano-ley-prayer---god-became-you">The Adano Ley Prayer - God Became You</h2>
<p>(punctuation and spacing added)</p>
<p>The Father’s Script is already written.<br>
It could be worse - it’s going to get better.<br>
It’s perfectly balanced in all its working.<br>
Even if it appears irrational and irritable<br>
It’s to build up immunity through resistance.</p>
<p>And understanding acts as a shunt to the Script.<br>
So we must act to be practical, not rational<br>
Through gradations of fixations, illusions and vibrations<br>
Which are all part of the Script<br>
As we watch the Father unfold his Script.</p>
<p>We can do nothing without the Father<br>
Who gives us what we need, not what we want<br>
In order to learn to cope, to stick it out<br>
As we accept What we are in the ever new, unrehearsed<br>
Joy of the moment as Process, not goal.</p>
<p>All experience is neutral and designed in the Script<br>
To always grow in appreciation for each “Thank You.”<br>
In the neutrality, don’t label or computerize or compare.<br>
Simply camerize and see it as it is<br>
And die daily in the confrontative functionality of Life.</p>
<p>You don’t have a body. Consciousness is the body.<br>
God is the consciousness as breath in form<br>
And is the driver taking responsibility in the Script.<br>
Don’t panic. Give thanks for the sky and the clouds and Breathe.<br>
The only place that God is, is in the process of Now.</p>

<p>We use the word enlightenment but sometimes we really don&rsquo;t connect the experience, what it represents in terms of the spiritual life. In the spiritual life the enlightenment is the ability to recognize moment to moment the intrinsic timing of events occurring around you. How you as an individual is at a certain location, a certain time, and your reaction to the conditions based upon your expectancy. In the olden days they would say every action is determined by God, His will be done, but we never really can cope with it or get any experience to say that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will and if we fail we do say it&rsquo;s His will and if we win we do say it&rsquo;s His will but we never really understand what is His will in the first place in terms of the practical exposure, practical day-to-day living. So we tend to search for enlightenment as if it is going to totally eradicate all the veils of the existence. The enlightenment in the daily life and for the human being more than the ordinary  man or woman, the human being per say, in the true spiritualness is recognition of timing. Many of you drove a lot of vehicles to come here, right? Did you buy sixty five hundred dollars worth of parts or sixty five hundred dollars worth of timing? Yet in a simple rational practical existence, it&rsquo;s taken for granted until it&rsquo;s brought into focus what you really have and what you&rsquo;re really experiencing and what frees you now from guilt complex. Spirituality aims to free you from guilt in the experience and aims to let you have the enlightenment or the understanding to be correct that doesn&rsquo;t have a feedback of guilt because there is no good or bad.</p>

<p>Now Man does not know he is Soul in pure consciousness. He always thinks he has a Soul from the structural point of his mechanism so his structural mechanism will say &ldquo;I am&rdquo; and when it says &ldquo;I am&rdquo; it is saying that it is separated from a higher principle and this higher principle is attached to it like a tail attached to an animal. But if the ego in the structural form is subdued and placed to rest or relaxed, then the I AM-ness the higher consciousness which is Soul, begins to pass through. This is the first experience of illumination. This is the awakening of Samadhi to see beyond the five senses, but we&rsquo;ll have our five senses to work with. It is one of the most frustrating and yet most elevating tools that the Creative Intelligence has devised in order to maintain a linkage between the pure consciousness and the stepped down consciousness in the form of matter. You see? What a wonderful alliance, what a wonderful framework of action occurring between structural matter and pure consciousness - that this one pure I AM consciousness, this one I AM experience maintains itself and it&rsquo;s this I AM that is constantly driving, probing, pushing for the outward realization.</p>

<p><strong>From Virginia Beach - 1971 - 0:03 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeICYvhu6ns&amp;t=156s">Audio on YouTube</a></strong></p>
<p>See the presence is always around when you pull in consciousness, try to feel it more and listen because we are constantly in unity or communication from inside. That&rsquo;s why you listen more and the more you listen, the more you&rsquo;ll get the answers to your questions that are coming through your consciousness because it&rsquo;s telegraphed by the love and sometimes you don&rsquo;t need any answers for no questions because what is more important is that you feel love. See we don&rsquo;t have enough love flowing to us in 24 hours and don&rsquo;t even generate enough of it and when you can feel it and generate it then your whole body is transformed gradually, that&rsquo;s the purpose of Darshan or Banderas or various contact with the spiritual guide to help you to feel more love. See it&rsquo;s &ldquo;love the Lord all the time with all your heart, mind, and Soul&rdquo; so you begin to have the loving thankful nature which is pure devotion that everything is being taken care of and you&rsquo;re just trust in this principle of love to take care of it and you will be given the guidance to act. Things fall into place, people come along and before you know it if you&rsquo;re alert and aware you&rsquo;re seeing it&rsquo;s happening in the environment already to what you&rsquo;re looking for, what you need. So it&rsquo;s more of a photo finish existence, this is the purpose of the spiritual life because what is a miracle, just a photofinish experience but it happens all the time so expect the miracle and it&rsquo;s always going to be there. See learning to feel love, feel peace, we don&rsquo;t do much of this in our daily lives and we don&rsquo;t have much organizations centered upon that type of thinking that you sit down and try to incorporate peace into your nature. You have to make it you know, &ldquo;blessed are the peacemakers,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve got to make this peace, you&rsquo;ve got to manufacture it from within yourself by being conscious of it, &ldquo;for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; For they are always at the very center of the reservoir of a being as you try to bring yourself more into peace, you are always staying in that reservoir, you don&rsquo;t go out of the reservoir, you move in the reservoir of peace and this insulates you against the environment, it strengthens you against the environmental pull, the tension of the environment, the repercussions from the environment as you stay within the center of the peace and it&rsquo;s feeling more than thinking, you have to feel. See we hear but we seldom listen and meditation is one of listening not hearing, it&rsquo;s one of feeling. The more you listen and feel, the more you become engulfed in the unity of the joy, you begin to glow in your own being and then the mind don&rsquo;t wander as much, the mind doesn&rsquo;t become restless or irritable, it begins to experience the calmness. Then when the mind is calm then you can direct it on anything you want to do without getting uptight or fatigue or in a state of frustration, you can really concentrate then. See you can&rsquo;t concentrate if you relax, you first got to be tense then relax then concentrate, you first got to create a condition to relax from it in order to focus but to just start off relaxing to concentrate, it don&rsquo;t work that way. That&rsquo;s why you go through the periods of anxiety, tension, restlessness, then you begin to relax from that state. After you relax from the tension, the anxiety, then the mind is calm then it can focus. It&rsquo;s a three-fold movement first tension, relaxation, concentration or centering or being but you gotta have first the resistance, the anxiety, to relax from, to let go from in order to flow or center. So just close the eyes and enjoy peace, enjoy the harmony of being.</p>
